                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editor is convinced that this volume,
                    which was compiled in 1990-1991, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 3 years (1961-1963) of the administration of <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName>. The subseries presents in 25
                    print volumes and 5 microfiche supplements a documentary record of major foreign
                    policy decisions and actions of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                        >Kennedy</persName>'s administration.</p>
                <p>This volume presents the documentary record of major national security policies.
                    A separate microfiche supplement will comprise additional documentation on
                    national security policies regarded by the editor as significant but not
                    warranting inclusion in the printed volume.</p>

                        Foreign Relations Series</hi></p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding
                    issues for which space does not exist in the volume but which will be included
                    in a microfiche supplement.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in
                    accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
                    scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>

                <p>The editor of this volume has defined a “major issue” to be a national security
                    policy or problem that received high-level attention within the U.S. Government;
                    from the President, key White House aides, or Cabinet-level officials; and/or
                    had long-range repercussions for U.S. foreign policy and interests. While it was
                    impossible to include the details of U.S. policy on every national security
                    issue, documentation has been included, either in the print volume or the
                    microfiche supplement, that delineates basic U.S. policies toward the subjects
                    in question.</p>
                <p>The primary focus of the documents in this volume is on the foreign policymaking
                    process of the U.S. Government, including documentation <pb n="VI"
                        xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>illuminating policy formulation and major
                    aspects and repercussions of its execution. Emphasis is placed on official
                    memoranda that reveal policy positions, show differences within the U.S.
                    Government over policy formulation, summarize developments and positions
                    regarding an issue, contain intelligence or military assessments, and describe
                    decisions or actions taken in the National Security Council.</p>
                <p>Documentation selected by the editor for inclusion in the microfiche supplement
                    provides additional details on the major issues covered in this volume. The
                    annotation to printed documents contains references to related documents
                    included in the microfiche supplement. The supplement also includes several
                    lengthy attachments to printed documents. In these cases, the printed document
                    contains editorial references to the microfiche supplement. The volume may be
                    used without the supplement, but the microfiche should be used in conjunction
                    with the printed volume.</p>
                <p>The editor sought principally to cover four interrelated developments in U.S.
                    national security policy: <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Upon taking office, the <persName>Kennedy</persName> administration
                            dismantled much of the existing policymaking machinery of the National
                            Security Council (NSC) and substituted a more unstructured policymaking
                            style. The President met less frequently with the full <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration. In
                            the 1958-1960 triennium, the Council met 125 times, while under

                            for National Security Affairs was enhanced and the administration
                            continuously created issue-oriented, ad hoc bodies to deal with specific

                            to high-level intelligence collections still in the custody of the

                <p>For all topics the major criterion for selection of materials was to document the
                    decisions taken. Where debate over policy occurred, the first priority was to
                    use available materials to set forth discussion at the interagency and White
                    House levels. Where controversy was exceptionally intense and involved a topic
                    of outstanding importance, intra-agency discussion, such as between the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff and the <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>Office of the
                    Secretary of Defense, was included as space permitted. Documents were selected

                            several considerations. Because no <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss>
                            was ever adopted during the triennium, the editor gave preference to
                            actual adopted policy in the competition for space, and he selected
                            materials more for the clarity with which they set forth individual or
                            agency viewpoints than for their comprehensiveness. Where available,
                            Presidential multi-subject policy reviews on major subjects are
                            invariably included.</item>

                            to include materials that show how these policies influenced or were
                            influenced by the foreign policy community as a whole. Certain materials

                            because they contain influential statements of global strategic policy.

                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed

                    as found in the source text, except that obvious typographical errors are
                    silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the

                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>An unnumbered source note to each document indicates the document's source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every
                    effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published,

                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements

                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>

                    Series</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. The editors believe that in terms of
                    access this volume was prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of
                    this statute.</p>
                <p>The editor had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. Certain
                    intelligence-related files maintained in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    became available to the Department historians only after this volume was
                    compiled. Arrangements have been made for Department historians to have full and
                    timely access to these records for future volumes.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                        >Kennedy</persName>, <persName>Johnson</persName>, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and other White House foreign policy
                    records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential
                    libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from other federal agencies including the National Security
                    Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanded access to
                    Department of State historians to high-level intelligence documents from those
                    records in the custody of that Agency. This access is arranged and facilitated
                    by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central
                    Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding. This
                    access arrangement was developed <pb n="XVIII" xml:id="pg_XVIII" facs="0018"/>in
                    connection with the research of volumes for the 1961-1963 triennium and in order
                    to enlarge the scope of coverage as required by the 1991 law. Department of
                    State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue to work out
                    improved procedural and scholarly aspects of identifying the key portions of the
                    intelligence record.</p>
                <p>All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the cooperation and
                    support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>

                <p>All sources for this volume, including a few significant ones that the editor
                    consulted but from which he made no selection, are briefly identified in the
                    list below.</p>
                <p>Collections in the Kennedy Library were the preeminent sources for this
                    compilation, but the editor made use of valuable materials in the files of the
                    Department of State, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and its
                    subdivisions, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (including the Chairman's File), the
                    Papers of <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Maxwell D. Taylor</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lyman L. Lemnitzer</persName> at the National Defense
                    University, the Papers of <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Arleigh A.
                        Burke</persName> at the Naval Historical Center, the <persName
                        corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> Library in Abilene, Kansas
                    (for the beginning of 1961), and the <persName>Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>
                    Library in Austin, Texas (for the close of 1963).</p>
                <p>Among Kennedy Library materials, the single most important collection was the
                    National Security Files (NSF), which represent the office files of <persName
                        corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>. Within it the Department of
                    Defense subsection of the Departments and Agencies Series was especially useful,
                    and the subsections for the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and
                    the Central Intelligence Agency were also consulted. The few minutes or
                    memoranda of formal National Security Council meetings are from the Meetings and
                    Memoranda Series of the NSF, as are some of the ancillary materials to the
                    National Security Action Memoranda (NSAMs). The latter are brief memoranda used
                    by the President, or Bundy on his behalf, to issue policy directives or to
                    inform leading officials of decisions taken, either by means of or without the
                    full National Security Council. The Meetings and Memoranda Series also has
                    folders containing papers of key members of the White House Staff: <persName

                        >Chester V. Clifton</persName>. The files of Clifton, who was Military Aide
                    to the President, include the memoranda of most of the President's meetings with
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>

                        enclosed with a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge
                            Bundy</persName> the undated 27-page “Report to Senator
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s National Security Policy Committee.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul H. Nitze</persName> headed this
                        Committee, the other members of which were <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1"
                            >David K. E. Bruce</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Roswell
                            Gilpatric</persName>. The report opened with an analysis of defense
                        policy issues. Concerning the first, “Basic Strategic Judgments,” the
                        Committee stated in part:</p>
                    <p>“The most basic issue is between attempting to follow a politically
                        meaningful ‘win’ capability in general war versus the creation of a secure
                        retaliatory capability.</p>
                    <p>“Weapons systems and programs necessary for a ‘win’ capability may differ
                        quite radically from those required for a secure retaliatory capability.</p>
                    <p>“A true ‘win’ capability would require accurate and powerful attack systems,
                        first class target acquisition systems, elaborate active and passive defense
                        systems, forces for the prosecution of the second and third phases of a
                        general war and a good recuperation program. It is doubtful whether such a
                        capability is possible within presently foreseeable technology. In any case
                        it would be immensely expensive both economically and politically to make an
                        all out drive toward achieving such a capability. It would also probably
                        require a first or preemptive strike by our side to capitalize in its ‘win’
                        possibilities. Furthermore, such a capability would probably be
                        destabilizing—in other words would increase the danger of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>“On the other hand there are very great political and military dangers in
                        having merely a punitive retaliatory capability with no possibility of a
                        ‘win’. If deterrence were to fail, or threaten to fail, we would be left
                        with no option for military action other than a self-defeating punitive
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>“A pure retaliatory capability therefore undermines the credibility of the
                        deterrent and gives little or no support to the political aspects of our
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>“It would therefore seem that in addition to a secure deterrent posture, some
                        admixture of possible ‘win’ capabilities is called for.</p>
                    <p>“A general approach to the ‘mix’ of general war capabilities to be striven
                        for should be determined by the President-elect, as early as full briefing
                        by those knowledgeable in the subject can be arranged.”</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0034"/>
                    <p>The Committee called for an early Presidential decision on the degree to
                        which the United States should rely on nuclear weapons in limited wars. It
                        stated that “judgments as to the circumstances under which nuclear war must
                        be accepted as unavoidable, who should have his hand on the safety catches
                        and the triggers of nuclear war and the nature of the original target
                        systems, should deterrence fail, must all be made by the President. These
                        judgments are inherently not delegatable.”</p>
                    <p>Other defense policy issues discussed in the report include specific defense
                        programming decisions, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> issues, the
                        fiscal and organizational implications of defense policy, and the
                        relationship of disarmament to defense.</p>
                    <p>The report identified several other issues as having national security
                        implications: the gold drain and the U.S. balance of payments, U.S.
                        representation at the United Nations, and a number of European and other
                        area problems. The report emphasized that the Department of State needed
                        “strengthening in its competence on military problems. State can't give
                        intelligence guidance on politico-military questions unless it has people
                        who in addition to political competence thoroughly understand military
                        matters, including questions of military strategy, tactics and
                        logistics.”</p>
                    <p>The Committee believed that “the top level coordination machinery in the
                        White House [was] peculiarly a matter of the President's personal desires
                        and needs.” It suggested that a number of existing interagency advisory
                        committees be brought under the “<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> tent.”
                        The Operations Coordinating Board “has been a great generator of useless
                        paper work and might be scrapped and a new start made.” The report
                        recommended “a series of ad hoc task forces to develop plans and direct
                        operations on critical upcoming situations involving a high component of
                        secret operations,” and mentioned potential groups dealing with Cuba, the
                        Congo, and Indochina, and also a “central secretariat which would service
                        the entire panoply of interagency committees associated with the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>'s work.” Such a body “would perform some of
                        the functions of the British Cabinet Secretariat.” The full text of the

                        Situation</hi></p>
                    <p>60. Despite a widespread feeling that allout nuclear war is unlikely, the
                        problem posed by the accumulation of offensive weapons of mass destruction
                        by the great powers will remain the major problem of the 1960's. Although we
                        have been unable to agree upon an estimate of the size of the Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program (estimates range from 200—or
                        perhaps even less—to 700 on launcher for mid-1963), the Soviet capability
                        even at the lowest estimated figure will pose a grave threat to the US. To
                        illustrate, if one assumes the number on launcher to be 200 and applies
                        reasonable rates of reliability to the missile, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> could detonate in the US in the target area some 1,000 to
                        1,250 megatons. The even greater delivery capability provided by shorter
                        range missiles and nuclear weapons deliverable by aircraft or submarines and
                        ships poses an additional threat to the US, to US bases overseas, to US
                        allies, and indeed to most of the northern hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>61. So far as we can see now, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        undertook to deliver such an attack, the US could do little to prevent
                        enormous damage. A US pre-emptive attack—that is, an attack delivered when a
                        Soviet attack was believed to be imminent—would not prevent such damage
                        unless the various types of Soviet missile launchers had been precisely
                        located, and there is doubt that a high proportion could be so located.
                        Antiballistic missile systems of presently unproven effectiveness will
                        probably be available about the middle of the decade, but such early systems
                        almost certainly will not be sufficiently developed or widely-enough
                        deployed <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0036"/>to give assurance of
                        destroying or neutralizing more than a small proportion of the missiles
                        which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be capable of
                            launching.<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">The Assistant Chief of Staff for
                            Intelligence, Department of the Army, concurs in the net judgment
                            contained in this paragraph and the succeeding paragraphs that, so far
                            as can now be seen, a general nuclear war would cause enormous damage to
                            all major protagonists and that resort to general nuclear war, under
                            these circumstances, is not a rational course of action. He believes,
                            however, that the intelligence community is unable to adjudge the
                            capability of the US to develop an effective defense against ballistic
                            missiles. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                    <p>62. The US, however, will also almost certainly be able to do enormous damage
                        to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, even if attacked first by the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is true that during the next
                        year or so the vulnerability of US retaliatory forces to a surprise missile
                        attack and the uncertainties regarding the size of the Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force introduce some measure of doubt
                        regarding the extent of the US retaliatory capability. It is very unlikely,
                        however, that even during this period the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> will acquire capabilities sufficient to give it confidence
                        that it can prevent an unacceptable level of US retaliation.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d2fn3">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, does not concur. As previously
                            stated in his footnote to <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-4-60,
                            “Main Trends in Soviet Capabilities and Policies, 1960-1965,” dated 1
                            December 1960, he feels that we are entering a very critical twenty-four
                            month period in which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may well
                            sense that it has the advantage. The Soviet leaders may press that
                            advantage and offer the US the choice of war or of backing down on an
                            issue heretofore considered vital to our national interests. [Footnote
                            in the source text.]</note> As the decade advances, the US program of
                        maintaining a portion of the US bomber force on airborne alert and of
                        dispersing missiles in hardened sites, aboard submarines at sea, and on
                        railborne carriers should virtually assure the survival of a substantial
                        retaliatory capability. The Soviets are pursuing a vigorous program for
                        developing antimissile defenses, and we estimate that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably begin to deploy an
                        antimissile system of undetermined effectiveness by the period 1963-1966.
                        The Soviet leaders probably believe that they will acquire a military
                        advantage through protection of selected areas and through complicating the
                        task of Western military planners. They almost certainly consider that the
                        first nation to deploy such weapons will gain major psychological,
                        political, and military advantages. Nevertheless, we believe it almost
                        certain that these defenses throughout the period will remain inadequate to
                        shield large areas of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> from
                        widespread devastation.</p>
                    <p>63. Thus it appears likely that during most of the decade ahead the strategic
                        situation will be one in which both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> will possess relatively invulnerable nuclear weapons
                        systems capable of inflicting enormous destruction upon the other. The world
                        must face the possibility that a general nuclear war—brought to pass through
                        accident, design, or miscalculation—would kill many millions of people,
                        destroy the capital accumulation of many decades, render large sections <pb
                            n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0037"/>of the earth virtually uninhabitable
                        for a time, and destroy the power of most of the modern nations of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>64. This strategic situation does not make general nuclear war impossible,
                        but it does make it a highly irrational response to international disputes.
                        As long as this situation continues, each side will be deterred by fear of
                        the consequences (if by nothing else) from deliberately initiating general
                        war. It is almost certain, moreover, that each side will be deterred from
                        action or policies which involve serious risk of general war. The crucial
                        question is: how will the risks of a given action be judged in the context
                        of circumstances which exists when the action is contemplated? To be more
                        specific: how far will the Soviets—or the Chinese Communists—be emboldened
                        by judging that Western reaction to some Communist aggression will be
                        inhibited by Western aversion to incurring serious risk of general war? To
                        what extent will the Western reaction actually be so inhibited? Such
                        questions as these are likely to be decisive in any sharp international
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>65. But apart from the calculation of risks in times of crisis, this
                        strategic situation poses other serious problems for policymakers. How long
                        will it persist? Can either side achieve a clear military superiority? If
                        the situation of mutual deterrence does persist, can nuclear war be
                        prevented from occurring by accident? Can nuclear blackmail be countered?
                        Can nuclear armaments be reduced or eliminated without creating unfair
                        advantage or opportunities for evasion? We do not pretend to offer answers,
                        but only to point out in the paragraphs below some of the military and
                        political problems which we believe this strategic situation has created and
                        will create in the decade ahead.</p>

                    <p>66. There is much ignorance and uncertainty among military and civilian
                        leaders throughout the world—in both Communist and non-Communist
                        countries—about the present and future world military situation. <pb n="6"
                            xml:id="pg_6" facs="0038"/>This is due in part to security restrictions
                        between governments and even within governments, in part to the complex
                        technical and operational factors involved in modern military actions, and
                        in part to the fact that the destructive potential of modern weapons is
                        unprecedented in human history. Even among the politically and militarily
                        sophisticated, there is considerable puzzlement and disagreement about the
                        deterrent effect of present and future nuclear capabilities, about the
                        probable behavior of states in critical situations, and about the most
                        suitable and effective strategic doctrines and weapons systems to
                        develop.</p>
                    <p>67. These problems must trouble the Soviet leaders as much as they trouble
                        those of the West. We do not believe that the Soviet leaders conceive the
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> to be the final answer to their
                        military problems, and we doubt that they have formed definite ideas about
                        their force structure ten years hence or about the precise role they will
                        assign to military power in their campaign to establish world communism.
                        They now see themselves as emerging from a period of strategic inferiority,
                        and they surely consider it a prime objective not to let the US draw ahead
                        once more. As long as the weapons race persists, they will not be content
                        with a strategic equilibrium, or with the progress they have hitherto made
                        in weapons development. Beyond that, they will continue to carry on
                        scientific and weapons research and development programs with a high sense
                        of urgency in order to find new weapons systems and defenses against
                        existing ones. They would do this even without dream of vast military
                        conquests, simply in the interest of defense. But if they developed a
                        weapons system which gave promise of decided advantage over the US, they
                        would certainly seek to gain maximum profit from it.</p>
                    <p>68. In the decade ahead some such weapons—for example, one providing defense
                        against missiles—may achieve operational status and tend to upset the
                        nuclear missile terror balance we have described. From what we know of
                        Soviet ideas, however, we conclude that during the next five years—and
                        perhaps longer—the Soviet leaders will conceive of their long-range striking
                        capability in terms of deterrence and of employment in a heavy blow should
                        they finally conclude that deterrence had failed, rather than in terms of
                        the deliberate initiation of general war. In their view, a condition of
                        mutual deterrence will provide an umbrella under which they can wage a
                        vigorous campaign, using a wide variety of methods, throughout the
                        non-Communist world.<note n="5" xml:id="d2fn5">The Assistant Chief of Staff,
                            Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, does not concur in
                            this paragraph. It is his belief that the evidence of offensive missile
                            and bomber production and deployment shows a definite intent by the
                            Soviet rulers to achieve a clear military superiority at the earliest
                            practicable date. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>

                    <p>69. In such a circumstance the Soviet leaders will have substantial
                        advantages. They can create crises and issue threats over comparatively
                        minor matters with a reasonable degree of confidence that one or more of the
                        Western powers will give way because of the risks of general war involved in
                        resisting. In circumstances where they judge the risk is not too great they
                        might engage in military action, possibly with Soviet forces but more
                        probably with other bloc forces or with local revolutionary armed groups. In
                        any case where it appeared that the choice for resisters was one between
                        massive nuclear destruction and compromise of principle (including even
                        surrender of territory), large numbers of people around the world would
                        choose the latter.</p>
                    <p>70. It is now widely held that, in order to prevent such a paralyzing choice
                        from being presented, it is necessary to have limited war capabilities, so
                        that comparatively minor threats can be countered with appropriate means.
                        But in recent years limited war capabilities in the West have been declining
                        rather than rising. There has been a trend toward the reduction of budgetary
                        allocations for the modernization and mobility of limited-war-capable
                        forces. Two of the US allies, for reasons of national prestige, or because
                        they fear that the US will not always support them, have carried on
                        strategic nuclear weapons programs of their own and have reduced their
                        conventional forces.</p>
                    <p>71. Even if substantial limited war forces should be available, many of the
                        principles of their political and military use in a nuclear age remain to be
                        developed and to be accepted. It is clear, for example, that only limited
                        objectives can be won by limited means, and that pursuit of broad objectives
                        or extension of the conflict beyond a well defined area of combat threatens
                        expansion into a major war and poses for both sides the question of
                        undertaking a large-scale pre-emptive attack on the enemy's homeland. Even
                        when both parties accept limitations upon their objectives and upon the area
                        of combat, the rules of combat within that established area still pose
                        problems. One of these is that of using nuclear weapons for tactical
                        advantage. The use of nuclear weapons in almost any form would greatly
                        complicate both the military and political problem. It would almost
                        certainly confuse the enemy and the neutrals as to the user's real
                        intentions—as distinct from his announced ones—and alienate large and
                        influential sectors of world opinion from the cause of the user, however
                        just it may have been. The Soviets would presumably regard the use of
                        nuclear weapons in the light of the proposition which they repeatedly assert
                        and probably believe—that limited wars would carry particularly great risks
                        of spreading into general war if nuclear weapons were introduced.</p>
                    <p>72. From a political point of view, there are also questions about the
                        circumstances in which one can intervene with limited forces. As a general
                        rule and as a result of the experience of Korea, the Communist powers <pb
                            n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0040"/>will probably try to avoid clear-cut
                        provocations which would permit the West to bring limited war capabilities
                        to bear. They will instead attempt to use situations which are legally or
                        politically anomalous, that is, situations in which they have a defensible
                        color of right for the use of force or in which the political issue has
                        become or can be made to appear so confused as to make Western intervention
                        seem capricious or imperialistic. Much will depend upon the way in which the
                        issue is presented to the world and is handled by both sides. In many
                        circumstances fear of the spread of the conflict into a general nuclear war
                        might be so great that the intervener would find himself severely condemned
                        by large segments of world opinion.</p>
                    <p>73. A major problem during the next decade is also posed by the probability
                        that additional nations will acquire a nuclear weapons capability. France
                        already has a program underway, and Communist China and Israel almost
                        certainly have started such weapons programs. Other nations might enter the
                        field if only to counter the power and prestige which their rivals or their
                        enemies might gain through the acquisition of a nuclear capability. Even a
                        small increase in the number of nations possessing nuclear weapons will add
                        to the dangers inherent in critical situations as they arise. An increase in
                        the number of states capable of using nuclear weapons—even as a threat—will
                        also increase the chances for irrational and desperate action. At a minimum,
                        the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities will stir up additional political
                        turmoil by encouraging intransigence in their possessors and by encouraging
                        fear and counteraction among those who might consider themselves
                        threatened.</p>
                    <p>74. Related to these problems of limited war and spread of nuclear
                        capabilities is the problem of preventing miscalculations which might
                        precipitate general war unintentionally. Whenever international disputes
                        arise there is a natural tendency for the parties concerned to place their
                        forces on an alert status and progressively to strengthen the alert by
                        various forms of deployment. In some cases these might be normal precautions
                        and in some cases they might be intended to frighten the adversary, or both.
                        In any case, there is likely to be considerable concern among neutrals and
                        US allies that the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will act
                        in too bellicose a fashion, that both the US and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might become so committed that they would
                        be unable to back down and thus would become involved in war, or that the
                        state of alert on one side or both will become so advanced that, fearing a
                        surprise attack, one would take pre-emptive action against the other. As the
                        decade advances and surprise attack against retaliatory weapons systems
                        loses much of its advantage, compelling reasons for launching a pre-emptive
                        attack will no longer exist. Nevertheless, fear of surprise attack will
                        probably persist and might weigh more heavily in the minds of policymakers
                        than would in fact be justified.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0041"/>
                    <p>75. Another concern is that general war may come about by sheer accident. The
                        worry here is that with an increasing number and variety of space capsules
                        in orbit or being fired into orbit, with an increasing number of missiles
                        nuclear-armed and on the ready, with strategic air forces airborne and armed
                        with nuclear weapons, with a new and untested ballistic missile early
                        warning system in operation, war could come about through communications
                        failures or anomalies, irrational action by local crews or commanders, or
                        errors in judgment, without either side wishing this to happen. As the
                        decade advances and surprise attack loses some of its advantages, there will
                        no longer be compelling reasons to respond immediately to supposed or actual
                        infringements of air space by presumably hostile missiles or aircraft.
                        Nevertheless, fear of attack might in some circumstances be so great that
                        general war could come about in ways we have noted.</p>
                    <p>76. In this situation of widespread fear of a general nuclear war, it is
                        natural that the people of the world should look to arms control as a means
                        of reducing the danger. Whatever its motivation, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has carried on a many-sided campaign for
                        general and complete disarmament. The Soviet leaders probably are interested
                        in achieving some degree of disarmament, to an extent which would at least
                        slow down or stop developments which might harm their strategic position or
                        increase the danger of accidental war. During the decade, it is possible
                        that both sides will become sufficiently concerned with stabilizing the
                        balance of terror that some limited agreements may be reached. In any case,
                        it is possible that—in order both to achieve stabilization and to meet world
                        pressures for reducing the danger of war—the two sides will undertake tacit
                        agreements resulting in some degree of arms limitation.</p>
                    <p>77. Also, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is likely to continue to be
                        regarded by its members as an instrument for the prevention of war. If two
                        nations are involved in dispute that threatens to result in a general war
                        which they wish to avoid, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might
                        provide a useful forum for airing the dispute and <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> action a useful excuse for emerging from the dispute with
                        less than full satisfaction. Moreover, the underdeveloped nations, who are
                        likely to become an increasingly powerful voice in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, will almost certainly feel it in their
                        interest to prevent a general war and will therefore exert their influence
                        for the preservation of peace.</p>
                    <p>78. While there is some reason to expect, therefore, that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> may play a role in preserving peace, that the
                        present balance of forces will persist or become stabilized, that the
                        limited war concept may be sufficiently capable of development to provide an
                        escape from nuclear blackmail and general nuclear war, and that chances of
                        general war coming about by accident or fear of surprise attack may be
                        reduced, the decade ahead will still be an extremely dangerous one. The
                        Soviets see increasing opportunities for political gains in their new
                        strategic position, in their <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0042"/>economic
                        growth, and in the changing situation in the underdeveloped areas. They are
                        almost certain to test these opportunities, and such tests could give rise
                        to serious crises. Berlin and the Offshore Islands exemplify situations in
                        which retreat may become impossible, and civil wars in such areas on the
                        periphery of the Sino-Soviet Bloc as Laos could pose grave questions
                        concerning the objectives and rules for the conduct of limited operations.
                        The world contest in the decade ahead will necessarily be conducted in the
                        shadow of this strategic situation, and it will affect the decisions of
                        statesmen everywhere.</p>

                    <p>The President first told the group that General <persName corresp="#p_CCV1"
                            >Clifton</persName> would be taking over from me the Defense Liaison
                        functions. He expressed appreciation for the help I have been enabled to
                        give him by staying on for a short while. He said he would hope to make use
                        of General <persName corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName> in order to stay
                        in very close touch with the Chiefs. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> confirmed that it has been valuable to have
                        someone here with whom the Chiefs could take up specific items, and whom
                        they could get to take up questions with the President for them. The
                        President said he is extremely anxious to keep in close contact with the
                        Chiefs. He recognized that he <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0044"/>would
                        be seeing General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>
                        frequently when he comes to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings,
                        attends meetings with the Secretary of State, etc.</p>
                    <p>The President cited as an instance of the kind of help he needed the
                        suggestion that the timing of the SAMOS shot and the Baltic reconnaissance
                        flight should be modified so as to remove them from the date of the release
                        of the RB-47 flyers.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of Laos (see <ref target="frus1961-63v24#d12"><hi

                            Document 26</ref>), and the Congo.]</p>
                    <p>The President referred to comments made by Mr. <persName>Gates</persName> at
                        the meeting on January 19th regarding limited war,<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2"
                            >See <ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> quoting the Chiefs as
                        saying that we could handle requirements in two areas at once, providing
                        they did not, together, exceed the scope of the Korean hostilities. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> observed that the
                        President has the authority to call in the reserve of one million men, but
                        he noted that this could only serve a purpose if we had sea lift ready and
                        the ability to support them. He said we would quickly exceed what could be
                        done with air support. It was his view that we need more air transport than
                        we now have. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> noted
                        that we have one division of Marines in the Pacific and one-half division in
                        the Atlantic completely ready to go. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> said that what could be done would be to establish
                        an initial position by air and quickly shift its support to sea traffic.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would like to have a memorandum bringing out what, if
                        we were to decide to commit American troops in Laos, we could do in the way
                        of a buildup, in 30 days. He asked that it cover how fast the Viet Minh
                        could come into the situation. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> said they could come in fast, but we could cut
                        their supply lines and limit what they could do.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that if we
                        took units out of our ready forces, we would want to replace them quickly
                        with units from the reserves. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1"
                            >Decker</persName> said there are three divisions ready to go in <gloss
                            target="#t_STRAC1">STRAC</gloss>. Also, the 25th Division, less one
                            <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>, is in Hawaii, with the <gloss
                            target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> in Okinawa. There are seven national guard
                        divisions that have been designated to be called in to replace any units
                        committed.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what efforts have been made to prevent the experience we
                        had with our prisoners of war in Korea. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1"
                            >Decker</persName> reported that a code of conduct has been prepared and
                        that there are programs of indoctrination. It is recognized that there would
                        be brainwashing, but the men know much better what to do. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> confirmed that training has been
                        intensive—on occasion involving the acting out of what can be done to
                        maintain order and morale in a prison camp. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> observed that those who believe in
                        something can <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0045"/>and will stand up in
                        such a situation. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>
                        said he thought the situation was infinitely better than in 1950, when the
                        armed forces were at a very low ebb. The units committed in Korea from Japan
                        were at a low state of training and readiness. The President asked what
                        caliber of people are coming into the service. All present said that the
                        caliber is extremely high. General <persName corresp="#p_WLC1"
                            >White</persName> said it is proving hard to keep people of this degree
                        of competence after they finish their required service, but he said that the
                        personnel of the Air Force are far superior to what they have had before.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> said the same is true
                        of the Marine Corps. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName>
                        said that the officers and men of the Army are the best ever. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> added that the
                        authority that was granted to the Army to reject drafted personnel has been
                        of tremendous value. Through screening out the unfit, great savings have
                        been made—for example, four of the Army's five disciplinary barracks have
                        been closed. The President said he would like to have the group think about
                        the problem of how to build up the status of the Army. He said that the
                        other services have advantages which the Army does not seem to have. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> said he was delighted to
                        hear this expression by the President and would certainly give it very great
                        attention. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> said that
                        in many ways the Navy has the toughest problem, as is reflected now in its
                        rate of reenlistment, which is the lowest in the whole Defense
                        establishment. This arises out of the great amount of time the men must
                        spend at sea. For example, last year the men of a carrier he named
                        (Saratoga?) spent only twenty nights ashore.</p>
                    <p>The President asked for an expression of opinion regarding the actions that
                        had been taken because of the gold outflow. He noted that this matter is
                        under intensive review. All of the Chiefs said that this has had a very
                        serious impact, extending all the way back into the rate of applications for
                        entrance to the Academies. This has been very rough treatment for personnel,
                        and has created a terrible problem.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the Deputy Director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> must be a military man. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said he thought this was not
                        required but was permissive. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> went on to mention a recent intelligence
                        management study, out of which may soon develop a proposal for a Deputy
                        Director of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, making it possible to
                        separate the Director of Central Intelligence from the operating
                        functions.</p>
                    <p>The President asked as to the status of the Coast Guard, and Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> told him that it is under
                        the Treasury in peacetime.</p>
                    <p>The President said he wants to stay very close to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                        He said the American people are very bellicose in their attitudes and
                        objectives with respect to Russia and Cuba, but at the same time, they very
                        strongly do not want to go to war. He said he doubts that they can have this
                        both ways. However, he is sure that, when we are spending <pb n="14"
                            xml:id="pg_14" facs="0046"/>$82 billion on our budget, we should be
                        certain we have everything we really need in the military sphere.</p>
                    <p>As the President concluded the meeting, General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> said the Chiefs would welcome very much the chance
                        to continue to meet with the President, and would be very happy if he should
                        visit them in the Pentagon. The President said he would hope to see them
                        frequently, in addition to his meetings with General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>. He concluded by saying he had
                        been extremely well impressed with the appearance of the officers in the
                        Inauguration parade. Now he thought it is important to get the
                        non-commissioned officers to feeling that it is highly creditable to be in
                        the service of their country.</p>

                    <p>On January 26, 1961, members of the team that had prepared <gloss
                            target="#t_WSEG1">WSEG</gloss> Report No. 50, “Evaluation of Strategic
                        Offensive Weapons Systems,” dated December 27, 1960, gave Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> a briefing on the
                        Report. <gloss target="#t_WSEG1">WSEG</gloss>-50 concluded that
                        intercontinental ballistic missiles would be the most effective strategic
                        weapons by the mid-1960s, that “counterforce alone [did] not appear to be a
                        high confidence measure for preventing unacceptable levels of damage to the
                        U.S. in the event of war,” even if the United States struck first, and that
                        the United States “should be able to maintain a strong retaliatory posture
                        even in the face of threats larger by far than any indicated by intelligence
                        estimates.” Therefore “both the U.S. and the Soviet Union should be able to
                        maintain a retaliatory force capable of inflicting great damage, which
                        cannot be neutralized by the other side without a major technological
                        breakthrough.”</p>
                    <p>In the face of this “nuclear stalemate,” the United States should “develop
                        and maintain a retaliatory force that clearly can do high levels of damage”
                        regardless of how a war started, and should also reduce “the threat of use
                        of strategic forces to issues that can be resolved in no other way.” To this
                        end, the United States with its allies should “develop and deploy forces to
                        meet local aggression locally, and in such a manner as to minimize the
                        expansion of the limited war into general war.” The summary <pb n="15"

                        policies that can be adequately performed at lower levels in the government
                        by planning and operating officials who are aware of and responsive to the
                        over-all policy directions of the Administration. The intent, therefore, of

                        to provide a “nervous system” through which the impact of the President's

                                the device by which the Special Assistant to the President would
                                secure the concurrence of the appropriate agencies in steps to be

                                recommendations need referral to the President or can be put into
                                effect by the concurrence of the principal departments involved. The
                                Special Assistant to the President would also refer policies to this

                                policies for which they have the present responsibility of
                                evaluation in terms of operational requirements and for preparing
                                drafts of Operations Plans. These working groups need
                                re-invigoration. In this connection certain steps need to be taken
                                as soon as the major adjustments described above have taken place.
                                The more important of these steps are: (a) improved backstopping of
                                the working group representation in the departments and agencies
                                participating in the group; (b) improved representation on the
                                working group; and (c) a clear expression of support for this
                                process by the White House and by the heads of the agencies
                                involved. The working groups would normally be chaired by the agency
                                having the principal responsibility. On all geographic working
                                groups this is the Department of State, which is concrete evidence
                                of the primacy of the State Department's coordinating role in this
                                area, but the working group, on the other hand, is part of a
                                Presidentially-established mechanism responsible to and receiving
                                its instructions from a representative of the President.</item>

                        <item>The most urgent need is for a review of basic military policy. What is
                            our view of the kind of strategic force we need, the kinds of
                            limited-war forces, the kind of defense for the continental U.S., and
                            the strategy of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>? What should be
                            your thinking about the great decisions, at crisis moments, on levels of
                            U.S. military action? The urgency of these matters arises from existing
                            papers which in the view of nearly all your civilian advisers place a
                            debatable emphasis (1) on strategic as against limited-war forces, (2)
                            on “strike-first,” or “counter-force” strategic planning, as against a
                            “deterrent” or “second-strike” posture, and (3) on decisions-in-advance,
                            as against decisions in the light of all the circumstances. These three
                            forces in combination have created a situation today in which a
                            subordinate commander faced with a substantial Russian military action
                            could start the thermonuclear holocaust on his own initiative if he
                            could not reach you (by failure of communication at either end of the
                            line). There are good arguments for the decisions which led to this
                            situation, but there are arguments on the other side, and it seems
                            absolutely essential that you satisfy yourself, as President, on these
                            basic matters. Moreover, a review of this sort should include at all
                            stages the relevant political questions, and it should go along the
                            whole spectrum from thermonuclear weapons systems to guerrilla action
                            and political infiltration. Our current troubles in Laos and other
                            places seem to arise at least in part from too narrow and conventional
                            thinking about “military” as opposed to “political” problems.</item>

                        <item>Our first problem is to decide how to get these matters studied out so

                            your own assessment of the complex issues involved. In the past these
                            matters have generally been settled in the light of pressure and
                            argument mainly from interested parties—the Air Force especially, but
                            others too. All of us are agreed that a better way must be found.</item>

                            good deal to be said, from your standpoint, in having two studies,
                            especially if those in charge of them (<persName corresp="#p_NPH1"

                            keep each other in full touch as they go along. The matter is of
                            literally life-and-death importance, and it also has plenty of political
                            dynamite in it, so that the more advice you get, the better off you will

                            should be full consultation with the military at all stages and a fully

                        <item>While the largest and hardest questions in this can of worms are
                            judgment questions, with a combined military-political-diplomatic
                            meaning, there are also some technical issues which can be attacked best
                            by <persName corresp="#p_WJB1">Wiesner</persName> through special
                            studies by qualified scientific leaders. We believe, for example, that
                            Air Force planning is based on very doubtful technical judgments on the
                            damage that will be done by given weapons exploded on given targets.
                            This can be studied by George Kistiakowsky if you wish, and the result
                            might show that we need much less expensive plans than we now

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Dean</persName></hi>:</p>
                    <p>The President has asked me to start to keep track of directives and requests
                        which he makes in the area of national security affairs. Such requests and
                        actions may come from memoranda of his, from phone calls which he makes or
                        asks one of his assistants to make, or they may come from discussions which
                        he has directly with members of the Administration in private meetings, or
                        they may come out of the discussions of the National Security Council.
                        Wherever they come from, he is eager to keep track of the things which he
                        personally initiates.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, we are beginning a series of National Security Action Memoranda,
                        and I enclose herewith the ones which relate to your Department from the
                        last discussion of the National Security Council.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2"
                            >Enclosed is <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 3; see <ref
                                target="#d8fn5">footnote 5, Document 8</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>It is not our intention to pester the departments and agencies with untimely
                        follow-up messages on these action memoranda, and I have <pb n="24"
                            xml:id="pg_24" facs="0056"/>the strong impression, from my brief
                        experience, that departments and agencies will always be acting just as fast
                        as they can to respond to the President's directives. At the same time, it
                        is obviously important to him to have some orderly procedure for follow-up.
                        So we will try to keep track over here as each problem is acted on, and will
                        bother you only if in the normally brisk dispatch of business we are not in
                        the position to tell the President what is happening.</p>
                    <p>I hope that this method of action may seem sensible to you, and if you have
                        any questions I hope you will let me know.</p>

                            30, 1960, emphasized increasing U.S. capability for operations short of

                            follows the format and much of the substance of the June 30 memorandum,
                            but with even greater emphasis on non-nuclear options in Europe and on
                            counter-guerrilla capabilities elsewhere.</note> This should be looked
                        upon as preliminary to the long-range study of the U.S. military posture on
                        which you and we are shortly to be engaged.</p>
                    <p>We will give this matter continuing study and will advise you of any further
                        thoughts we may have.</p>
                    <p>I would be glad to discuss these considerations with you, or to have them

                                capability to deal with threats to the internal security of
                                free-world states, such as the threat of guerrilla insurgency, is
                                urgently needed. These threats have recently been stepped up by the
                                Communists and their allies, and it is likely they will be further
                                expanded and extended. Free world capabilities to meet these threats
                                must include US ability to give to the indigenous elements charged
                                with maintaining internal security in individual countries advice,
                                training and assistance which is tailored to the tasks they

                                Communist policy is likely to pose such threats, with emphasis on
                                infiltration and guerrilla warfare, with greater urgency in the
                                years ahead.</item>

                            insurgency, where it is present, if they do not have to keep an undue
                            proportion of their forces inactive to guard against overt invasion.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, important not only to have mobile, flexible and
                            substantial US forces (para. 2) but also to have them deployed in
                            forward areas of the western Pacific, in order to present our allies and
                            the Communists with tangible evidence of our capacity to respond to
                            aggression. As a related task, the State and Defense Departments and
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should give urgent attention to

                    <p>The President asked General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> if
                        the magazine which prepared the extensive “sell” on the Nike/Zeus was his
                        magazine. There <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0060"/>was some confusion
                        because both <hi rend="italic">Missiles and Rockets and Army Magazine</hi>
                        had come out within the last week.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> explained to the
                        President <hi rend="italic">Army Magazine</hi> and its relation to the
                        Association of the U.S. Army. Then the Chiefs told about the various
                        associations, including the Navy League and the Air Force Association, and
                        the magazines published, both officially and unofficially.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> briefed the
                        President on his weekend visit with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1"

                            >SIOP</gloss>. He said the operation plan goes into effect April 1st,
                        although it was approved on December 1st.<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">By
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.</note> He
                        gave the President quite a few details on how targets are covered. The
                        President asked them, “if we hit first and some of our forces are
                        diminished, how do you provide for the second strike?” General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said individual commanders
                        duplicate strikes. General <persName corresp="#p_WLC1">White</persName>
                        explained to him there were second and third runs laid on all targets, and
                        that if the first run did not take off, the second run would get it. Also,
                        if the first run was successful, there were plans to divert the second run
                        to other targets.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if there were any limitations on the U.S. operating from
                        Japanese bases against the Soviet Union with atomic weapons. The Joint
                        Chiefs answered those questions. The President asked, if we decided to make
                        the first strike, could we eliminate the Soviet strikeback? The Joint Chiefs
                        answered no, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could strike back and
                        especially in the missile age it is becoming more and more difficult to
                        actually know where the targets are—that is, the Soviet Union
                        capabilities—and we couldn't possibly get them all. Their estimate was that
                        under any circumstances the Soviet Union could strike back hard.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if the Department of Defense, in analyzing the last
                        budget that was submitted, had discussed with them what, in the opinion of
                        the Chiefs, were the priorities—the first priorities—of items they would
                        want above the budget that was submitted. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> intercepted this with an
                        explanation of the four task forces in the Department of Defense<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d11fn3">Not further identified.</note> and that on the 10th of
                        February the Chiefs would be examining the results of the task forces
                        analysis of the budget and by the 20th would report to the President which
                        items would be needed in addition to the last budget, or what changes should
                        be made within the limitations of the last budget. (I believe that there was
                        a failure of communication on this point. The President did not get the
                        answer he was seeking, which was what, in the opinion of the Chiefs, should
                        they have had as first priority items above the last budget when it went in,
                        but maybe there was a deliberate lack of communication on this point.) The
                            <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0061"/>President indicated that perhaps
                        the Joint Chiefs might want to give him some ideas about this after they see
                        the February 10th paper and before the final Department of Defense paper
                        comes in.</p>
                    <p>The President mentioned guerrilla activities in Laos, the Congo and Viet-Nam
                        and asked what we are doing in each of the Services on this type of
                        training. He asked especially if the guerrilla activity which we are going
                        to face in the future on an intensified basis by the enemy couldn't have
                        some effect on our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> training efforts.
                        There was a long discussion on this point and the President said, “Maybe you
                        would like to give me a short memorandum on Viet-Nam, especially as far as
                        our guerrilla efforts in that area are concerned.”</p>
                    <p>The President then requested a memorandum on what the Services are doing on
                        guerrilla activity and training.<note n="4" xml:id="d11fn4">This request

                                >Clifton</persName> listed the detailed questions on guerrilla
                            training posed by the President after his reading of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName>'s memorandum. (Ibid.)</note> He
                        stated that there are 7,000 to 15,000 Communist guerrillas in South Viet-Nam
                        and yet we have no guerrillas in North Viet-Nam. He asked specifically how
                        many Americans are in guerrilla training. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> replied with a discussion of special
                        forces training, and the Joint Chiefs all promised to get him more data on
                        this subject. The President then asked how the special forces in Laos are
                        doing with the tribesmen.</p>
                    <p>The President also asked if we should do more about bringing more Laotians
                        out of Laos, training them and sending them back in. Are we doing enough in
                        this field?</p>
                    <p>The President said there is obviously going to be more guerrilla and
                        counter-guerrilla activity in Africa and Asia in the near future. He then
                        asked what plans they had to step up our own training and plans in those two
                        spheres, and asked if they had learned anything from the other nations on
                        this matter. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>
                        responded that we have studied the British experience in Malaya and the
                        French experience in Southeast Asia, and we have been training some <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> people, but, obviously, we are not doing
                        enough.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> then mentioned the
                        memorandum here on the airlift and sealift readiness posture of Laos and how
                        detailed it is. He said that he would turn it over to me for briefing. The
                        President indicated he wanted to be briefed on this subject and he asked
                        them if the memorandum gave him any information on the relative buildup from
                        North Viet-Nam over the roads that could be accomplished in the same thirty
                        days which he had asked for before. The Chiefs responded that there was
                        nothing like that in this report, and they thought it might not be
                        meaningful <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0062"/>because, obviously, they
                        could put a lot more Communists in there than we could get ourselves if they
                        so decided. The President emphasized again that he wanted their best opinion
                        on what the Viet-Namese could do in the same thirty days, and they promised
                        him a reply.</p>
                    <p>The next item was the B-52G, covered in a separate memorandum, attached.<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d11fn5">Not found attached; see <ref target="#d12"
                                >Document 12</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The President asked the Chiefs about the reenlistment rate, especially in
                            <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. All three Chiefs gave the President
                        a rundown on the reenlistment rate and emphasized that his “gold widow”
                        decision was going to be a help.</p>
                    <p>There then ensued a discussion of the efforts in the Services to hold down
                        the spending of American dollars by the Service people in lieu of having the
                        dependents refused the opportunity to go overseas. The President directed
                        that the Services take every measure possible to indoctrinate our people on
                        the importance of this matter, even though there was no good way of
                        measuring whether the men and their families were saving money or not.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> mentioned the U.S.
                        Savings Bond program and the Soldiers Deposits program as good steps to cut
                        down the amount of money. None of the Chiefs had any idea of restricting the
                        amount of funds that a man was paid in American currency. The President
                        reiterated that he hoped that they would take open and strong measures to
                        win the voluntary compliance with the spirit of this order so that he would
                        never again have to consider taking the dependents away from them.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>
                        about the water supply in Guantanamo. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
                            >Burke</persName> told him that we had a three-week water supply
                        available by shipping and that we could keep this up with some strain on the
                        logistics supply line.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the President directed that they give some attention to
                        guerrilla activities in relation to their future position in the Congo,
                        especially concerning training of intelligence teams and our advisory
                        groups, if and when they were to go in there.</p>
                    <p>After the meeting, General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>
                        expressed his concern with our having all these papers and the backup
                        material in considerable detail. I assured General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> that after I had briefed the
                        President, I would keep the papers around for two weeks and return them to
                        him, and I would not give them wide distribution around the staff because
                        they held so much rather planning type information.</p>

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff, in their meeting with the President today, told
                        him that the B-52G is being tested, but that they, on February 4th, resumed
                        the 12 sorties a day level of airborne alert.</p>
                    <p>They also told the President that the Defense Department goal is 1/8 of the
                        B-52 forces on continuous alert—that is the goal for this year.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that Secretary

                        the estimate of additional costs in men and money.</p>
                    <p>They assured the President that 1/3 of the total forces are on 15-minute
                        ground alert and emphasized that this is the major emphasis at this time for

                    <p>The Secretary welcomed the President to the staff meeting and invited him to
                        comment. The President expressed his appreciation to the Secretary and the
                        Under Secretaries for the work they were doing. He said that the positions
                        of the Assistant Secretaries, as well as those of <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32"
                            facs="0064"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName>, Mr.

                            >McCloy</persName> are extremely responsible and carry as much

                        areas of the world. The President desires a close relationship with the
                        Assistant Secretaries and he hoped that this was the first of many meetings
                        with them.</p>
                    <p>The President noted the report by the <persName corresp="#p_JHM1"

                            subcommittee, which was established in July 1959 with Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHM1">Henry M. Jackson</persName> of Washington as its
                            Chairman, includes hearings held and reports prepared during the Second
                            Session of the Eighty-Sixth Congress and the First Session of the
                            Eighty-Seventh. This reference is apparently to the section in <ref
                                target="frus1961-63v03">vol. 3</ref> entitled “The Secretary of
                            State and the National Security Process” (pp. 41-56), which had been
                            released on January 28.</note> and which emphasized the role of the
                        Department and the Secretary of State. The President said this report
                        reflects his point of view. The responsibility for political action in
                        crises falls squarely on the Secretary and on no other Department. The
                        President concluded by emphasizing again his belief that the jobs of the
                        Assistant Secretaries are essential in our Government.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the confidence of the President in the State
                        Department places even more responsibility on the officers of the Department
                        in the discharge of their functions.</p>

                    <p>On February 7, 1961, <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> carried a
                        story that asserted that studies made by the <persName>Kennedy</persName>
                        administration since inauguration day showed tentatively that no “missile
                        gap” existed in favor of the Soviet Union. On that day, the administration
                        termed this report inaccurate but would not comment on assertions that the
                        Times article and other similar accounts were based on a background briefing
                        by Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. In

                        vis-à-vis the Soviet Union.” He stated also: “I have emphasized that acting
                        on the President's instructions, we have already begun to move so that there
                        will be no such gap in the months ahead.” (<hi rend="italic">The New York

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> said that the <gloss

                        functions of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, such as
                        interdepartmental clearances and the implementation of decisions, would in
                        the future be supervised on a regional basis by the geographic bureaus. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> thought each bureau
                        should have a planning advisor. Also, an effort will be made to draw the

                    <p>The Secretary came in at this point.</p>
                    <p>The Under Secretary noted that the President is anxious for the State
                        Department to take the leadership in foreign affairs and it is up to us to
                        use our imagination and best thinking to contribute to this. It is up to the
                        State Department to be strong and to see to it that foreign policy is not
                        made on a fragmented basis by various agencies. Each Assistant Secretary
                        should arrange his schedule so that he has time to devote to planning
                        considerations and to achieve a perspective on our current activities.<note

                            security considerations prevail. In addition, the <gloss

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have now completed my initial
                        review of the Eisenhower Administration <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1961 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 budgets for the Department
                        of Defense. The attached memorandum explains the basis on which the review
                        has been made and summarizes the changes I am recommending for your
                        consideration. In reaching these recommendations, I have been aided in the
                        definition of national security objectives by the advice of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and members of your staff.
                        The proposed budget changes have been reviewed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                        whose individual opinions on specific recommendations are recorded in Annex
                            C.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">Not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>The task of thinking through the implications of national security objectives
                        for military force structure is a tremendously complex and necessarily a
                        continuing one. This review of the current budget has been able to deal with
                        only the most urgent and obvious problems. Existing analyses on some of the
                        central issues of general nuclear war made it possible to penetrate most
                        deeply into this area. However, here, as with limited war, much more study
                        is required, and will be undertaken as a matter of urgency before the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 budget is presented.</p>
                    <p>My recommendations relating to the expansion or contraction of our domestic
                        and foreign bases and installations are not included in this paper. A
                        separate report on this subject will be submitted approximately March
                            1.<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">Not further identified.</note> I believe
                        the report will indicate that such action as might be taken in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 to terminate operations at unneeded

                        <p>Detailed proposals are explained in the attachments under these three
                            headings.</p>
                        <p rend="center">National Security Objectives</p>
                        <p>Our review of the defense budget has focused on the adequacy of our
                            present and planned military forces to accomplish major national
                            security objectives. Task Forces were appointed in the areas of
                            Strategic and Continental Air Defense, Limited War, and Research and
                            Development to carry out this review and to examine the need for
                            additional forces in each of these areas.</p>
                        <p>The following are the national security objectives in terms of which we
                            believe the adequacy of our defenses should be examined:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Deter Deliberate Attack</hi></p>
                        <p>We must deter deliberate nuclear attack on the United States and our
                            major allies by making it clear to potential enemies that, in all
                            circumstances, such an attack would result in unacceptable losses to the
                            attacker. This deterrence depends critically upon our ability to strike
                            back after a direct Soviet attack designed to destroy our retaliatory
                            forces. It does not depend upon a pre-attack comparison of numbers of
                            missiles, or of forces in general, except in a most indirect way. We
                            must have survivable retaliatory power.</p>
                        <p>The reality of our power to strike back must be clear to the Communists,
                            to our allies, and to ourselves. The success of our deterrent should not
                            depend merely upon enemy caution in the face of uncertainties about our
                            retaliatory power. Such a dependence upon uncertainties could undermine
                            our resolve in time of crisis, and is dangerous because enemy leaders
                            may not be cautious.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Stability and Safety</hi></p>
                        <p>Also of great concern, and perhaps more likely, is the chance that war
                            could come in an irrational or unpremeditated fashion—possibly by the
                            mistaken triggering of alert forces, by miscalculation by one side of
                            the opponent's intentions, by irrational or pathological actions by
                            individuals, by spread and escalation of local wars, or by nuclear
                            attack by a minor power.</p>
                        <p>Our posture should be designed to avoid these dangers. This can be done
                            (1) by reducing the probability that individual triggering incidents can
                            occur, and (2) even more important, by reducing the probability that
                            such incidents would lead to war. Decisions, not incidents, cause war.
                            For this reason also we must avoid exposed strategic systems that depend
                            for their survival on quick decisions that might have to be made in
                            ambiguous circumstances.</p>
                        <p>We are therefore taking steps to reduce the dependence of our retaliatory
                            power on quick decisions. We want to reassure our allies and our <pb
                                n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0070"/>enemies that we do not need to
                            act hastily or preemptively in order to be able to retaliate. We must
                            not be forced in a crisis to take “crash” actions for the protection of
                            our forces that might be interpreted as evidence of impending
                            attack.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Improved War Outcome</hi></p>
                        <p>The conduct and outcome of a big nuclear war is worth caring about, more
                            than any war in history. The success of deterrence cannot be guaranteed.
                            If nuclear war comes and is unlimited and uncontrolled, it would be
                            suicidal. We must do what we can to prevent this disaster, to improve
                            the war's outcome, to terminate it under favorable military conditions,
                            and to limit damage to our allies and ourselves.</p>
                        <p>One of the most effective ways of limiting damage to this country if
                            nuclear war comes, although admittedly we cannot place great confidence
                            in it, is for us to use our nuclear force in a careful and
                            discriminating way. This may be a necessary condition for inducing the
                            enemy not to attack our civil society in wholesale fashion.</p>
                        <p>But for this strategy to be feasible, our forces must be well protected
                            not only against a sudden attack, but also against re-attack. A long
                            wartime endurance capability is necessary if we are to use our forces
                            with deliberation and discrimination. In short, our nuclear forces must
                            be controllable not only in peacetime, but in war. This means making the
                            command and control of our forces so well protected that we can maintain
                            responsiveness to Presidential authority.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this, we require a combination of active air defense, civil
                            defense, and the ability to attack vulnerable parts of the enemy's
                            military forces. The best balance among these at any particular time
                            will of course depend on the costs and effectiveness of each in the
                            light of choices made by the Sino-Soviet Bloc. We should maintain broad
                            flexibility to shift the emphasis of our strategy as conditions
                            change.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Reassure and Protect Major
                            Allies</hi></p>
                        <p>If we provide strategic capabilities that meet all the above objectives,
                            we shall satisfy an essential prerequisite for successful local defense
                            and diplomacy elsewhere in the world. In the case of our <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, we must have a strategy for
                            their protection in which they can have confidence. Our common strategy
                            must be one which is clearly in their interest as well as ours. The U.S.
                            must maintain substantial forces in Europe; we must also persuade our
                            allies of their responsibility to increase their own forces. Moreover,
                            an increased emphasis should be placed on non-nuclear capabilities.</p>

                        <p>In most other areas of the world, the main burden of local defense
                            against overt attack must be borne by indigenous forces, reinforced by

                            forces, some of which must be deployed in forward areas. This means
                            having a substantial airlift and sealift capacity and prestocked
                            overseas bases. The main responsibility against subversion and guerrilla
                            warfare must rest on indigenous populations and forces, but given the
                            great likelihood and seriousness of this threat, we must be prepared to
                            make a substantial contribution in the form of forces trained in this
                            type of warfare.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A Broadly Flexible Posture</hi></p>
                        <p>While it is implicit in the above objectives, a broadly flexible posture
                            that can serve us well in a wide range of contingencies deserves so much
                            emphasis as to be listed as a separate objective. We are not required to
                            make many decisions in the face of major uncertainties about future
                            enemy objectives and capabilities and about our own. These factors
                            interact to compound the uncertainty. In these circumstances, it is
                            essential that we adopt an insurance philosophy and hedge against
                            uncertainty by buying alternative future options for our military
                            capabilities. We must procure “lead time” reduction, making decisions
                            now to buy particular kinds of productive capability that we may never
                            use. We must start development programs in the full realization that,
                            because of changed and unforeseen circumstances, some may not be needed
                            by the time they are completed. We must try to design our posture so
                            that its effectiveness will not be seriously degraded by changes in
                            objectives or circumstances. Our recommended changes in the budget
                            reflect this philosophy.</p>

                                Defense</hi></p>
                        <p>In our review of the currently planned posture for general war, we have
                            found major vulnerabilities or deficiencies in the following areas:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Command and Control of Forces</hi></p>
                        <p>The chain of command from the President down to our strategic offensive
                            and defensive weapon systems is highly vulnerable in almost every link.
                            The destruction of about a dozen sites, most of which are soft, none of
                            which is adequately hardened, would deprive U.S. forces of all
                            high-level command and control. Moreover, the communications connecting
                            the various headquarters with each other and with the forces are soft,
                            concentrated, and highly vulnerable to missile attack.</p>
                        <p>Without the survival of at least some of these sites (including the one
                            containing the President, his successor, or designated replacement) with
                            their communications, there can be no authorized response in the event
                            of a nuclear attack on the U.S. Moreover, destruction of these sites
                            would deprive our forces of essential orders for self-protection and for
                            subsequent <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0072"/>conduct of the war, as
                            well as the order to execute retaliatory action. We should not count on
                            the enemy being deterred by the belief that some of our forces may
                            attack without authorization in the event our control is knocked out.
                            Moreover, the vulnerability of the U.S. high-level command undermines
                            the positive control system, making our forces both more accident prone
                            and less likely to respond when they should.</p>
                        <p>The programs we propose now are intended to provide simultaneously for
                            engineering development and an interim capability for survivable command
                            and control of forces. We intend in the future to emphasize the
                            development of command and control systems with greater endurance and
                            flexibility under conditions of thermonuclear attack.</p>
                        <p>However, these programs do not provide a high-confidence solution to the
                            problem of the survival of the President (or his successor or designated
                            replacement) in the face of a surprise missile attack. This problem
                            requires the urgent attention of the President and the National Security
                            Council.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Bomber Force</hi></p>
                        <p>Today our strategic deterrence is almost totally dependent on our bomber
                            force. This force is soft and concentrated on about 60 bases. Its
                            current mode of protection is warning and alert response. About
                            one-third of the bomber force is kept on a 15-minute ground alert. The
                            two-thirds of the bombers which are not on alert are completely
                            unprotected, except in periods of tension, or after strategic warning
                            has been received. However, both the programmed warning systems and the
                            decision-making part of the alert response are unreliable. Moreover,
                            this posture contributes to the kind of instability which it is one of
                            our objectives to avoid.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Active Bomber and Missile
                                Defenses</hi></p>
                        <p>The U.S. anti-bomber defense system is highly vulnerable to ballistic
                            missile attack. Its control is centralized in a few soft vulnerable
                                <gloss target="#t_SAGE1">SAGE</gloss> centers, without which the
                            operation of the system would be seriously degraded. The <gloss
                                target="#t_BOMARC1">BOMARC</gloss> missile is completely, and the
                            interceptors are almost completely, dependent on <gloss
                                target="#t_SAGE1">SAGE</gloss>. The destruction of the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAGE1">SAGE</gloss> centers would give enemy bombers
                            essentially a free ride over the U.S. to the hardened <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites. This would make it possible
                            for the enemy to destroy U.S. hardened <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss>'s with bombers when it cannot do so with missiles (if
                            the bombers arrive prior to the launching of the U.S. missiles).</p>
                        <p>Over the next few years we intend to reorient the anti-bomber component
                            of the air defense system. Changing circumstances will make the massive
                            bomber attack a less likely and less important threat than before.
                            Nevertheless, we do believe that we must continue to possess a defense
                            against attack by small numbers of bombers.</p>
                        <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0073"/>
                        <p>We do not now have, nor can we have until the late 1960's, if then, an
                            effective active defense against ballistic missiles. This is a serious
                            and undesirable deficiency. Moreover, the cost of the Nike-Zeus system,
                            the only system we can now expect to be able to deploy before 1970,
                            appears to be very high. A 70 battery program, which would protect about
                            40% of our population, would cost, all told, about $14 billion, possibly
                            more. Further, it is far from clear that the system would be effective
                            during the period when it could be operational, the late 1960's.
                            Therefore, we are recommending only a small expenditure on long lead
                            time production items in order to buy about a year during which to
                            reconsider this difficult problem.</p>
                        <p>However, our civil society does not need to be completely defenseless
                            against missile attack. In some circumstances we could drastically
                            reduce the casualties we would suffer in a thermonuclear war by a civil
                            defense program. Although protecting people in cities from the direct
                            blast, thermal and radiation effects would be extremely expensive and
                            uncertain in outcome, it may be neither in our interest nor the enemy's
                            to engage in wholesale city attack. And protection against fallout,
                            which could cause most of the casualties, does appear feasible. While
                            civil defense is not a Defense Department responsibility, the success of
                            many of our programs depends on some expansion in civil defense.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Missile Reliability</hi></p>
                        <p>The reliability of the U.S. strategic missile systems under operational
                            conditions is uncertain and may be less than anticipated. There has been
                            no systematic approach to a determination of missile reliability.
                            Additional test firings are required for both the determination and
                            improvement of missile system operational reliability.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Protected Missiles</hi></p>
                        <p>The retaliatory power of the United States is now very dependent on soft
                            or poorly protected bombers and missiles and will remain so for the next
                            year or two. It is very important that we bring this period to an end as
                            soon as possible. Therefore, we are recommending acceleration of the
                            Polaris program and authorization of construction of the industrial base
                            required to double Minuteman production should this later appear
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Inflexibility</hi></p>
                        <p>Perhaps our most fundamental weakness in the strategic area is the lack
                            of flexibility in our ability to respond. With a vulnerable strategic
                            force, with the expectation that the tempo of actions in nuclear war
                            would be incredibly fast, we have been forced into a single strategy for
                            retaliation. At the present time we have little ability to make
                            decisions in the event of an attack. Our forces might have to be
                            committed at a point when little is known of the extent of damage to our
                            military forces or civil society or the size of force the enemy has
                            left. The possibilities of a catastrophic <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42"
                                facs="0074"/>mistake loom large. Our response would be a reflex
                            action varying in scale only as determined by the size of our surviving
                            force. We must move as rapidly as possible not only to create the
                            survivable forces and control systems necessary to give us a range of
                            choice, but also to develop strategies at the highest level for a wide
                            range of general war contingencies.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">(2) Forces for Limited War</hi></p>
                        <p>The analysis of our capabilities for limited war reveals weaknesses in
                            the following areas:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Over-emphasis on General War in
                                Tactical Forces</hi></p>
                        <p>Our forces designed to fight overseas, those we would call on to fight in
                            limited conflict, are, in fact, strongly oriented in their war plans,
                            current capabilities, materiel procurement, and research and
                            development, towards general nuclear war. This is at the expense of
                            their ability to wage limited and especially non-nuclear war. Yet
                            because of their vulnerability these forces make only a modest
                            contribution to the deterrence of general nuclear war. And survival
                            abroad depends even more on fast and therefore risky decisions than
                            survival of forces in the U.S. The problems of stability with our
                            strategic forces discussed above are even more acute with nuclear forces
                            overseas. This is not to say that these forces have no contribution to
                            make to a big nuclear war. They can help. And because some ability to
                            deliver nuclear weapons from within a local theater could have important
                            tactical advantages (e.g., timeliness of delivery, choice of targets,
                            warhead yield) the ability to deliver nuclear weapons with limited war
                            forces should be retained. However, their major job lies elsewhere and
                            we should make sharper division of labor between long-range nuclear and
                            shorter range non-nuclear capabilities.</p>
                        <p>In concentrating on nuclear war, we have in recent years neglected our
                            ability to wage non-nuclear war and have severely limited our range of
                            policy choices. We cannot hope successfully to meet local Communist
                            aggression at all conceivable points. But we can raise the threshold of
                            our local non-nuclear defense capability, and reduce our dependence on
                            nuclear war, a type of warfare which it will increasingly be in our
                            interest to avoid. In sum, the primary mission of our overseas forces
                            should be made non-nuclear warfare.</p>

                            received an overwhelming proportion of our research effort. However,

                            development is recommended.</p>

                        <p>Our capacity to move forces in sizeable numbers on short notice and to be
                            able to support them is too small. The timely arrival of a modest U.S.
                            and Allied force to crisis areas could avoid the need for a much larger
                            commitment later. More sea and air transport is needed, but transport is
                            not enough. The prestocking of heavy matériel and fuel and the
                            availability of bases abroad is equally important and a greater effort
                            is recommended. Although some of the bases used by our strategic force
                            have lost most of their former value for general war, we and our Allies
                            will remain critically dependent on overseas bases for limited war, and
                            in some regions (Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Africa), more may be
                            needed.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Training and Readiness</hi></p>
                        <p>Many of our limited war forces are inadequately trained for non-nuclear
                            war. We need more large scale deployment exercises for all Services, but
                            especially joint Army-Air Force training in limited war operations.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Matériel</hi></p>
                        <p>Our principal deficiencies in materiel for limited war also stem from
                            focusing on nuclear capabilities. Most of the equipment is nominally
                            designed for dual nuclear and non-nuclear war but in many instances the
                            non-nuclear capabilities are small. This is notably true with our
                            tactical aircraft. In addition, some important new advances in
                            ammunition and bombs need much more vigorous development and
                            procurement. Here we can make a sizeable qualitative jump in our limited
                            war capabilities.</p>
                        <p>In general our recommendations are directed toward removal of current
                            dangerous inflexibilities and vulnerabilities in our posture. It is
                            imperative that adequate strategic retaliatory power be made secure.
                            Beyond this indispensable requirement, we seek a responsible, controlled
                            power of selective response that can appropriately meet a wide range of
                            possible threats. The recommended improvements will permit us to lessen
                            greatly our dangerous dependence upon blunt and indiscriminate <pb

                            so, to increase the force deployed by the end of Calendar Year 1964 by

                    <p>Some of the representatives of Time-Life Films, Inc. were taking pictures of
                        the President and they followed him into the room with their cameras and
                        microphones. While they were in the room, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> gave a brief report on the
                        meeting in Puerto Rico with the Latin American representatives of their
                        Armed Forces.<note n="1" xml:id="d18fn1">Not further identified.</note> In
                        connection with this (but later in the meeting), the President asked the
                        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to get a report from all Services on
                        the number of Latin American military personnel whom we educate in our
                        military schools in this country—by country, by service, and by school.</p>
                    <p>The President also instructed General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> to make an effort in the next few days to find out
                        how these military Latin Americans feel about Castro; from a military
                        viewpoint, what would they do from their countries to offset his regime; and
                        does Castro represent a threat to their countries? The President instructed
                        the Chiefs to do this quietly and unofficially. They assured him they could
                        get information of this kind within the next few days while our escort
                        officers are still with the Latin Americans.</p>

                    <p>The President indicated he wanted to take up two subjects: the guerrilla and
                        counter-guerrilla warfare, and the nuclear weapons. He mentioned the
                        Holifield Report,<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">Not further identified.</note>
                        indicating that he expected them to read it and be prepared to discuss it as
                        well as other facets of atomic weapons “command control.” [<hi rend="italic"
                            >2-½ lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>In the discussion on guerrilla and counter-guerrilla warfare, the President
                        asked several questions which General Decker and others answered:</p>
                    <p>How many are in training in the Special Forces of the Army? <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName>: 1100 at Fort Bragg, 346 in Germany,
                        364 in Okinawa.</p>
                    <p>How do we intend to use these forces—in what kind of war? <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName>: In all kinds of war—cold war,
                        limited war, and even in general war, if it occurred.</p>
                    <p>How many people in our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Viet-Nam are
                        skilled in guerrilla warfare operations? <persName corresp="#p_DGH1"
                            >Decker</persName>: There are three officers in the <gloss
                            target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Viet-Nam who include this kind of
                        training with their more general training. We had a team of 30, but the
                            <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chief had requests for the team to
                        pull out. Our program was based on training Vietnamese who, in turn, trained
                        others. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> made the point
                        that in some areas we don't have authority to train the military personnel
                        and we have to have the host government invite us to participate in this
                        training.</p>
                    <p>In response to questions, it was stated that we are putting 75 more people
                        into the Laotian training program. We have already trained 7000 Laotians.
                        Altogether, we have trained 14,000 people in the Southeast Asian area. We
                        now have a team with each of the 21 Laotian battalions. In addition, there
                        are 1200 Meo tribesmen in the hills who have been trained by our people.</p>
                    <p>The President asked General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName>'s
                        judgment, in line with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        speech, on what our course of action (as far as training is concerned)
                        should be in Iran and in Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>A general discussion then brought out the following points: That we now
                        respond, in the military assistance program, to country requests as to what
                        kind of training and what kind of equipment they want. The country requests
                        are screened thoroughly by the “country team” and then, back here, before we
                        furnish them the equipment or the training. It was stated that certainly
                        more emphasis can be given to guerrilla and counter-guerrilla training. We
                        can also examine our programs carefully to see that more light equipment is
                        put into the program—the kind that a man can carry with him. In regard to
                        equipment, General Decker pointed out that one of our most valuable
                        contributions is radio direction-finding equipment in order that guerrillas
                        can be located. Usually, guerrilla <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0082"
                        />teams have some sort of radio communication, and we can locate them
                        promptly if we have teams trained with this direction-finding equipment.
                        This is vital to counter-guerrilla operations because guerrillas are in
                        small groups and move so rapidly.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's questions, General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1"
                            >Decker</persName> showed him some pictures of our Special Forces and
                        described their organization. An “A” team has 12 men. “B” and “C” teams are
                        organized to control the “A” teams. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1"
                            >Decker</persName> finally estimated that we have approximately 100 “A”
                        teams in the three Special Force centers. The “A” teams include linguists,
                        communications, intelligence, and medical personnel. Their jobs are to train
                        anywhere up to 500 men each, and that the “B” and “C” teams then help
                        control the “A” teams and the trained guerrillas.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's questions, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> emphasized that the teams in Germany are essential; they
                        are aimed at the satellites in case of a war where guerrillas would be
                        trained to operate against Soviet lines of communication.</p>
                    <p>The President asked them to study carefully and give him some idea of whether
                        or not we could use more teams in South Viet-Nam—for training of men who can
                        be inserted in North Viet-Nam and operate as Vietnamese guerrillas, and in
                        South Viet-Nam as counter-guerrillas. He directed that they find out what
                        the South Vietnamese are doing about anti-guerrilla preparations in their
                        own country, and what they are doing in South Viet-Nam to infiltrate North
                        Viet-Nam. In this connection, he brought to their attention the Lansdale
                            Report.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">General <persName corresp="#p_LEG1"
                                >Lansdale</persName> reported on his January 2-14 trip to Vietnam in
                            a January 17 memorandum to Secretary of Defense Gates; see <ref
                                target="frus1961-63v01#d2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>,
                                1961-1963, vol. I, Document 2</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> pointed out that in the
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program an additional 20,000
                        strength was being considered for South Viet-Nam. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> added that approximately 6,000
                        of the 20,000 are to be used in this unconventional warfare approach. The
                        President asked General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> to get
                        in touch with the Military Assistance Group in Viet-Nam and find out, from
                        their viewpoint, what the situation is in regard to additional training.</p>
                    <p>The President brought up the subject of a rather large-scale Communist effort
                        in Ecuador and indications that Castro was probably the source of some of
                        this activity. He asked: “What are we doing to help Ecuador train and
                        prepare to offset this?”</p>
                    <p>Responses from the group brought out that the State Department has to
                        negotiate for additional people to be introduced into these countries.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> said that a first
                        “must” was to <hi rend="italic">teach</hi> the people counter-intelligence
                        operations; and secondly, then help them train their <pb n="51"
                            xml:id="pg_51" facs="0083"/>own forces in these matters. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> added that guerrilla and
                        counter-guerrilla operations have not been emphasized in our Latin American
                            <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> efforts.</p>
                    <p>The President then directed that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> make
                        “a sort of analysis” of what we can do <hi rend="italic">around the
                            world</hi> in building anti-guerrilla forces. He especially wanted
                        comments on each Latin American country. He pointed out that each year as we
                        go to Congress on military aid, he would get more support if we emphasized
                        this type of activity—“giving friendly nations the kind of military
                        assistance they are most likely to need.”</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLC1">White</persName> suggested that the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> take a look at our guidance to our
                        Military Assistance Advisory Groups in Latin America. In his discussion, he
                        cited Colombia.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the discussion of Castro in Cuba, and the opinions of the Latin
                        American military people whom they had just talked with, Admiral Burke said
                        that the consensus of the military was that their governments are really
                        moving too slowly in countering the Communist activities in Latin America.
                        The present governments, he said, are not too eager to go into this training
                        large-scale, because they are afraid of dissident groups in their own
                        countries rising up and taking over the government when they are
                        well-equipped and trained. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> commented that our engineer equipment had made a
                        considerable contribution to these countries in repairing roads, bridges,
                        and airfields—in effect, although it is not contemplated in our military
                        assistance, it is most helpful in improving the economies and communications
                        of the countries, and ultimately leads to stability. He commented that we
                        might review our military aid program to see that more of this kind of
                        material is usefully provided.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> commented that a great
                        deal of local pride is involved and we should emphasize items that help
                        their local prestige. For example, we are helping them build a naval academy
                        in Ecuador. Its cost is only $30,000. The Ecuadorans are doing most of the
                        work and are very pleased with this kind of contribution.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WLC1">White</persName> discussed what the
                        Communists are doing in these areas. He mentioned a small thermo-generator
                        being given wide distribution—a little generator that can light one single
                        lamp bulb or run a radio—and that the Communists are getting great credit
                        for this small physical improvement. He felt we could examine our own
                        efforts in this line.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> mentioned the school
                        that is opening in the Canal Zone in June for Latin American countries and
                        stated that we would see that the guerrilla and counter-guerrilla training
                        would be emphasized.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> mentioned that many
                        of our escort officers and briefers spoke in Spanish. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WLC1">White</persName> pointed out that the A-2, an Air <pb
                            n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0084"/>Force general, gave his whole
                        briefing in Spanish. The President asked if he mentioned Castro at all.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that he would
                        check on this.</p>
                    <p>It was at this point that the President asked them to take a reading on how
                        the Latin American military people felt about the Castro threat.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the President asked him for a
                        brief resume of their activities in this field. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> stated that the Marines had a
                        different approach to this problem: The Marines felt that we should be
                        allowed to go in and be guerrillas by direct action; that the Marines are
                        always ready to go in and blow up bridges and tear up the countryside and
                        then, if necessary, they can go into action to teach other guerrillas.
                        Fundamentally, he stated, the Marines don't want to train someone else. They
                        would rather go in and do the job themselves, and then take on indigenous
                        help and, finally, train them to do likewise. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> made it clear that the Marines have
                        no such mission of training other people, but that they would gladly do it
                        if so directed.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that it is not always possible for us to take
                        direct action and that, for most of the problems that face us now, we will
                        have to satisfy ourselves with training the people of these various
                        countries to do their own guerrilla and anti-guerrilla operations,
                        “realizing, of course, that this would disappoint the Marine Corps, but that
                        into each life, some disappointment must fall.”</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> then discussed the
                        force-reconnaissance company, the reconnaissance battalion in each division,
                        their missions and training. He pointed out that in the Philippines the
                        Marines have a radio that only exposes itself for 30 seconds to communicate
                        with other forces. He added that the Marines work very successfully with
                        submarines and can invade other areas without discovery. He explained the
                        language training of the Marines and that the linguists are added to the
                        force as the mission is assigned.</p>
                    <p>The President then mentioned that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                            >Thompson</persName> told him that it is his opinion that, in the
                        future, no Soviets will actually cross their own borders to enter into these
                        operations and, therefore, for the time being, we will have to prepare other
                        forces to protect themselves. The President added that we will have to do
                        more to help those countries (with whom we are associated) to do more for
                        themselves. He mentioned the threat that 15,000 men from North Viet-Nam will
                        be enough to overwhelm South Viet-Nam, and that Viet-Nam “will fall this
                        year.” The President felt that, if this threat had any basis of realization,
                        certainly we must face up to it promptly.</p>
                    <p>The President turned to a discussion of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss> meeting<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">Held in Bangkok March
                            27-29.</note> and what we should do about discussing guerrilla and
                        counter-guerrilla <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0085"/>training and
                        operations with our <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> friends. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> mentioned that Admiral
                        Felt is our representative and they would get an opinion from him on whether
                        or not we should encourage this discussion at the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss> meeting. He promised that he would give the President a
                        report on this subject very promptly.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> stated frankly that
                        some of our troubles came from the Ambassadors in these areas who head the
                        “country teams.” He felt that there is frequently resentment about the U.S.
                        team's military activities; that the Ambassadors generally want nothing
                        undercover going on in their areas—things that they cannot face publicly;
                        and that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> people then feel
                        suppressed and, finally lose heart and enthusiasm. Admiral <persName
                            corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> felt that we must change this. The
                        President then asked what can we do about <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss> in this connection. He stated that he would talk to
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and see if that would
                        be a channel which could interest the State Department in furthering this
                        effort. He pointed out that the Malayan example was a very successful one
                        and might be applied to some of our trouble spots. Again, he mentioned Cuba,
                        Viet-Nam, and possibly Iran.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> volunteered that
                        they might work out a joint State-Defense message to all Ambassadors to get
                        their reaction and thoughts—country by country—on this new approach. He also
                        volunteered that they would get a report from Iran in this field; and they
                        would hold discussion on what kind of proposals could be made at the <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> conference.</p>
                    <p>The President asked where this sort of training and activity was centered in
                        the Pentagon. General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName>
                        responded that it is handled in the Organization and Training Division of
                        Army Operations under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, and he has
                        recently appointed General Heintges, who has been in Laos for the last year
                        and a half, as the director of this activity in the Army staff.</p>
                    <p>The President then requested that they give him a report concerning Viet-Nam.
                        He wanted them to specifically indicate how many people we could and should
                        train and by what date these people could be effective. They were to
                        consider whether we should make a direct approach to Viet-Nam, or propose
                        this at a <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> conference.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of atomic weapons, there was a discussion of two major command
                        and control areas, including the Holifield Report, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> assured him that they were preparing
                        briefings on both subjects and would be asking him for time to present such
                        briefings.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked them to discuss Berlin—including the steps that the
                        East Germans and the Soviet Union might take, and what we should do to
                        counter them. Again, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> told him that
                        they would present to him a briefing of all our contingency plans, and urged
                        that this <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0086"/>be done rather soon so that
                        he would be prepared in his analysis of the Berlin problem.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked about the military situation in Laos and what our
                        next steps should be. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> reported that
                        the situation is now stable. They pointed out that the loyal government
                        would like to take Plaines des Jarres, but that it was pretty slow
                        going.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the presentation by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> on an increased budget for defense, he asked if it
                        was essential that we have an additional 13,000 personnel—“Can't we get them
                        elsewhere?”</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> outlined the personnel problems in
                        some detail, mentioning the needs in <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>,
                        and the Polaris crews; and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
                            >Burke</persName> outlined some of the steps the Navy is taking to meet
                        these new requirements. The new attack transport (ship) was discussed, and
                        the President was told why the World War II type transport was no longer
                        adequate. In addition, the strain on personnel caused by RB-47 wings,
                        missile commands, nuclear submarines, and support forces, were discussed.
                        The President inquired about the level of manning of the Marine divisions
                        and the use of reserves.</p>
                    <p>The final discussion led by the President was on intelligence and the
                        differences between the Army, the Air Force, and the Dulles conclusions
                        based on the same intelligence. He wanted to know on what basis these
                        differences arose. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>
                        responded with a discussion of the intelligence problem, pointing out that,
                        in the last analysis, the course of action, based on the intelligence
                        estimates, had to be a Presidential decision.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded the meeting by indicating that at the next session he
                        would like to discuss the atomic weapons problems that were scheduled for
                        this agenda. Mention was made of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                        >AEC</gloss>-Defense paper that was already being worked on with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>, but the Chiefs agreed that
                        they would prepare such briefings for the next meeting with the
                        President.</p>

                    <p>Because the President called off the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting last week and does not expect to have one this week, there may well
                        be a question to you—or to him on Wednesday—about his procedures in this
                            area.<note n="1" xml:id="d19fn1">No questions on the subject of this
                            guidance were asked at the President's news conference on March 1. See

                    <p>I think the best answer is the straight one: he is spending more time on
                        national security affairs than on any other class of problems and he is
                        meeting frequently with those most directly concerned with each specific
                        question. He finds this method on the whole more effective than frequent
                        scheduled meetings of the whole group, but he does expect to have formal
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings from time to time when it
                        seems appropriate.</p>
                    <p>A survey of the President's calendar for the first month indicates that he
                        met twice formally with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and fifteen
                        times with interdepartmental groups concerned with particular problems. In
                        addition, of course, he had frequent individual conferences with the
                        Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and other senior officials in
                        the national security area.</p>

                    <p>This joint memorandum of the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the
                        Bureau of the Budget summarizes the results and present status of further
                        reviews of the proposals for revising the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1961 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 Defense programs and budget
                        which were submitted to you by the Secretary of Defense with his memorandum
                        dated February 20, 1961.<note n="1" xml:id="d20fn1"><ref target="#d17"
                                >Document 17</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Attachment I lists the items and amounts on which there is currently
                        agreement between the Department of Defense and the Bureau of the Budget,
                        assuming that you approve the related policy recommendations of the
                        Department of Defense. The changes in the amounts from those appearing in
                        the attachments to the February 20, 1961, memorandum of the Secretary of
                        Defense result partly from refinements by Defense in the earlier estimates
                        and partly from adjustments recommended by the Bureau of the Budget and
                        concurred in by the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>We have agreed to defer any request for appropriations for an increase in
                        airborne alert over the amounts now included in the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1962 Budget. In lieu thereof we propose to rely on
                        continuation in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 of the present
                        legislative authority to incur a deficiency, if necessary, to support an
                        airborne alert. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 Budget now
                        includes funds for a 1/8 “on-the-shelf” air alert capability and 12 sorties
                        per day. Upon your determination at any time during the fiscal year that
                        further airborne alert action is necessary, the Defense Department could
                        provide for the alert on a deficiency basis. We estimate that the additional
                        cost involved in increasing the number of daily sorties from 12 to 30 should
                        be at the rate of $176 million per annum.</p>
                    <p>Attachment II lists the items and comments on which there is currently
                        disagreement between the Department of Defense and the Bureau of the Budget,
                        together with their respective recommendations.</p>
                    <p>The items covered in the attachments are limited to those contained in the
                        Department of Defense proposals of February 20, 1961, plus the Bureau of the
                        Budget proposal to cancel the last four Titan II squadrons <pb n="57"
                            xml:id="pg_57" facs="0089"/>which was also discussed with you at the
                        meeting on February 21, 1961. Several additional matters involving possible
                        further adjustments to the Defense <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962
                        budget will be treated separately. These include, among others, the impact
                        on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 budget of possible actions to
                        close installations, the possible additional fund requirements for retired
                        pay, repair of fire damage to the USS Constellation, cost increases for
                        Minuteman, and a classified project.</p>
                    <p>The specific amounts of the budget amendments required for each appropriation
                        account will be determined on the basis of your decisions with respect to
                        the program amounts shown in Attachments I and II and the items to be
                        treated separately. Except for a possible <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1961 supplemental for retired pay, all <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1961 requirements, including those indicated on Attachments I and II, are to
                        be financed from funds presently available pending the provision of
                        additional funds in the 1962 appropriations where necessary.</p>

                        <p>Assuming the 10 submarines are to be built, include $778 million
                            additional to provide funds on a “full funding” basis in accordance with
                            regular budgetary practices in the shipbuilding area. Defense
                            recommendation would definitely commit the Government to construction of
                            the 10 submarines. Proposed partial financing will probably be
                            criticized in Congress as a dodge to reduce the total amount of the 1962
                            budget amendment and would be an unfortunate precedent from a management
                            standpoint. The $778 million will have to be included in the 1963 budget
                            as an increased fund requirement without a corresponding increase in the
                            program.</p>

                            per se. However, this is primarily a fiscal policy matter for decision
                            by the President. Defense would not object if the decision was made to
                            include the additional funds in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>

                            missiles which would not come into the force until the third quarter of
                            1964, by which time the inventory of Polaris and Minuteman missiles will
                            be increasing rapidly, and an even greater increase in Minuteman
                            missiles could be accomplished under the flexibility provisions
                            recommended in the budget amendment.</p>

                        <p>It is suggested that the equivalent additional deterrent posture could be
                            achieved in this period, if necessary, with additional Minuteman
                            missiles in lieu of the last 4 Titan II squadrons and that the special
                            advantages of the Titan II missile (longer range and heavier warhead)
                            may be provided to a sufficient degree by the first 4 squadrons which,
                            under the proposal, would not be cancelled. It would be desirable not to
                            defer the decision since initial construction contracts have been let
                            and obligations through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 will be

                            for the 4 Titan squadrons. Further, the military requirements, as they
                            are determined from active studies now being made, may indicate a need
                            for missiles of large capabilities which cannot be filled by the

                        <p>Provide $82.8 million, the minimum first year funding, to provide

                            to permit accomplishment of the first Nike Zeus installations by about
                            October 1965 if all developmental, production, and installation
                            schedules are met. The intention is to provide flexibility, at a low

                            of the Nike Zeus system. A comprehensive review by the Office of the
                            Secretary of Defense clearly indicates that the minimum initial
                            requirement is $82.8 million rather than the previous provisional
                            estimate of $50.0 million for this purpose.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Budget Recommendation</hi></p>
                        <p>Defer provision of first year production funding at least to the 1963
                            budget. There appears to be general agreement (except for certain Army
                            and contractor representatives) that development has not yet progressed
                            to the point where the technical feasibility of the Zeus system has been
                            proven. A decision now to proceed with $82.8 million in 1962 entails
                            follow-on funding of about $550 million in 1963 for large-scale
                            production activities to preserve the possibility of meeting the October
                            1965 date.</p>
                        <p>A decision on the $550 million would have to be made in the 1963 budget
                            decision period this fall with very little additional developmental data
                            than is available right now—the key tests of the complete system do not
                            begin until the summer of 1962. Thus, instead of providing flexibility,
                            it appears that a decision to provide $82.8 million in 1962 virtually
                            commits us to large-scale production, and it would certainly be regarded
                            as doing so by the vocal advocates of Nike-Zeus.</p>
                        <p>Deferring first year production funding at least to the 1963 budget, as
                            recommended, would defer the large-scale $550 million funding decision
                            to the 1964 budget decision period in the fall of 1962, at which time
                            the results of the first full system tests should be available.</p>
                        <p>In view of the widespread doubts whether the Nike-Zeus system should ever
                            be deployed, because of practical operating problems, its own
                            vulnerability, and its very large cost in relation to the protection
                            received, deferral of the initial production decision appears warranted,
                            even if it means a delay of at least a year in the target date of
                            October 1965. Demonstration for psychological or prestige reasons of our
                            technical capability of intercepting an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss> would be accomplished by the present research and
                            development program without going into actual production.</p>

                        <p>The Department of Defense agrees with the position taken by the Bureau of
                            the Budget that the Nike Zeus development program involves many
                            uncertainties and, in common with other advanced weapon system
                            developments, such as the big missiles, constitutes a high risk program
                            with a chance of failure, but believes that it has the promise of
                            substantial pay-off in terms of deterrence and prestige, if
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>Provision in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 of $82.8 million does
                            not entail a follow-on funding decision of about $550 million in the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 budget unless, for good
                            reason, the capability to proceed with preparations for production is
                                <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0095"/>exercised early enough in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 to warrant such an amount of
                            follow-on funding in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 to preserve
                            the possibility of meeting the October 1965 date. Preservation of the
                            capability to proceed with preparations for production can, of course,
                            be misinterpreted, but it is the intention of the Department of Defense
                            to so manage this capability as to make such misinterpretation unlikely.
                            It does not necessarily follow that deferring the first year production
                            decision to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 budget would
                            defer the $550 million follow-on decision to the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1964 budget since the time frame of the sequence of
                            events in this program is not that rigid. Furthermore, it is expected
                            that the Nike Zeus program will continue to involve uncertainties even
                            after the test schedule is well underway, but this fact in itself is not
                            a compelling argument against the early provision of the capability to
                            proceed with preparations for production at the earliest time an
                            assessment of the relative risks involved would favor a decision to
                            advance.</p>

                            achieve a highly reliable satellite. The requirement is now known and
                            thus would not be an appropriate need to be met from the <gloss

                            compelling to the extent that any reassessment of national policy would
                            recognize the need to continue Advent.</p>

                        <p>The Department of Defense proposes to proceed at a reduced rate of $250
                            million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 with a development
                            program which will include 6 prototype aircraft and prototypes of
                            certain sub-systems to provide for the orderly demonstration of Mach 3
                            flight with an airframe potentially useful as a bomber. The intention is
                            to reserve an option later to develop a weapon system which could
                            provide a first operational wing about 1970.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Budget Recommendation</hi></p>
                        <p>Consider cancellation of entire program at this time in view of doubtful
                            need for an aircraft with the B-70 characteristics in addition to
                            expected missile capabilities during the period the B-70 would become
                            available and in view of the extremely high cost of the B-70 in relation
                            to the limited second strike capabilities that would be provided by such
                            a <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0097"/>vulnerable ground based system.
                            If a new strategic bomber beyond the B-52 and B-58 is needed,
                            consideration should be given to a less costly concept better adapted to
                            an airborne alert.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Defense Recommendation</hi></p>
                        <p>Since evidence is not conclusive it is not timely to decide either (a) to
                            proceed at this time with an all-out weapon system development program,
                            or (b) that there is to be no further step taken in manned strategic
                            bombers beyond the B-52 by terminating the B-70 program. Even though
                            there will be primary dependence on ballistic missiles for the strategic
                            mission in the future, there remains certain uncertainties with respect
                            to missiles including the question of reliability. There are certain
                            advantages inherent in a controlled force of manned bombers. Until full
                            confidence can be achieved in the missile force and until there is
                            conclusive evidence of the feasibility or lack of feasibility, based on
                            technical, military, economic and timing factors, of a Mach 3 bomber, it
                            is believed to be essential to explore this phase of flight to preserve
                            the option to advance towards a weapon system at the earliest time an
                            assessment of the relative risks involved should favor such
                            decision.</p>

                        <item>I think the President is right in thinking that the question of the
                            size of the military budget is important, but wrong in thinking that it
                            is <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0098"/>all-important. The net
                            increases in new obligational authority will be less than what many news
                            reports have been hinting: and the state of the country, the state of
                            the world, and the state of the Congressional mind persuade me that
                            there will not be great trouble on this point. The need for accelerating
                            our second generation deterrent force and the need for increased
                            capabilities in the area of limited war take up nearly all of this new
                            money, and I just don't think there is going to be any real opposition
                            to either course of action. Accordingly, I believe that the main thrust
                            of the budget message should be directed not at justification of these
                            relatively modest quantitative changes, but at the discussion of more
                            important underlying questions of military posture which are implied by
                            these first changes.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Most of the specific changes that are being made in the <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> budget justify themselves,
                            on common sense grounds, one at a time. It is an interesting tactical
                            question in each case whether the argument should be spelled out in
                            detail. My own hunch is that it may be better to reserve fire on the
                            more controversial items simply because there are so very many skilled
                            propagandists lurking in the wings of the Pentagon, industry and the
                            Hill. To give them exposed targets at this stage may be
                            dangerous.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Yet most of the changes can also be defended by more general
                            arguments, of which the most important are the need for flexibility of
                            all sorts, and the need for hard choices among hundreds of possible ways
                            of spending billions of dollars. It seems to me that both of these
                            propositions can be profitably developed at length. The need for
                            flexibility is quite varied: we need to be able to make sensible choices
                            in rapidly changing circumstances—this is the basic case for
                            strengthened command and control; we need to be free to move rapidly to
                            sharply different weapons systems—this is the case for investments in
                            development and in long lead-time items; we need to have a much more
                            varied set of capabilities—this is the case for guerrilla and
                            anti-guerrilla efforts and for research and development in the field of
                            conventional warfare. Each of these points can be spread around to a
                            number of additional items in the budget changes.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The argument about hard choices is the President's own, and I see no
                            need to gild the lily here. The initial submissions of the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff, the total figures of any one of half a dozen of the weapons
                            systems which are cheerfully proposed, the present tendency of each
                            service to think as if it were responsible for the whole of the national
                            defense, and many other elements are evident here. One quite subtle
                            point which may deserve some attention is that it is always important to
                            calculate the effect of our own plans upon the plans of the enemy. This
                            is where Nike-Zeus still seems to me to fall down badly, and it is also
                            where many advocates of the resumption of testing get into trouble—all
                            they can see is that <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0099"/>tests will
                            give us improved warheads; the consequences of the decision in other
                            fields, including the military, are not weighed in.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>So far I have been discussing relatively easy points. The really tough
                            question about this message, I think, is how far we want to go in
                            restating the basic military posture of the United States. This ties in,
                            of course, with the missile gap question.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>For argument, let me suggest that we do not want to discuss “the missile gap”
                        and that we do want to restate a military policy which will be somewhat
                        different from that currently enshrined in national security policy papers.
                        The phrase “missile gap” is now a genuinely misleading one, and I think the
                        President can safely say so. In earlier years it had the useful shorthand
                        effect of calling attention to the need for more rapid and attentive concern
                        with our basic military posture, but no one has ever supposed that a naked
                        count of missiles was in and of itself a sufficient basis for national
                        action. What we have to do, rather, is to be clear about our purposes and
                        then energetic and alert in finding the means to carry them out. The
                        President's language will have enormous effect within the government. There
                        is a whole theological framework here of words like “prevail” and “general
                        war” and so on which has led to a lot of war planning and even budgetary
                        planning of a seriously distorted kind. What I am suggesting is that the
                        President may find it easier to change all this by public language than by a
                        complex renewal of the theological argument within the government. The
                        problem is to find the fresh words, and the following notions are put
                        forward for discussion and not for definite acceptance.</p>
                    <p>The nut of what the President wants, as I understand it, can be described in
                        the following four requirements: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>That our military capability be such as to prevent any general
                                atomic aggression. Our own strength should protect us against such
                                an attack upon ourselves, and the strength which we share with our
                                allies should prevent any such attack upon them.</item>
                            <label>b.</label>
                            <item>That our ability to act effectively with conventional weapons in
                                situations which do not involve general atomic attack should be
                                substantially increased.</item>
                            <label>c.</label>
                            <item>That we should maintain the necessary strength, in all arms, to
                                take appropriate action, short of general strategic warfare, in the
                                event of a major aggression that cannot be thrown back by
                                conventional forces. (This is the hard one, but I think it cannot be
                                swept under the rug; the suggested language is cool and
                                unthreatening, as far as possible.)</item>
                            <label>d.</label>
                            <item>That in the terrible event of a general atomic war, we retain the
                                capability to act rationally to advance the national interest by
                                exerting pressure and offering choices to the enemy. (This one need
                                not be public at this stage.)</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>In addition to these general propositions, there are two limiting
                        propositions, one affirmative and one negative, which I think are greatly
                            <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0100"/>needed in our national policy,
                        and which can well be stated in public by the President. <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Negatively</hi>, we are not aiming to create
                                forces whose objective is a preventive or preemptive war, or any
                                other kind of massive first strike against another nation. This is
                                not the policy of the U. S. Government.</item>
                            <label>b.</label>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Affirmatively</hi>, we intend to see to it that
                                our military policy is fully consistent with our earnest commitment
                                to seek effective international understandings in the field of
                                limitation and control of armaments. (In a number of ways the
                                current budget does in fact observe this limitation, and they can be
                                spelled out if the connections are not too subtle and
                                sophisticated.)</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>If the President says these things, or anything like them, you will in fact
                        be rewriting basic military policy which came on to him from the <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration. This is in my
                        view a desirable result, but clearly it implies a decision which he should
                        make only after considering the alternatives. What I like about this notion
                        is that if the President says something of this sort, he will, I think, get
                        strong public support and we can then proceed quite painlessly to the
                        revision of the appropriate policy documents. If we do it the other way
                        around, by revising the policy documents first, we will get one of those
                        terrible guerrilla wars in which calculated leaks about our desire for
                        appeasement mess up the picture before we have a chance to paint it our own
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Finally, let me apologize for being so slow in producing this set of
                        comments, and let me also ask if I may have a look at the draft message.
                        Whatever the President says will become a part of our national security
                        policy, and while the above suggestions may not be useful or relevant, I
                        would like to get maximum mileage from whatever you do write; sometimes a
                        very small change in wording, because of the history of internal debate, can
                        be very helpful. For the same reasons—and especially if the message goes
                        into major questions of posture and policy, Bob McNamara will be as eager to
                        comment as I am.<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">In a March 14 memorandum to

                            large themes: 1) that the military policy of the administration was to
                            provide the United States with capacity to deter all forms of armed
                            aggression, at any level of force required by the national interest; and
                            2) the relation of this policy to the maintenance of peace and the

                    <p>On April 6, 1961, the Director of Central Intelligence circulated <gloss
                            target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-61, “Probable Intelligence Warning of
                        Soviet Attack on the US.” The estimate concluded: “Considering all the
                        factors affecting the problem of warning, we believe that in most
                        circumstances of an actual Soviet decision to attack at present or in the
                        near future, intelligence could give warning of increased Soviet readiness,
                        and could infer a possible intent to attack, perhaps a few days or more
                        before the attack. Warnings of a probable Soviet intent are likely to be
                        given, if at all, only a few hours before attack.”</p>
                    <p>In the next few years, there was little prospect for major improvement in the
                        “firmness or explicitness” of warning, because improvements in intelligence
                        technique would be offset by a decline in the number and accessibility of
                        military indicators as missiles gained in importance and general Soviet
                        readiness rose. Nonetheless, the “possibility of warning from physical
                        preparations” would not disappear. “Indeed, the limited time between initial
                        attack and potential retaliation would virtually force the Soviets to
                        undertake various preparations, including those for defense and
                        recuperation, prior to launching an attack.” In future, intelligence would
                        also have “to place additional reliance for warning on the more ambiguous
                        indicators not directly related to physical preparations.” In some cases,
                        “the first preliminary warning of possible Soviet attack might arise from a
                        judgment that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was about to take a
                        political initiative involving great risk of war with the US, or that a

                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to prepare for war.” (Central

                            <label>(1)</label>

                                    nuclear weapons but fear that State fails to recognize the
                                    deterrent value of conventional forces as well as their
                                    importance should deterrence fail.</p>
                                <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> also point out that
                                    nuclear retaliatory forces form a part of total force
                                    requirements. The degree of improvement which can be attained in
                                    nuclear retaliatory forces is thus limited by the total force
                                    requirements balanced against available resources. The <gloss

                                    in addition to the qualities of effectiveness, invulnerability,
                                    and reliability specified by State.</p>

                                    target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are in general agreement with the
                                desirability of “raising the threshold” before a decision has to be
                                made on the use of nuclear weapons. They point out, however, that
                                the level of this threshold is actually determined not by doctrine,
                                which has long required that no more force than necessary be
                                employed, but by existing conventional capabilities. The ceiling on
                                these capabilities, and thus the height of the “threshold”,
                                continues to be set by budgetary and manpower limitations. The
                                    <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> clearly envisage the
                                selective use of nuclear weapons in limited operations. State,
                                however, appears to be moving toward the prohibition of the use of
                                nuclear weapons in any limited war situation.</item>

                        war, the trend of our thinking has been made evident in the recommendations
                        we have made on revisions to the 1962 budget and in the accompanying

                                        general war. Requirements for limited war forces and

                            <item>In substance, our national strategy requires that limited war
                                operations be conducted with whatever weapons and forces are
                                required by the military and political exigencies involved in each
                                particular situation and by the national objectives to be attained.
                                In terms of nuclear or non-nuclear weapons, the requirements of each
                                of these contingencies are impossible to determine with precision in
                                advance. They can be determined only in the light of the particular
                                military and political context in which each has developed.
                                Situations may occur in which authorization for use of nuclear
                                weapons will be delayed, and there may be other contingencies which
                                do not warrant the use of nuclear weapons. An appropriate mix of
                                nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities for those of our forces which
                                might be involved will provide the United States with greater
                                political and diplomatic flexibility as well as greater battlefield
                                flexibility and capability for survival than if only one of these
                                capabilities is developed to the exclusion or neglect of the other.
                                Forces and delivery vehicles which might be used in limited war
                                should continue to have the capability of delivering either nuclear
                                or conventional weapons.</item>

                            <item>With respect to subparagraph 1 b above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                are of the opinion that while expected changes in the world
                                situation during the next 10 years certainly justify continuing
                                review of national strategy, there is nothing foreseen that will
                                justify abrogation of the principle that US forces must maintain a
                                dual nuclear and non-nuclear capability. It can be reasonably
                                anticipated that the trend in the future will be toward expansion
                                rather than contraction of the weaponry available for these actions,
                                as innovations in agents, weapon systems and techniques develop. For
                                example, a US capability to utilize advanced nonlethal
                                incapacitating agents in a limited conflict in the future might well
                                offer substantial military advantages within the limitations imposed
                                by delicate political considerations.</item>

                            responses and negotiating pauses in the event of thermonuclear attack.
                            We also agree that attempts at the present time to implement such a
                            doctrine, or to declare such an intent, would be premature and could
                            gravely weaken our deterrent posture.</item>

                        <item>The basic split in this report relates to the extent to which the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff should make a judgment now that implementing a
                            doctrine of controlled response and negotiating pauses in the event of
                            thermonuclear war is a desirable and feasible course of action in the
                            future.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>My personal judgment is that we do not now have adequate defenses, nor
                            are our nuclear retaliatory forces sufficiently invulnerable, to permit
                            us to risk withholding a substantial part of our effort, once a major
                            thermonuclear attack has been initiated. Furthermore, the advantages to
                            be achieved by limiting our responses, under such conditions, could only
                            be realized by the enforcement upon the Soviets of a degree of tacit
                            “cooperation” which does not now appear realistic. Nevertheless, I
                            believe that further specification of such a doctrine, insofar as it
                            applies to conditions of less than large-scale deliberate attack, would
                            be a desirable undertaking. It would submit the complex problems of
                            controlled responses, negotiating pauses, and their interrelationship
                            with enemy reactions to rigorous analysis. However, except for these
                            lower levels of attack, I believe that an attempt to spell out specific
                            controlled response options would be undesirable until we have more
                            knowledge of the technological possibility of creating the essential
                            building blocks on which safe implementation of the doctrine could be
                            based.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>It is my judgment, therefore, that it is not now possible to set forth
                            a more definitive doctrine, which if accepted in the proximate future
                            would permit, with safety, controlled response and negotiating pauses
                            covering the full range of the conceivable thermonuclear threat.
                            Nevertheless, I believe the matter to be of such importance that it can,
                            with profit, be examined further, with regard to its application under
                            conditions of less than large-scale deliberate attack and particularly
                            with respect to the conditions and the time-frame under which such a
                            doctrine might realistically be made increasingly applicable over a
                            wider range. Accordingly, I have directed the Joint Strategic Survey
                            Council, as a matter of priority, to examine the problem further from
                            this point of view and to submit their findings to the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff.</item>

                        <p>1. Reference is made to Item 2 of your memorandum, dated 8 March 1961,
                            requesting preparation of a “doctrine” which, if accepted, would permit
                            controlled response and <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0109"
                            />negotiating pauses in the event of thermonuclear attack.</p>
                        <p>2. Appendix A hereto is a study which considers the problem of a
                            “doctrine” as it would relate to the current situation; i.e., 1 April
                            1961, and to a future situation; i.e., mid-1960's. A possible doctrine
                            is contained in paragraphs 17 through 25 of Appendix A.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d25fn4">Not printed. This tentative doctrine emphasized that
                                the various elements of a controlled reponse strategy should be
                                phased in only as the United States attained capability to implement

                            Operational Plan and other US and Allied operational war plans. These
                            implementing plans are in consonance with current policies and doctrines
                            and are based upon guidance contained in the National Strategic

                            directives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These provide certain controls
                            relating to objectives and constraints and allow some flexibility in
                            timing and the selection of the major geographical areas against which
                            the response is to be directed. They do not, however, address directly
                            the type and degree of controlled response which are postulated in
                            recent studies and analyses conducted within and outside of the
                            Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>4. In the context of your request referred to in paragraph 1, the
                            attached doctrine, if accepted, would not permit controlled response and
                            negotiating pauses in the event of thermonuclear attack in the current
                            time period. The reasons for this judgment are discussed in paragraphs
                            9-12 of Appendix A. As further discussed in paragraphs 16 and 23 a of
                            Appendix A, attempts to implement a strategy including such options, or
                            declarations of such intent, would at the present time be premature and
                            could gravely weaken the current deterrent posture.</p>
                        <p>5. In light of the relative capabilities, limitations and objectives of
                            the United States and its Allies and of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and its satellites, there is no significant likelihood
                            of thermonuclear attack against the former which would be so executed
                            that it would be to the advantage of the United States and/or its Allies
                            in the current period to respond under a degree of control beyond that
                            provided in current policy, doctrines and strategic plans.</p>

                                Appendix B recommended “the desirability of moving as rapidly as

                                    xml:id="d27fn2">According to Section 1, this evaluation was done
                                    under the assumptions that only one large conventional
                                    commitment of forces at any one time was unlikely and that
                                    participation of more than 250,000-300,000 troops would reach
                                    the nuclear threshold and thereby “stem” the requirement for
                                    additional combat forces. Given these assumptions, the
                                    evaluation found that the United States had “substantial”
                                    capacity for waging non-nuclear war and that capacity for
                                    strategic mobility was satisfactory “except during the first
                                    10-30 days of a large-scale, rapidly-developing limited
                                    war.”</note></item>

                    <p>After a thorough review of the Services’ proposals, Mr. <persName

                            <persName>Connally</persName> and I have concluded that the 2.5 million
                        men in our Armed Services, equipped with 817 ships and over 30,000 aircraft,
                        backed by a highly trained Reserve force of 1.8 million men, an <gloss

                        $43.794 billion (including the Budget increase of $2,274 billion which you
                        proposed to the Congress), and the forces of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, and other allies, represent a military
                        force which is adequate for our purpose.</p>
                    <p>We believe that, with the exceptions noted below, a further increase in the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'62 Defense Department Budget is not
                        the answer to the problems which confront us.</p>
                    <p>The United States and her allies have developed strong military forces. These
                        have been successful in deterring the Sino-Soviet Bloc from overt attack,
                        but they have not effectively stopped the indirect aggression carried on by
                        the Communists in many parts of the world. Militarily, we are neither
                        organized nor oriented for the task of meeting and counteracting this type
                        of Soviet strategy. A substantial augmentation of our forces at this time
                        would provide us with no appreciable assurance that we could better combat
                        the indirect attacks which we face today.</p>
                    <p>It is apparent that new approaches to organizing and utilizing our military
                        power must be developed. We propose to place increased emphasis on this
                        subject during the coming year. Re-programming of funds within the existing
                        Budget should provide adequate financial support for whatever additional
                        para-military activities appear necessary.</p>
                    <p>There are only three major additions to the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                        >FY</gloss>'62 Budget which we wish to recommend at this time.</p>

                    <p>We talked about the draft paper on “Military and Related Aspects of Basic

                        of the paper was in his mind two-fold: The first and most important function
                        was internal in the Defense Department, and this was to change the whole
                        operational doctrine, and the thinking behind it, of the Military
                        Establishment from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> through the
                        operational commands. The present concept is based on “spasm war.” This was
                        reflected in all the planning documents such as <gloss target="#t_SIOP1"
                            >SIOP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JSCAP1">JSCAP</gloss>. In <persName

                            Ellsberg,<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">Apparent reference to Daniel
                            Ellsberg of the Rand Corporation, who served as a consultant in the

                        part of the report is), this is a ridiculous and unworkable notion. It is
                        therefore extremely important to move from the “spasm” notion to the notion
                        of controlled response over a period of time. Our general plan should be
                        flexible and include a large variety of controlled responses.</p>
                    <p>The second purpose of the document was to make the same point clear at the
                        level of the Secretary of Defense and the President. In addition, it was
                        also directed at providing some general rationale for this view. The
                        rationale is more important for the second purpose than for the first. It
                        was my impression that <persName corresp="#p_RHS2">Rowen</persName> was in
                        effect saying that the Department of Defense could not itself change the
                        views of the Services, a point which he illustrated with a number of
                        anecdotes, and that therefore the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and
                        the White House were needed to effect this change.</p>
                    <p>He appeared to accept my comment that the document in its present form seemed
                        rather without a clear political basis. It was his view that our comment
                        could most usefully be directed toward the political basis on which the
                        report should rest and its usefulness for White House purposes rather than
                        for internal educational purposes.</p>

                        <item>During the course of the past year or more, US intelligence has
                            acquired a considerable body of additional information pertaining to
                            Soviet programs for <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and other
                            ballistic missiles. This information, derived from a wide variety of
                            intelligence sources, has provided new insights into the general
                            characteristics and performance of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss>, the facilities required for its deployment as a
                            weapon system, and the timing of some of the Soviet activities critical
                            to the progress of this weapon system through research and development
                            into the deployment phase of the program.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>A major purpose of this Annex is to set forth the direct evidence
                            bearing on Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> development and
                            deployment, together with the alternative interpretations which we
                            believe can reasonably be assigned to various aspects of this evidence.
                            From this we seek to arrive at a general estimate of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force likely to exist in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at present and to set forth clearly
                            the uncertainties attached to any such estimate. The problem is more
                            difficult than that of estimating current Soviet strength in many other
                            forms of military power. Estimates of current bomber strengths, for
                            example, are based primarily on production and order-of-battle
                            information of good quantity and quality, which narrows the area of
                            uncertainty. Indirect evidence and insights drawn from Soviet military
                            thinking and weapon systems programming practices play a much larger
                            role in estimates of current Soviet missile strength.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Future estimates of many Soviet weapon programs are projected from a
                            reasonably firm current base; it is far more difficult to establish such
                            a base for Soviet ballistic missile programs. Moreover, the trends are
                            at best only dimly seen. The second major purpose of this Annex,
                            therefore, is to set forth the methodology for making an estimate of the
                            likely future range of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            capabilities, using the evidence as well as insights derived from
                            general considerations.</item>
                        <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0116"/>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>There are several reasons why considerable uncertainty should exist in
                            present US estimates of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            program, and why there should be a number of elements in the evidence
                            which permit differing judgments. Large ballistic missile systems are
                            new to both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and it
                            is natural that there should be uncertainty as to the precise problems
                            and lead-times involved in quantity deployment. Ballistic missile
                            systems require the development of new operational concepts, which are
                            not necessarily the same in the two countries; this limits the direct
                            applicability of analogies from US experience. Moreover, these weapon
                            systems are being developed and deployed in a period of vastly
                            accelerated technological change.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Another factor in the estimative program, worthy of special attention,
                            is the effect of Soviet security measures. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> has always regarded secrecy as a major military asset
                            in itself, and there is evidence that ballistic missile programs have
                            been cloaked with a very high degree of security. The secrecy goes
                            considerably beyond the dispersal and concealment of launching sites, a
                            practice which the Soviet leaders have stated is a part of their missile
                            deployment concept. Even routine aspects of the missile and space
                            programs have been assiduously concealed—place names like Kapustin Yar
                            and Tyuratam continue to be withheld, despite the common use of these
                            place names in the Western press. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> once publicly apologized for withholding the
                            names of Soviet missile and space experts who received awards, allegedly
                            because such recognition would make them the targets of Western
                            provocateurs. There is much evidence that the Soviets attempt to prevent
                            the observation of missile equipment in transit, by moving it at night,
                            harassing or rerouting Western observers, and other means. Finally, we
                            have recently discovered a special masking address system, apparently
                            designed to prevent the disclosure in personal telegraphic
                            communications of the places where missile personnel are
                            stationed.</item>

                        Evidence</hi></p>
                    <p>40. A review of other major Soviet military construction and deployment
                        programs (e.g., airfield construction and surface-to-air missile
                        deployment), shows that there is often a time lag of a year and sometimes as
                        much as two years between the start of a program and our acquisition of
                        sufficient information to determine its scale and pace. Some compensation
                        for this time lag is provided by the probability that work must begin at
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites some 18 months to two
                        years before they become an operational threat.</p>
                    <p>41. Considering the available evidence, our total collection capabilities,
                        and the time lags to be expected, a minimum of two to four <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites were probably under construction in
                        1957-1959 in areas suitable to deployment of 5,000 n.m. missiles (see
                        paragraphs 31-32). We believe <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0118"/>that
                        such sites are operational at the present time.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3"

                            missiles, nor do they believe that such sites are operational at the
                            present time. For a full statement of their position, see paragraphs
                            77-80. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> In addition, 7,000 n.m.
                        missiles can reach targets in the US from the Tyuratam rangehead, and it
                        must be recognized that in the event of war the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> could employ the launchers there operationally. With
                        respect to the other suspected locations in areas suitable to deployment of
                        7,000 n.m. missiles, some or all of these locations may not be <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites; on the other hand, there may be
                        such sites at locations which are unsuspected at present. There has been
                        insufficient time to establish a pattern, the areas are poorly covered, and
                        the security likely to be imposed by the Soviets is stringent.</p>
                    <p>42. From the foregoing examination of the direct evidence, it is possible to
                        derive a minimum number of operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        complexes which can be supported on reasonably good evidence. In addition,
                        the results of our search for operational deployment sites, taken together
                        with the other elements of direct evidence, contribute to sense of the
                        current tempo of the Soviet program. The relatively small number of
                        suspected areas and the identification of only a few masking addresses which
                        might be associated with <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment
                        are consistent with the deliberate pace of activities at the test range.
                        Further, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has a greater capacity to
                        produce and deploy ICBMs than we believe it has exercised. In sum, while the
                        direct evidence remains insufficient to establish with certainty the present
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength, it leads us to
                        believe that the deployment program thus far has proceeded at a deliberate
                        rather than an extremely urgent pace.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Soviet Programming Decisions</p>
                    <p>43. The year 1959 was probably a time of major Soviet decisions on military
                        policy. In several private conversations with Western officials in the
                        summer and fall of 1959, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                        referred to studies to determine what it would cost the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to build ballistic missile forces
                        sufficient to destroy the “vital centers” of the US and Europe.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d29fn4">The figure quoted by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> was 30 billion rubles. This amount is not
                            inconsistent with programs for several hundred long range ballistic
                            missile launchers and associated missiles. [Footnote in the source

                        precise numerical definition—they indicate, however, that <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had recently been engaged in the
                        planning of production and deployment programs. This was almost certainly
                        related to the planning for major reorganization of the Soviet military
                        establishment, announced in January 1960. Planning considerations in 1959
                        would have included the expectation of deployment with a 7,000 <pb n="87"
                            xml:id="pg_87" facs="0119"/>n.m. missile and a simplified deployment
                        concept, for which Tyuratam launch area “C” may have been the prototype.</p>
                    <p>44. The operational deployment program which we believe is now under way will
                        probably continue over the next two or three years. The scale and pace of
                        this program will probably be determined largely by: (a) the view of the
                        Soviet leaders regarding the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force
                        they require in this time period; (b) factors of efficiency in the
                        scheduling and expenditure of resources on the present weapon system in
                        relation to other military and economic programs; and (c) the Soviet
                        judgment of likely trends in their own and Western offensive and defensive
                        weapon systems. Given the rapidity of technological change and the heavy
                        emphasis on research and development in both the missile and antimissile
                        fields in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, it is likely that
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment programming beyond
                        the 1963-1964 period is highly tentative.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Pertinent Soviet Statements</hi></p>
                    <p>45. In persuading their own followers to accept the military reorganization
                        announced in January 1960, and in debating the Chinese Communists on
                        strategy and policy, the Soviet leaders have in the past year or so revealed
                        much of their thinking about modern weapon systems. The most pertinent of
                        these statements have been of three types. First, there have been Soviet
                        statements that the leadership seeks to achieve and maintain a superiority
                        over the West in weapon systems, but the Soviets appear to be stressing
                        their claim to a qualitative superiority in advanced weapon systems as much
                        as to a numerical advantage. Second, there have been a number of public and
                        private references to the potential employment of ballistic missiles against
                        what are termed “strategic” targets or “vital centers,” in contexts which
                        seem to include both military bases and other elements of national strength
                        such as industry, government, and population. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> and other Soviet leaders have spoken of the
                        desirability of achieving sufficient missile strength to attack these
                        objectives. Finally, in late 1960, <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> privately told important Bloc officials that 300
                        missiles were sufficient to “destroy” the US, while 200 were sufficient for
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>46. The foregoing statements about targeting are quite general, but they
                        parallel much previous Soviet commentary on the need to destroy an enemy's
                        power base as well as its striking forces in war. Military, industrial, and
                        population targets in Japan and the US were included in mock exercises by
                        Soviet missile and bomber units in the Far East in 1959 and 1960. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s reference to 300 missiles is
                        open to various interpretations—the figure may refer to operational missile
                        inventory or ready missiles in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, or
                        to missiles detonating in the vicinity of selected US targets. Nevertheless,
                        it confirms our previous assumption that the Soviet leaders had explored the
                        question of numerical requirements <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0120"
                        />for <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, and it indicates that
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> himself speaks of 300
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s as a formidable capability.<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">According to information recently received through

                            activity have commented on the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            program along the following lines: The Soviets are spending “millions”
                            of rubles on the program. If one success is achieved, it is magnified to
                            support a pretense that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            “hundreds” of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, in order to
                            impress the West. The implication that there are hundreds is only “idle

                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s economy and policy are “geared” for

                    <p>47. The Soviets appear to have decided, for the present and short-term future
                        at least, to maintain a mixed long range attack force and not to rely
                        exclusively on the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> for
                        inter-continental striking power. Bomber forces capable of delivering large
                        megatonnages are being maintained, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> is acquiring submarine-launched missile capabilities. The
                        present combined striking force has certain advantages in providing greater
                        flexibility in Soviet tactics and in complicating Western defensive
                        problems. In the light of these advantages, we consider it probable that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will for the foreseeable future
                        retain other intercontinental weapon systems to supplement their <gloss

                    <p>48. In planning the present and future size of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> force, the Soviet leaders have to weigh the advantages of
                        an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> weapon system as compared with
                        bombers, missile launching submarines, and other advanced weapon systems.
                        They have to consider the superior capabilities of the <gloss

                        related to the US retaliatory capability. They have to weigh these
                        advantages against such considerations as the ability of the heavy bomber to
                        deliver very heavy megatonnages against difficult targets and targets of
                        uncertain location, and the ability of the missile submarine to survive an
                        initial Western strike and deliver a subsequent retaliatory attack. Finally,
                        they have to consider the entire target system which their planners have
                        developed for attacking the US under the whole range of possible

                    <p>49. As our own approach to an appreciation of the military capabilities that
                        the Soviets might expect to achieve by building up their operational <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capabilities, we have computed the number
                        of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers the Soviets would
                        theoretically require for a single salvo designed to inflict severe damage
                        on various US targets. We have considered the following target systems:
                        fixed bomber and missile bases of the US nuclear striking forces; command
                        centers associated with control and communications for these and other
                        elements of US military strength; air <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0121"
                        />defense bases whose reduction by missile attack would improve the chances
                        of successful Soviet bomber missions; urban areas containing a large
                        proportion of US industry, population, and other resources of national
                        strength. We believe these are the sorts of target systems the Soviets would
                        have considered in evaluating their own <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> requirements for potential use in a broad variety of
                        circumstances and kinds of attack.</p>
                    <p>50. Theoretical computations of this sort are extremely sensitive to varying
                        assumptions regarding the Soviet view of the precise targets worth
                        attacking, the necessary or desirable amounts of damage to be inflicted, and
                        the degree of assurance of inflicting such damage to be sought. We have had
                        to use US criteria for these factors. Such computations are also sensitive
                        to variations in the accuracy and reliability of the Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system, about which there is a margin of
                        uncertainty in our estimates. In addition, computations involving an assumed
                        attack against fast-reaction retaliatory systems (i.e., the bomber and
                        missile bases) apply only to hypothetical circumstances in which the Soviet
                        force has achieved near-perfect surprise and simultaneity of attack. The
                        Soviets are capable of making more valid computations about their own weapon
                        system than we, but they too must be cautious about assessing in advance the
                        results of the first <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> salvo in human
                        history.</p>
                    <p>51. While computations of theoretical numerical requirements do not provide
                        any firm basis for estimating Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        force goals, they do provide a sense of proportion with respect to the
                        suitability of current and improved Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s for attacking various target systems. In very general
                        terms, we find that Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s are well
                        suited to attacking cities and relatively unprotected military targets,
                        including air and naval bases, soft and semihardened <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites, and soft and semihardened command
                        centers. Even with the improved performance projected for 1963-1965,
                        however, Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s do not appear to be
                        well suited to attacking an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force
                        deployed in very hard sites.</p>
                    <p>52. Applying these same computations to various hypothetical Soviet force
                        levels, we find—though with considerably less certainty—that under favorable
                        circumstances from their point of view, Soviet planners might expect to
                        achieve the following theoretical capabilities in a single <gloss

                    <p>53. As the period advances, the Soviets could expect to achieve higher levels
                        of assurance against the foregoing types of targets with fewer missiles,
                        because Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> performance will
                        probably improve while the number of such targets will remain relatively
                        unchanged. For example, in 1964-1965 and possibly as early as 1963, the
                        capabilities described in d above might be achieved with as few as 200-400
                        launchers. However, studies show that several thousand <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers would be required to provide
                        the Soviets with reasonable assurance of an ability to engage in
                        counterbattery fire against the combined total of hard <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites planned by the US for the period
                        beginning in 1963.</p>
                    <p>54. In evaluating the significance of various hypothetical numbers of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, Soviet planners would take into account
                        the likelihood that, for at least the next few years, the great
                        preponderance of US megatonnage would be bomber-borne. They would almost
                        certainly seek an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force large enough
                        to blunt or at least disrupt the US bomber capability before launch so that
                        their air defenses would have a reasonable chance of preventing large-scale
                        penetrations to Soviet target areas. However, they would also know that the
                        US is rapidly acquiring significant capabilities with mobile and hardened
                        missile forces, and that even at present the <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss> airborne alert and dispersal capability tends to offset a
                        Soviet ability to destroy air bases. Thus, the advance in US techniques for
                        the protection and security of its own striking forces obliges the Soviets
                        to recognize that—even should they build a very large <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force—they are confronted with a growing
                        segment of US retaliatory power which could not be eliminated in a first
                        strike by <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, even under the most
                        favorable circumstances.</p>
                    <p>55. The foregoing considerations do not, in themselves, define any particular
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force levels which the Soviets
                        think appropriate to their needs. They do, however, support a judgment that
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has strong incentives to build up
                        a substantial <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force, and that, at
                        least for present planning purposes, the Soviets would probably look upon
                        several hundred operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers
                        as a substantial force.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Effects of Technological Change</hi></p>
                    <p>56. The Soviets probably desire an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        force with a high salvo capability and high survivability, in order to have
                        a capability either to launch an initial attack or to retaliate against a
                        Western attack. The former can be approached by maintaining a high ratio of
                        launchers to missiles, although this will not fully overcome the problems of
                        fueling and <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0123"/>missile hold-times
                        inherent in the present Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system.
                        The latter can best be achieved for the present system by dispersing and
                        concealing operational launchers. Even with their very tight security
                        practices, however, the Soviets probably view the protection afforded by
                        concealment and dispersal as susceptible to deterioration with time,
                        especially in view of the reconnaissance satellite capabilities they would
                        expect the US to achieve in the next few years.</p>
                    <p>57. Many of the developments referred to in our other estimates, especially
                        the missile advances projected in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                        11-5-61, point to the period beginning around 1963 or 1964 as a time of
                        major technological change in Soviet weapon systems. Principal among the
                        advances which we can now foresee are initial operational capabilities with
                        a new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system, in about 1963 or after,
                        and at least limited deployment of an antimissile system designed for use
                        against <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s, in the period 1963-1966. There is a possibility that
                        test firings of a new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> have already
                        begun at Tyuratam. Intensive R&amp;D in antimissile defenses has been under
                        way in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for several years.</p>
                    <p>58. The new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system will probably be
                        designed to overcome disadvantages in the present system. It will probably
                        use either storable liquid or solid fuels and include compatible elements to
                        increase flexibility and decrease vulnerability in deployment. It will
                        probably be easier to deploy than the present system. Moreover, at that time
                        the oldest of the current Soviet heavy bombers will be approaching 10 years
                        in operational service. Although the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        has developed air-to-surface missiles for heavy bombers and could be
                        developing new bombers for intercontinental use to supplement its missile
                        capabilities, there is little evidence that the Soviets have made the amount
                        of progress necessary to avert obsolescence in this field. We estimate that
                        by 1963 the Soviets could also achieve a submerged-launching capability with
                        ballistic missiles in nuclear powered submarines. In the same time period,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could also have a long range,
                        ground-launched unmanned aerodynamic vehicle for reconnaissance or weapon
                        delivery. These and other developments could effectively supplement the
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force.</p>
                    <p>59. In 1963-1964, however, US forces will begin to include numerous hard
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites. We cannot exclude the
                        possibility that a new Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> could
                        achieve accuracies and reliabilities excellent enough to permit the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to contemplate counterbattery fire, but
                        it is extremely unlikely that such improved performance could be attained
                        before late in the decade. Even so, the fast reaction times of US systems
                        and increasing US strength in mobile missiles would probably preclude
                        effective counterbattery fire. The Soviets would probably decide that, in
                        these circumstances, it would be desirable to adopt additional measures such
                        as hardening for the protection of their own <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> forces, and also to develop more advanced offensive
                        techniques. Moreover, they would <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0124"
                        />probably regard the achievement of effective antimissile defenses as an
                        important element in solving their problem.</p>
                    <p>60. The potential effectiveness of Soviet antimissile defenses will therefore
                        be an extremely significant factor in their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> programming. Their antimissile R&amp;D is receiving very
                        heavy emphasis, but we do not know with any certainty when in the 1963-1966
                        period they will first deploy antimissile defenses, nor do we know how
                        effective the initial capability will be. If the initial system has only a
                        limited, interim capability, its significance would be primarily political
                        and psychological. However, if the Soviets conclude that their antimissile
                        system could provide reasonable assurance of coping with some substantial
                        portion of the Western ballistic missile capability, they would be strongly
                        motivated to commit extensive resources to its deployment, even, we believe,
                        to the extent of diverting resources which would otherwise be allocated to
                        offensive systems. This conclusion rests partly on the high priority
                        accorded to military defense in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        over the years, but also on our belief that in Soviet eyes the early
                        deployment of antimissile defenses would constitute a major technological
                        victory over the US.</p>

                    <p>61. In this concluding section of the Annex we present an estimate of
                        probable current and future Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        strength, based on the several interpretations we believe can validly be
                        drawn from the evidence and from appreciation of our own ability to acquire
                        such evidence. We again emphasize that the direct evidence is insufficient
                        to establish with certainty the scale and pace of the present Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment program. Our estimate
                        therefore also rests on the indirect evidence and other considerations
                        discussed in preceding sections, including the strategic ideas which we
                        believe govern Soviet military policy, the approximate levels of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength which the Soviet leadership
                        appears to be seeking, our general knowledge of Soviet military programming
                        practices, and our sense of the tempo at which the present program is being
                        conducted. For these reasons, our estimates of current and future Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capabilities are expressed as
                        ranges.</p>
                    <p>62. From the direct and indirect evidence at hand, we judge that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is building toward several hundred
                        operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers, to be acquired
                        as soon as practicable within the next few years. The commitment of
                        resources is probably quite large, but thus far the programming has
                        apparently been deliberate in pace. It is probably affected by a <pb n="93"
                            xml:id="pg_93" facs="0125"/>desire for efficiency in scheduling the
                        construction and activation of a number of launching complexes dispersed
                        over a wide geographic area. The production of missiles and training of
                        troops could be scheduled to fit into whatever site activation schedule was
                        deemed practicable.</p>
                    <p>63. In order to achieve such a goal, a continuing and well-coordinated
                        program of launcher activation would be required over a period of several
                        years. In determining the activation rates which the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could achieve after a buildup of a year
                        or two, we have taken into account the grouping of several pairs of
                        launchers into complexes, the tasks and problems involved in the preparation
                        of these complexes, and the time required to construct and activate them. We
                        believe that launcher activation rates of 50 to 100 per year would be
                        consistent with the sense of the current tempo of the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program which we have derived from the
                        direct and indirect evidence available.<note n="7" xml:id="d29fn7">The
                            Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of the Army, and
                            the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations (Intelligence), Department of
                            the Navy, do not concur that a launcher activation rate of 50 to 100 a
                            year can be supported “by the sense of the current tempo of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program.” They would, in the light of
                            the direct and indirect evidence available, be able to say only that
                            such a launcher activation rate is within Soviet gross capabilities.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Because it is impossible to
                        pinpoint the threshold of activity which our intelligence collection
                        resources would detect, we cannot exclude a present rate somewhat higher
                        than 100 per year.</p>
                    <p>64. Since it would require 18 to 24 months for launching complexes to be
                        brought to operational readiness, our judgment regarding present activation
                        rates bears most directly on <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        deployment at present and through the next year or two. Such activation
                        rates are not likely to remain constant; they are likely to vary
                        considerably within this approximate range from year to year, depending on
                        the configuration of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites and
                        areas of their deployment. Although we believe that the Soviets have
                        substantially passed through the learning period of the activation program,
                        as they gain additional experience it will be easier for them to increase
                        the rate. At the same time, other considerations such as a new <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, developments in their antimissile
                        program, and alternative uses of the resources involved will influence their
                        decisions as to the rate of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        activation. Taking these factors into account, we believe it reasonable to
                        project an average launcher activation rate of approximately 50 to 100 per
                        year during the period to 1963-1964.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Force Levels in Mid-1961</hi></p>
                    <p>65. We believe that the probable Soviet force level in mid-1961 is in the
                        range of 50-100 operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers,
                        together with the necessary operational missile inventories and trained
                        crews. This would probably involve the present existence of 10 to 15
                        operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> site-complexes. This
                        estimate should be regarded as a general approximation. <pb n="94"
                            xml:id="pg_94" facs="0126"/>The major bases for it are our sense of the
                        tempo of the program and our judgment as to the relationship between what
                        our evidence supports and what our coverage is likely to have missed. Such a
                        force level could have been acquired through either the smooth or phased
                        deployment programs which can be derived from interpretation of the test
                        range data.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Force Levels to 1963-1964</hi></p>
                    <p>66. While deployment to date has probably been deliberate in scale and pace,
                        we believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is now building a
                        substantial <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability. Soviet
                        planning for the next few years probably anticipates the advent in about
                        1963 or after of a new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system, and
                        deployment of the present system will probably taper off and then cease as a
                        buildup with the new system begins. This transition might affect the overall
                        rate at which deployment occurs; for example, the Soviets might decrease
                        this rate for the present system before the new one comes in, and then
                        accelerate it thereafter when the new system becomes ready for deployment.
                        Over the next few years, however, we believe that the launcher activation
                        rate will probably average some 50-100 per year, which would result in force
                        levels about as follows: 100-200 operational launchers in mid-1962, 150-300
                        in mid-1963, and 200-400 in mid-1964.<note n="8" xml:id="d29fn8">The
                            inventory of operational missiles associated with these numbers of

                            higher still. We have little evidence on the relationships actually
                            obtaining in the Soviet program. In general, however, we believe that
                            the following assumptions are reasonable: (a) to achieve a high salvo
                            capability, to simplify maintenance and logistics, and to have a modest
                            reserve of missiles for possible subsequent use, the Soviet <hi

                            operational launchers; (b) the operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss> inventory would also include missiles allocated to
                            operational units but not yet integrated into the complete weapon system
                            at deployment sites, in a pipeline equivalent to about two months’
                            production; (c) the cumulative total of <hi rend="italic">production
                                missiles</hi> would be about 50 percent larger than that required
                            for the foregoing operational purposes, with the remaining production
                            missiles allocated to such purposes as R&amp;D, training, static
                            testing, space program, etc. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                    <p>67. Soviet planning for this period probably anticipates the attainment in
                        about 1963 or after of a new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system
                        which will permit greater flexibility and less vulnerability in deployment.
                        Deployment of the present system will probably taper off and then cease as a
                        buildup with the new system begins. Some launchers for the new <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system may be operational in mid-1963,
                        and 100 or more may be operational a year later. If so, deployment rates for
                        the present system would almost certainly have begun to phase down before
                        1963. We therefore consider that 200-400 operational launchers remains the
                        best present estimate of the Soviet force in mid-1964.</p>

                    <p>68. The deployment program for this period may be significantly affected by
                        such developments as US acquisition of numerous hardened and mobile missiles
                        and other improved capabilities, and by Soviet development of antimissile
                        defenses. Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force goals for
                        1965-1966 could be enlarged considerably over the 1964 level in view of
                        these anticipated developments. On the other hand, these anticipated changes
                        on the attack-defense relationship may appear to the Soviet leaders to
                        warrant no increase in force goals or, more likely, only a moderate
                        increase. We are unable to predict what the Soviet judgment will be
                        regarding the interplay of these military factors, and there is a good
                        chance that the Soviet leaders themselves have not yet come to a definite

                            >USSR</gloss> could have in mid-1961 and that such a force could be as

                        level in mid-1961 is in the range of 75-125 operational launchers and will
                        increase to 150-300 in mid-1962 and 200-450 in mid-1963.</p>
                    <p>70. <hi rend="italic">Possible force levels</hi>. In his opinion, an <gloss
                            target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> on Soviet long range attack capabilities
                        should provide policymakers with an estimate of the largest <gloss

                            >USSR</gloss> could have deployed to date, based on an IOC of 1 January
                        1960 and assuming a vigorous deployment program. He regards such an estimate
                        of the possible mid-1961 force level as just as important as the estimate of
                        the probable current force level. Indeed, by making no explicit judgment
                        about the possible current force level, the Estimate renders a disservice to
                        the policymaker by encouraging him to consider only force levels within the
                        probable range and, at the same time, advising him (paragraph 42) that “the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has a greater capacity to produce
                        and deploy <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s than we believe it has
                        exercised.” The policymaker would not know, on the basis of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>, whether he can exclude all force levels
                        for mid-1961 beyond those slightly above the probable range or whether he
                        cannot exclude a force level substantially higher than the probable range.
                        Yet it is precisely this possible Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> strength which he needs to take into account in making
                        decisions bearing directly on US national security.</p>
                    <p>71. The Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, realizes
                        that an estimate of possible Soviet strength in any weapon system is less
                        essential when there is sufficient evidence to narrow the range of our
                        quantitative judgments. However, in the case of the ICBM, the <pb n="96"
                            xml:id="pg_96" facs="0128"/>available evidence is not sufficient to
                        establish current Soviet strength within reasonably narrow limits. The
                            <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> discussion and annexes acknowledge
                        that the evidence relating to <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        deployment can be interpreted in a variety of ways, that there are many
                        uncertainties in the analyses of such factors as Soviet force goals and
                        programming decisions, and that vast areas of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> are not covered or only poorly covered by US collection
                        efforts. Under such circumstances, it is essential to estimate the highest
                        force level that can be reconciled with the evidence and thereby indicate
                        the range of possibilities which cannot be excluded.</p>
                    <p>72. The view of the Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of
                        State, is that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could have as many
                        as 200 operational launchers in mid-1961. He emphasizes that an <gloss

                        likely than one half as large, but he believes that the chances are

                            <item>Missile production is not a limiting factor. Site activation rates
                                in excess of 100 launchers per year are within Soviet technical and
                                economic capabilities. In order to have 200 operational launchers by
                                mid-1961, it is not necessary to begin construction of operational
                                sites for the 5,000 n.m. missile before late 1957 or construction of
                                sites with more simplified launch pads before early 1960. Moreover,
                                construction times need not be shorter than 18-24 months and site
                                activation rates in excess of 100 launchers per year do not have to
                                be achieved in less than the time allowed for the initial buildup
                                period. In short, a deployment program resulting in 200 operational
                                launchers in mid-1961 can be carried out within the limits set by

                                    >ICBM</gloss> force of about 200 operational launchers is
                                believed to be the maximum practicable level which the <gloss

                    <p>73. During the next year or so the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        could increase its <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force much more
                        rapidly than in the past, since more simplified launch pads would be
                        constructed at new sites. With several years experience behind them, the
                        Soviets could achieve an activation rate of about 200 launchers per year by
                        early 1962 and an operational force of roughly 400 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s might be deployed by mid-1962. Thereafter deployment
                        could be accelerated if Soviet planners decide on a high <gloss

                    <p>74. <hi rend="italic">Probable force levels</hi>. The Director of
                        Intelligence and Research, Department of State, believes that the <hi

                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force is in the 75-125 range and that

                        200-450 in mid-1963. The higher figures for current strength reflect his
                        judgment that the pace of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        program is in fact more rapid than the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                        implies; the higher figures for future strength are based on his judgment
                        that a site activation rate of 150-175 launchers per year should be used in
                        projecting the upper limit of the probable program. Underlying both
                        judgments is his estimate that Soviet leaders seek to acquire a force of
                        several hundred operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers
                        before the US has a large number of hardened sites and mobile long range
                        missiles. The Soviet deployment program, consequently, is likely to be
                        pursued at a fairly rapid pace in the next year or two.</p>
                    <p>75. It is recognized that the additional <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s estimated for mid-1961 would not materially increase
                        current Soviet long range attack capabilities. However, a force of about 300
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s around mid-1962 would enable the

                        alternatively, to have moderate assurance of inflicting severe damage to
                        command-control centers, air defense bases, and missile-launching submarine
                        bases, as well as <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> operational
                        installations. This capability would be achieved approximately one year
                        sooner than is possible with the maximum <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> force as estimated in the <gloss target="#t_NIE1"
                            >NIE</gloss> text. In particular, it would be achieved before the number

                        to increase sharply.</p>
                    <p>76. Whether deployment thereafter will continue at a rapid rate or level off
                        depends on such factors as Soviet success in developing a new <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system and antimissile defenses, their
                        assessment of US retaliatory capabilities in the post-1963 period, and the
                        extent to which Soviet <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0130"/>leaders become
                        convinced that very high <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force goals
                        are necessary or desirable. If Soviet leaders decide to build toward an
                        effective <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability against large
                        numbers of US missiles in hardened sites or to achieve a substantial <gloss

                        the decade, then the Soviet deployment program would be accelerated.
                        However, there is at least an equal chance that <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> deployment will taper off sometime in 1963 since Soviet
                        planners might consider it more advantageous to accelerate their antimissile
                        defense program. In that case, an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        force of 300-500 operational launchers would be maintained in the 1964-1966

                        required site design and decision to deploy prior to the first Soviet firing

                    <p>79. The Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of the Army,
                        and the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations (Intelligence), Department of
                        the Navy, believe that the evidence available on the Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> development program is sufficiently
                        complete and valid to support the conclusion that little, if any, <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment has occurred, and that the
                        near absence of evidence of deployment strengthens that conclusion.</p>
                    <p>80. On the basis of all the evidence and the reasoning outlined above, the
                        Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of the Army, and the
                        Assistant Chief of Naval Operations (Intelligence), Department of the Navy,
                        estimate “a few” operational Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        launchers for mid-1961. Although they do not consider the evidence
                        sufficient to project a precise estimate of the Soviet planning for future
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength, they accept the

                            >USAF</gloss></p>
                    <p>81. The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                            >USAF</gloss>, does not concur with the judgments reached herein on the
                        nature of the current and future Soviet force goals or the strategic
                        considerations which determine their magnitude. In his view the estimate of
                        current force levels does not accurately represent the scope of deployment
                        indicated by the nature and quality of the evidence thus far accumulated,
                        but reflects instead the impact of the extreme security measures which have
                        obscured the broad scope of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        program from its inception. In addition, he believes that proper allowance
                        has not been made in the estimate for the lack of intelligence coverage of
                        the many areas in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in which <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment may have been carried out.</p>
                    <p>82. The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                            >USAF</gloss>, believes that the Soviet determination to achieve world
                        domination has fostered recognition of the fact that the ultimate
                        elimination of the US, as the chief obstacle to the achievement of their
                        objective, cannot be accomplished without a clear preponderance of military
                        capability. Moreover, Soviet doctrine and deeds suggest to him that the
                        Soviet hierarchy are mindful of the fact that few, if any, lasting major
                        political victories in history have been achieved without the supporting
                        bulwark of superior military power.</p>
                    <p>83. The history of their ballistic missile program testifies to an early
                        recognition by the Soviets of the unprecedented potential offered by such
                        weapons and reflects their determination to exploit the potential by making
                        ballistic missiles the dominant system in their strategic strike force.
                        Their highly successful <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> testing record
                        reflects the qualitative achievement of their well-planned, well-organized
                        program which would facilitate the realization of predetermined force goals
                        of any reasonable magnitude. Soviet efforts to mask their program in secrecy
                        indicate the importance which they attach to their growing missile
                        capability. Moreover, evidence developed in spite of their security measures
                        reveals programming for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>] deployment concurrent with the testing phase of
                        their program. This concurrency is a further indication of Soviet
                        determination to maximize their operational capability at the earliest
                        practicable time. In this connection, the evidence on deployment is
                        consistent with the estimate that the Soviets achieved <pb n="101"
                            xml:id="pg_101" facs="0133"/>their initial operational capability by 1
                        January 1960, and in the intervening period of a year and a half, to
                        mid-1961, brought to operational readiness at least 120 and possibly an ever
                        greater number of operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        launchers.</p>
                    <p>84. Considering the emphasis which the Soviets place on secrecy, and the
                        absence of other than partial intelligence coverage on most of the areas
                        most suitable for <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment, we could
                        not expect to identify more than a small portion of the Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment program. Nevertheless the
                        Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                            >USAF</gloss>, has identified at least six areas on which there is
                        reasonably good evidence of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        deployment. Within these areas he believes there are between 10 and 15
                        operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> site-complexes. Further,
                        he has about 20 additional areas under active consideration on which
                        evidence indicates the possibility of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        launch site construction. Considering the economics of logistic support and
                        specialized maintenance and control problems, the siting of several site
                        complexes in a deployment area is highly probable and should be expected.
                        Therefore, deployment—whether actual or planned—represented by the 20
                        additional areas—reflects the existence of a program of considerable
                        magnitude. Even though identification of some of the suspect areas should
                        later prove erroneous, undoubtedly others will be identified to replace them
                        as the delay in intelligence reporting catches up with the actual
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>85. In view of the above, the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss

                                    parts. Sections E, F, H, and N (corresponding to pages 4-6,
                                    6-12, 14-22, and 30, respectively, of the shorter document)
                                    contain a basic revision of military policy and doctrine for
                                    both general and local war. Their substantive content deals with
                                    problems that are primarily military in content and that fall
                                        <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0135"/>within the
                                    operating responsibility of the Defense Department. The other
                                    sections deal with a wide variety of problems ranging from a
                                    statement of basic national objectives to alliances and civil
                                    defense to arms reduction. These problems are less narrowly
                                    military, and they involve the operating responsibilities of the
                                    State Department and in some cases other Departments, as well as
                                    those of the Defense Department. Further, the statement of a new
                                    national policy with respect to many of them involves the
                                    resolution of political problems which are not explicitly faced
                                    in the present draft.</p>
                                <p>For these reasons, and also because of the importance we attach
                                    to restating our military doctrine as soon as feasible, we
                                    suggest that the scope of the document be substantially narrowed
                                    to encompass just those issues dealt with in the central
                                    paragraphs listed above. When so narrowed, it could take the

                                        >BNSP</gloss>, which would be followed by other amendments

                            <item><p>The new views on central war contain two important components.
                                    The first is the proposition that our initial recognition of the
                                    outbreak of central war should not result in a spasm in which we
                                    fire off everything we can in the way of strategic weapons.
                                    Rather, we should substitute a doctrine of controlled response,
                                    which emphasizes the maintenance of some reserve strategic
                                    nuclear striking capacity, and which has as its goal the
                                    limitation of damage and the avoidance of a situation in which
                                    we are inferior in military strength after the first exchange.
                                    For the single goal of “prevailing” in central war, the new
                                    doctrine substitutes a spectrum of possible goals running from
                                    superiority to stalemate, the appropriate one of which is to be
                                    sought in the light of the situation at the time.</p>
                                <p>We agree on the importance of this change, and the associated
                                    changes in the mechanism of command and control which are
                                    necessary to put it into practice.</p></item>

                            <item>The second component of the discussion of general war is the
                                explicit introduction of second-strike counterforce
                                (countermilitary) capability as an objective to be achieved by our
                                striking force.<note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4">The most explicit
                                    reference to counterforce in the draft paper reads: “Offensive
                                    countermilitary attack capabilities, active defenses and passive
                                    defenses, supported by warning and reconnaissance systems,
                                    should be able to reduce enemy residual military capability at
                                    least to levels that will avoid the strategic inferiority of
                                    U.S. residual forces, and if consistent with other U.S. wartime
                                    objectives, give the U.S. a strategic superiority.”</note> The
                                paper does not seem entirely clear on just what scope is to be given
                                to this objective. On the one hand, it seems clear that a flexible
                                capability for second strike response would include some capacity
                                for hitting military targets, unless the forces were deliberately
                                designed to preclude this, in terms of accuracy, etc. In this sense,
                                stating counterforce capability as an objective adds nothing that is
                                not already implied by the doctrine of flexible <pb n="104"
                                    xml:id="pg_104" facs="0136"/>response. On the other hand, the
                                inclusion of this capability does represent a significant change
                                from the present doctrine of deterrence. Once we move from that
                                doctrine, we raise the host of problems attendant on the interaction
                                of our decisions with those of the Soviet Union. If we try to
                                increase our second-strike counterforce capability, and by so doing,
                                stimulate them to do the same, are we in fact adding to our
                                security? The draft perhaps deals with this problem by implication,
                                in terms of budget constraints at the present level. It has been
                                argued that counterforce capability that covers more than a part of
                                the enemy's striking power is at best a transient achievement. Enemy
                                response to our own buildup, plus the real intelligence problems of
                                targetting the force of the other side, make it unclear as to just
                                how much counterforce capability we have at any time and thus, since
                                we cannot really rely on it in choosing our actions, an attempt to
                                build it into our strategy may be dangerous, as well as wasteful. In
                                our judgment, the consequences of the explicit introduction of
                                counterforce capability should be dealt with more directly, and the
                                desired scope of this capability stated more clearly.</item>

                            <item><p>The draft proposes that, in local war, we place main, but not
                                    sole reliance on non-nuclear weapons. With this we are in hearty
                                    agreement. But there are two aspects of this proposition that
                                    are unclear. First, the present transition point from
                                    conventional to nuclear response—namely, any war involving more
                                    than 300-350 thousand troops—is accepted without discussion. We
                                    think this point deserves explicit explanation, including the
                                    consideration of how desirable it would be to have a larger
                                    conventional capability in order to make possible a higher
                                    transition point. Similarly, a more explicit treatment of the
                                    feasibility of local nuclear war is desirable. At least the
                                    alternative of mobilizing more non-nuclear forces might be
                                    brought in.</p>
                                <p>At present, the draft makes no explicit geographic references in
                                    its discussion of local war. It would be better to make explicit
                                    that it does not deal with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> area, and refer to the recent <gloss

                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>The present draft follows the traditional style of <gloss
                                    target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> papers. This style, with its
                                heavy reliance on abstract and somewhat dogmatic statement, may be
                                dictated by the nature of the task. The added explanatory section is
                                a commendable innovation. It could perhaps be carried further by
                                modifying it in two ways. First, another annex is needed which
                                indicates in concrete and, where possible, quantitative, terms how
                                far our present force position is from achieving the desired
                                capabilities, and what would have to be done to go the whole way.
                                Second, the basic explanatory material might be treated as a sort of
                                “legislative history,” which provides various examples of how the
                                doctrines would apply in <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0137"

                                        the impression that “our security policy contemplates two
                                        entirely separate and distinct sets of forces” for limited
                                        and general war, that a precise distinction could not be
                                        made between local and general war, and that national
                                        security policy should be able to deal with China and the
                                        Soviet Union as separate entities as well as a common

                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> FOR DEALING WITH INTERNATIONAL MATTERS</p>
                    <p>The President's staff is at present about two-thirds of the way toward a
                        sound and durable organization for his work in international affairs. Since
                        January a number of steps have been taken, and in the same period the
                        President's concept of what he wants has developed somewhat. There is still
                        unfinished business.</p>
                    <p>The rules of this operation, as we see them, are four: <list>
                            <item>First: The President's staff must not attempt to replace the
                                President's chief constitutional and statutory advisers.</item>
                            <item>Second: The President's staff is to serve as an extension of
                                himself—as his eyes and ears and his source of nondepartmental
                                comment. The President's staff is his own instrument. It is
                                not—though this is a hard rule—a place for men trying to peddle
                                their own remedies without Presidential backing.</item>
                            <item>Third: The President's staff must see to it that all great issues
                                are adequately controlled and coordinated. This does not mean that
                                control and <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0138"/>coordination
                                should necessarily be managed through this staff, but rather that
                                when there is weakness the White House group must spot it early and
                                stimulate remedial action—either through efforts with those directly
                                responsible or by reference up the line, to the President if
                                necessary.</item>
                            <item>Fourth: The President's staff must be a center of initiative and
                                energy in the planning process. It is an abiding weakness of
                                this—and of every democratic government—that it tends to react to
                                crises. We have sought to correct this weakness by organizing the
                                planning process in Washington: isolating foreseeable problems and
                                areas of opportunity; arranging for the assignment of responsibility
                                for initiating planning papers; reviewing the papers as they come
                                forward; gearing the intelligence process to the town's planning
                                schedule. Centered about the Tuesday Planning lunch, all of this has
                                moved forward in good order and is reflected in the attached
                                planning schedule.<note n="1" xml:id="d31fn1">Not found
                                    attached.</note></item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The staff near the President, as it stood in January, 1961, was a complex
                        affair. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had within
                        the White House staff six men with distinct and significant responsibilities
                        in foreign affairs: Gray, <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1"
                        >Goodpaster</persName>, Harr, Kistiakowsky, Randall and Persons. But across
                        the street in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> he had a multitude:
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff and the staff of <gloss
                            target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> has changed all
                        that. He abolished the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>; his men have cut
                        back the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff. On the other hand, he
                        has used for specific foreign problems several of his immediate White House
                        staff. He has not wished to give clear authority to any one of these men
                        over another, preferring to retain the right of direct communication and
                        command with such men as <persName corresp="#p_SAMJ1"
                        >Schlesinger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DRA1">Dungan</persName>,
                        Goodwin, <persName corresp="#p_STC3">Sorensen</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_CCV1"
                            >Clifton</persName>—in addition to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                            >Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, who
                        hold formal appointments in this area, and <persName corresp="#p_MCJJ1"
                            >McCloy</persName>, McGovern, Berle, and <persName corresp="#p_ADG2"
                            >Acheson</persName>, each of whom has some special relation to the White
                        House. There is also the Vice President, a highly valuable agent, but
                        obviously one with direct access; and members of the Administration who are
                        particularly close to the President, by blood or friendship, have channels
                        of their own.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, though the President works through many people and talks to
                            still more, he retains an acute sense of “operational” communication;
                            thus he seldom gives an assignment to an inappropriate receiver; he
                            expects his staff to get his ideas into sensible channels; he counts on
                            his people to keep in close touch with each other, and in general they
                            do. His own plain sense of the matter is that the White House must be
                            the center of both final authority and initiatives, but that the great
                            roles of the State and Defense Secretaries must never be undermined. It
                            is within these standards that his agents work.</item>

                        <item>Second, after some months of effort and much resistance in all
                            agencies, the White House now has sure and rapid access to all important
                            messages, and they all come in to one place (or nearly all—end-running
                            is endemic). This puts Mr. <persName>Kennedy</persName> and his people
                            where none of his predecessors have been. It is the cable and despatch
                            traffic, above and beyond anything else, that gives the immediate flavor
                            of the daily world and shows the President and his people where to look
                            further and where to intervene.</item>
                        <item><p>Third, although many men have direct access to the President, they
                                have learned, in very large measure, to keep in close touch with one
                                another, and to see to it that their work is coordinated. The White
                                House very rarely speaks with two voices, and there is good
                                communication from the President's men to one another. In part this
                                is the result of informal communication, and in part is the result
                                of a regular staff meeting now held each morning under <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>. Those who attend with
                                regularity are: <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, <persName

                                    corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName>, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KC2"
                                    >Kaysen</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2"
                                >Komer</persName>, <persName>C. Johnson</persName>, <persName>R.
                                    Johnson</persName>, <persName>Belk</persName>, <persName>Hanson
                                    and Shepard</persName>.</p>
                            <p>This staff meeting is an informal affair, because no one has formal
                                authority, but it keeps us all informed of what the President wants
                                and what the day's situation is. In particular, this meeting allows
                                for prompt report on any trouble or opportunity in any task force,
                                for the staff is represented on all operating forces.</p></item>
                        <item>Fourth, gradually, and still imperfectly, members of the White
                                House-<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff have assumed defined
                            assignments for specific areas of the world. These assignments (listed
                            in the attached paper, Annex A)<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">Not found
                                attached.</note> do not distinguish between “planning” and
                            “operation,” and resistance to this distinction is fundamental to our
                            whole concept of work. The old pattern completely separated the general
                            plan from the concrete work. This Administration does not think that
                            way, and the staff does not work that way.</item>
                        <item>Fifth, the White House-<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> group has
                            gradually encouraged the growth of responsible self-reliance in the
                            Departments, and especially in the Department of State. The first
                            stimulus has come from the President: his personal decision formed the
                            post-invasion Cuban task force under <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul
                                Nitze</persName>, and his approval has been responsible for all
                            other action. But the incentive for special task forces on South
                            Viet-nam, Korea and Iran came from the staff, and the process of
                            follow-up has drawn deeply on the energies of the staff. Quietly, but
                            persistently, White House men have pressed for activity and energy. This
                            is true also for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. But the State
                            Department has been encouraged, not trodden on, and its internal energy,
                            with critical exceptions, is growing.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0140"/>
                    <p>The White House-<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> group has thus
                        effectively accepted the concept of Departmental responsibility with which
                        the Administration began. Criticism of the sort lately leveled at White
                        House men for work in Latin America is wildly beside the point; the
                        President's men have sometimes filled vacuums as best they could, but they
                        have never tried to take over the work of men who showed energy and ability
                        of their own. The exact opposite is the case.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the White House-<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> group represents
                        a high level of ability. No comparable dozen men, I believe, meets regularly
                        anywhere in Washington, and no executive in Washington has a more wholly
                        loyal group of agents than the President in these men.</p>
                    <p>Much has been accomplished, but much remains to be done. The staff is much
                        closer to the State Department than it is to Defense, and what it knows of
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is limited to a handful of top
                        officials. There is a clear need in the White House for a senior military
                        adviser, and in one way or another the world of intelligence needs closer
                        connection to the President. In part, this is a matter of increased direct
                        contact; in part, it is a matter of reinforced staff, and somewhat thickened
                        procedures.</p>
                    <p>Timing and rules of procedure for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        itself need some improvement. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> should
                        probably meet more regularly—though not more often—and at fixed times.
                        Against its schedules there should be a more clearly defined pattern of
                        preparation for new policy papers, and reporting on existing crisis areas.
                        Against a fixed pattern of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings,
                        much could be ordered that is now somewhat haphazard. This would require a
                        Presidential acceptance of routine that might be dull. But meetings that are
                        called suddenly, or suddenly called off, make staff work hard.</p>
                    <p>The staff labors under some handicaps in being half-in and half-out of the
                        White House. This is not easy to change without changing the statutes, but
                        it would probably help if all staff members could have courtesy access to
                        such immediate conveniences as White House transport and membership in the
                        White House mess.</p>
                    <p>The mechanism of interdepartmental coordination should be carefully, but
                        sparingly, increased. The experience of the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                            >OCB</gloss> shows how dangerous this sort of thing can be, but in the
                        first few months we have probably gone too far the other way. In this
                        instance, I believe that the administrative responsibility should rest with
                        the White House, and I am proposing a revision of certain weekly meetings to
                        ensure that somewhat more formal processes are followed. But it should be
                        clearly understood that in my own judgment such a modest revision should in
                        no sense replace the department as the agency of daily action, and the task
                        force, <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0141"/>with a specified Chairman,
                        as the instrument of interdepartmental performance in a time of crisis.</p>
                    <p>Above all, the White House-<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> group needs
                        what the whole executive branch needs, a renewal of strength and energy in
                        the operating departments. We believe that progress is being made on this
                        front too, but that more progress is urgently needed, and our specific
                        recommendations on ways and means are being put to appropriate officers as
                        we go along.<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">On September 4, <persName

                    <p>I wish to inform the Joint Chiefs of Staff as follows with regard to my views
                        of their relations to me in Cold War Operations: <list>

                            <item>I regard the Joint Chiefs of Staff as my principal military
                                advisor responsible both for initiating advice to me and for
                                responding to requests for advice. I expect their advice to come to

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have a responsibility for the defense of
                                the nation in the Cold War similar to that which they have in
                                conventional hostilities. They should know the military and
                                paramilitary forces and resources available to the Department of
                                Defense, verify their readiness, report on their adequacy, and make
                                appropriate recommendations for their expansion and improvement. I
                                look to the Chiefs to contribute dynamic and imaginative leadership
                                in contributing to the success of the military and paramilitary
                                aspects of Cold War programs.</item>

                            <item>I expect the Joint Chiefs of Staff to present the military
                                viewpoint in governmental councils in such a way as to assure that
                                the military factors are clearly understood before decisions are
                                reached. When only the Chairman or a single Chief is present, that
                                officer must represent the Chiefs as a body, taking such preliminary
                                and subsequent actions as may be necessary to assure that he does in
                                fact represent the corporate judgment of the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff.</item>

                            <item>While I look to the Chiefs to present the military factor without
                                reserve or hesitation, I regard them to be more than military men
                                and expect their help in fitting military requirements into the

                            <item>For the purpose of this study, a paramilitary operation is
                                considered to be one which by its tactics and its requirements in
                                military-type personnel, equipment and training approximates a
                                conventional military operation. It may be undertaken in support of
                                an existing government friendly to the U.S. or in support of a rebel
                                group seeking to overthrow a government hostile to us. The U.S. may
                                render assistance to such operations overtly, covertly or by a
                                combination of both methods. In size these operations may vary from
                                the infiltration of a squad of guerrillas to a military operation
                                such as the Cuban invasion. The small operations will often fall
                                completely within the normal capability of one <pb n="113"

                                    effectiveness and flexibility within the context of the Cold

                                    modified to effect the following:</p>
                                <p>a. Any proposed paramilitary operation in the concept stage will
                                    be presented to the Strategic Resources Group for initial
                                    consideration and for approval as necessary by the President.
                                    Thereafter, the <gloss target="#t_SRG1">SRG</gloss> will assign
                                    primary responsibility for planning, for interdepartment
                                    coordination and for execution to the Task Force, department or
                                    individual best qualified to carry forward the operation to
                                    success, and will indicate supporting responsibilities. Under
                                    this principle, the Department of Defense will normally receive
                                    responsibility for overt paramilitary operations. Where such an
                                    operation is to be wholly covert or disavowable, it may be
                                    assigned to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, provided that
                                    it is within the normal capabilities of the agency. Any large
                                    paramilitary operation wholly or partly covert which requires
                                    significant numbers of militarily trained personnel, amounts of

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bob</hi>:</p>
                    <p>We have reviewed in the State Department the draft which was prepared in the
                        Defense Department of the military sections of Basic National Security
                            Policy.<note n="1" xml:id="d35fn1">See <ref target="#d30fn2">footnote 2,

                    <p>We have given specific comments on many points to the drafters. There is one
                        point, however, which seemed important enough to warrant my writing you
                        directly about it. <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0146"/>I refer to the
                        provision that the main basis for US local war planning should be the plan
                        for resumption of hostilities in Korea. I am informed that this provision
                        means that no major increase in the present scale of US conventional forces
                        is required.</p>
                    <p>I am not competent to speak to the military need, but I would like to suggest
                        some foreign policy considerations which seem to me to be relevant.</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>There seems no assurance that future local conflicts will be confined
                            to the scale of the Korean war. There may well be two simultaneous
                            aggressions, whose aggregate scope will exceed that of the Korean war.
                            It would be useful, from a foreign policy stand point, to have a
                            military posture which did not require us to use nuclear weapons in the
                            event of a local conflict which exceeds the scale of the Korean war, but
                            left us free to make the decision on whether or not to use nuclear
                            weapons at the time.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item><p>The Communists appear to have entered on a period of dangerous
                                over-confidence. We must disabuse them, if there is not to be a
                                serious risk of miscalculation on their part.</p>
                            <p>One of the steps that would be most helpful to this end would be a
                                significant increase in the size of our armed forces. A government
                                as traditionally preoccupied with ground strength as that of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not fail to take
                                note. The Kremlin would surely be impressed by U.S. willingness to
                                incur the increased expenditures and draft calls that would be
                                involved. It might consider that this portended a U.S. willingness
                                to assume risks—as well as costs—that the U.S. had hitherto
                                considered unacceptable.</p></item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Such a U.S. move might also suggest to the Soviets that a continuation
                            of their pressures could trigger an even further expansion of the
                            permanent U.S. defense establishment. This would be a more effective
                            deterrent than mobilization of reserves, whom the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would expect to return to civilian
                            life at the end of the crisis. The Soviets must, even now, bitterly
                            regret the lasting quantum jump in the U.S. armed forces which was
                            produced by the Korean war.</item>

                        <item>An expansion in the size of our armed forces could also have a useful
                            effect on our allies. It would be welcome evidence of U.S. firmness at a
                            time of crisis. It might increase their confidence in our willingness to
                            stand up in their defense. The U.S. willingness to incur increased
                            defense burdens might, furthermore, encourage our allies to follow suit;
                            this would be most helpful in carrying out our new <gloss

                    <p>I realize that these factors may not be decisive, since important fiscal and
                        military factors are also involved, but I thought that I should bring them
                        to your attention before you had completed preparation of the military

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To examine the scale and nature of the Sino-Soviet Bloc air defense
                            system,<note n="1" xml:id="d36fn1">Includes defenses against missiles
                            and satellites. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> and probable
                        trends in its capabilities through mid-1966.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Summary and Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. The scale of effort presently being applied to the continuing improvement
                        and modernization of the Soviet air defense system is indicative of the high
                        priority assigned to this mission. During the past two to three years, the
                        Soviet air defense establishment has been undergoing a major transition
                        which has significantly improved its capabilities. The principal aspects of
                        this transition are: (a) the extensive deployment of surface-to-air missile
                        sites; (b) the installation of air defense communications and control
                        systems with semiautomatic features; (c) the deployment of new fighters and
                        radars to Eastern Europe and areas near the borders of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; and (d) a consolidation of air defense
                        districts. Other developments include the advent of radars with better
                        detection and height-finding capabilities, and the equipment of interceptors
                        with more advanced electronic gear and armament, including air-to-air
                        missiles. (Paras. 16-24)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Surface-to-Air Missiles</hi></p>
                    <p>2. The Soviets now have operational two types of surface-to-air missiles
                        designed for defense against medium and high altitude air attacks. The first
                        of these (SA-1), which has been operational for about five years, is
                        deployed only around Moscow in a massive complex of 56 sites, each having 60
                        launching positions. This system was apparently designed to counter the
                        massed air raid threat of the late 1940's and early 1950's. (Paras.
                        25-26)</p>
                    <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0148"/>
                    <p>3. Since late 1957, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been
                        engaged in the extensive deployment of a second-generation surface-to-air
                        missile system (SA-2), which appears designed to cope with the threat posed
                        by small numbers of aircraft carrying nuclear weapons rather than a massed
                        raid threat. Considering the pattern of deployment, the length of time the
                        program has been under way, and the extent of our intelligence coverage, we
                        estimate that 350-400 sites (each with six launchers) are now operational at
                        about 70 defended areas in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. By
                        mid-1962, the Soviets probably will have deployed roughly 500 SA-2 sites at
                        about 100 urban-industrial areas in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. There is little evidence on possible requirements for
                        defense of field forces, but we estimate that some 80-120 mobile missile
                        units may be deployed by the end of 1963 for the protection of such
                        semifixed targets as major headquarters and logistics centers. We believe
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> intends to provide SA-2
                        defenses for the fixed launching complexes of its long range ballistic
                        missile forces, but we are unable to estimate the level and extent of
                        defenses planned. (Paras. 27-33)</p>
                    <p>4. Deployment of SA-2 sites in the European Satellites has been under way for
                        more than a year. The heaviest deployment has occurred in East Germany where
                        as many as 20 sites may be operational or under construction. Some of these,
                        located on a ring around Berlin, are manned by East German forces; others,
                        which defend important Soviet military targets, are assigned to Soviet field
                        forces. We believe that additional SA-2 sites will be deployed in the
                        Satellites during the next year or two, and that some mobile units may be
                        provided for Satellite ground forces. We have no reliable evidence
                        indicating the deployment of surface-to-air missiles in Communist China,
                        although some deployment may have taken place or be planned for the future.
                        (Paras. 34-36)</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviets have had under development a surface-to-air system (SA-3)
                        which we believe is specifically designed to engage targets at very low
                        altitudes. Although no operational sites have been observed, we believe that
                        this system will probably be available for operational use in 1961.
                        Considering the scale and pace of the SA-2 program, we believe that SA-3
                        will be extensively deployed within the next three or four years,
                        supplementing existing missile defenses of fixed targets and field forces.
                        (Paras. 37-38)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Antimissile Program</hi></p>
                    <p>6. To develop defenses against ballistic missiles, the Soviets have had under
                        way for several years an extensive and high priority program which we
                        believe to be directed primarily toward defense against <gloss
                            target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s. We have no basis for a firm estimate on the date of
                        initial operational deployment of a Soviet anti-ballistic missile system or
                        its effectiveness against the various types of Western ballistic missiles.
                        For political as well as military reasons, the Soviets probably would wish
                        to deploy antimissile defenses in a few critical areas even if the available
                            <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0149"/>system provided only a limited,
                        interim capability. Considering these factors and the present status of the
                        Soviet research and development program, we estimate that in the period
                        1963-1966 the Soviets will begin at least limited deployment of an
                        antimissile system. We believe that for some years to come, the Soviets are
                        likely to have only a marginal capability under most favorable conditions
                        for interference with US satellites. (Paras. 40-46)</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of fighters, supporting equipment, and
                        deployment.]</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Civil Defense</hi></p>
                    <p>11. About 80 million Soviet citizens over the age of 16 have received some
                        instruction in civil defense and about one-fourth of these have probably
                        received good basic grounding in elementary civil defense techniques. The
                        bulk of the population still lacks adequate shelters, although the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has a substantial lead over any of the
                        Western Powers in the construction of urban shelters which could provide
                        some protection against fall-out, debris, and fire. In the past two years,
                        the Soviets have given increasing attention to preattack evacuation of
                        nonessential civilians in the event of a threatening situation, but this
                        program appears to be still in the planning stage. Even with limited
                        warning, the existence of a disciplined organization, the use of shelter,
                        and the widespread knowledge of simple techniques such as first aid would
                        probably reduce casualties considerably, especially among key personnel.
                        However, Soviet civil defense is not prepared to cope with the effects of
                        large-scale nuclear attack. Moreover, it would function extremely poorly
                        under conditions of short warning time. (Paras. 73-76)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Warning Time</hi></p>
                    <p>12. The amount of warning time available significantly affects the
                        capabilities of air defense in various areas of the Bloc. Early warning
                        radar could now give Moscow and many other targets in the interior more than
                        one hour's warning of medium and high altitude attacks made with Western
                        bombers of the B-52 type. Soviet assurance of such detection would be
                        greatly reduced by extremely low level penetrations. The supersonic bombers
                        and air-to-surface missiles now being added to Western inventories could
                        reduce this warning time by as much as 50 percent. Moreover, the more
                        limited early warning time available in Bloc border areas would reduce the
                        effectiveness of the defenses of even heavily defended targets in such
                        areas. As the speeds of Western aerodynamic vehicles increase, and as
                        Western ballistic missiles become a greater threat, the problem of warning
                        time will become more critical. (Para. 78)</p>
                    <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0150"/>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Current Capabilities and Future
                            Trends</hi></p>
                    <p>13. The present capabilities of the Soviet air defense system would be
                        greatest against penetrations by subsonic bombers in daylight and clear
                        weather at altitudes between about 3,000 and about 45,000 feet. Under such
                        conditions, virtually all types of Bloc air defense weapons could be brought
                        to bear against attacking aircraft. Most Soviet fighters can operate at
                        altitudes up to about 50,000 feet, and some up to about 55,000 feet, but the
                        capabilities of the fighter force would be reduced considerably during
                        periods of darkness or poor visibility. In the increasingly widespread areas
                        defended by surface-to-air missiles, air defense capabilities would be
                        virtually unimpaired by weather conditions and would extend to about 60,000
                        feet, with some capabilities up to about 80,000 feet. (Para. 79)</p>
                    <p>14. Despite its recent and considerable improvements, however, the Soviet air
                        defense system would still have great difficulty in coping with a
                        large-scale air attack employing a variety of weapons and sophisticated
                        tactics, even within the foregoing altitudes. At altitudes below about 3,000
                        feet, the capabilities of the system would be progressively reduced; below
                        about 1,000 feet, the system would lose most of its effectiveness. At
                        present, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has little capability for
                        active defense against very low altitude attacks. (Paras. 80-81)</p>
                    <p>15. The Soviets are making vigorous efforts to counter Western weapon
                        systems. Within the next five years, they will probably introduce improved
                        radars and all-weather interceptors, a surface-to-air missile system
                        designed to counter low altitude air attack, and antimissile defenses.
                        However, they probably will still not achieve a high degree of assurance in
                        coping with a large-scale sophisticated attack by manned bombers. They would
                        probably expect to destroy a significant number of attackers, but given the
                        increasing complexity of the air defense problem, we doubt they will be
                        confident of the extent to which they can reduce the weight of such an
                        attack. The air defense problem has been radically altered by the advent of
                        long-range ballistic missiles. Barring an unforeseen technological
                        breakthrough, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s air defense
                        deficiencies and uncertainties will sharply increase as ballistic missiles
                        assume a larger proportion of the West's total nuclear delivery capability.

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Dean</persName></hi>:</p>
                    <p>We appreciate receiving your views on the draft military section of Basic
                        National Security Policy, as set forth in your letter of July 9th.</p>
                    <p>I note that your principal concern is over U.S. local war planning. The
                        pertinent provision of the draft which you reviewed stated that, “At the
                        present time the main basis for U.S. local war planning is the plan for the
                        resumption of hostilities in Korea. For the present, the level of forces
                        called for in this plan, including the mobilization of U.S. reserve forces,
                        remains the basis of U.S. local war planning outside of Europe.”</p>
                    <p>As a result of subsequent work here in the Department of Defense we are
                        considering a modification of the foregoing provision in a manner which I
                        believe you will find more satisfactory. Moreover, we plan to emphasize even
                        more clearly than in the earlier revision that there must be adequate
                        military alternatives to the initiation of general war by the U.S., and that
                        the greatest importance is attached to giving the President the option to
                        commit substantial non-nuclear forces before having to decide to initiate
                        the use of nuclear weapons in defense of U.S. commitments.<note n="1"

                    <p>The resolution of the order of magnitude of forces to be used in local war
                        planning may well be the outgrowth of the present intensive re-examination
                        of our forces now going on in the light of the Berlin situation,
                        particularly the analysis of the ways of strengthening our forces by
                        increasing their non-nuclear capability.</p>

                        Defense had “set aside, at least temporarily,” the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1"
                            >BNSP</gloss> review “partly because of the Berlin situation and party
                        because the interagency clearance process had resulted in the document being
                        filled with old and familiar clichés.” Kitchen noted that the Department of
                        State was not “guilty of encumbering the document as indicated since most of
                        our comments were encouraging and imaginative.” (Department of State,

                            >McNamara</persName>'s decision. On July 5, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        circulated a draft emphasizing retention of “free world” military
                        superiority. In general war, U.S. forces should in the short term be
                        “capable of emerging from a nuclear exchange with a clear military
                        advantage,” and for the longer term should “possess the highest practicable
                        degree of alert and be capable of a range of options, including those made
                        possible by a secure reserve, to increase control of response and enhance
                        military flexibility.” Limited war forces were to be sufficient, “in
                        conjunction with available local forces, [to] retard aggression” long enough
                        to permit reinforcement, “making every feasible effort to keep the war at a
                        non-nuclear level, but being prepared to use nuclear weapons when required.”

                            >JCS</gloss> draft.” It did, however, “retain the fundamental concepts
                        of previous <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> versions: the stress on
                        non-nuclear warfare and the requirement for discriminate and flexible
                        general war operations under tight central control.” <persName

                    <p>Regarding the outcome of a general war, the draft stated that the United
                        States should “conduct general war so as to obtain the best achievable
                        outcome” and that “consistent with over-all objectives, the U.S. will
                        conduct general war so as to facilitate the conduct of negotiations to bring
                        the war to an end.” Regarding overall defense posture, the draft spoke of
                        “the capacity to meet any military situation discriminately with sufficient,
                        but not excessive, measures” and of having the “option to engage substantial
                        non-nuclear forces before having to decide to initiate the use of nuclear
                        weapons.” The draft stressed that the desired flexibility, <pb n="122"
                            xml:id="pg_122" facs="0154"/>while not in being, was to be
                        “progressively and rapidly created.” (Ibid.; copies of the <gloss

                    <p>In a July 28 note to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, the Joint
                        Strategic Survey Council recommended that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> “should not be drawn into discussion of what is
                        specifically wrong with <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> draft of <gloss
                            target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> in manner which would place <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> draft in competition with it,” or which
                        would preclude the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> giving a copy of
                        their position to the President or to members of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> disagreed and at
                        their request the Joint Strategic Survey Council submitted to them on August
                        5 a “talking paper” in support of the positions taken in the July 5 <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> draft. The talking paper stated that the
                            <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> draft was “negative and inhibiting
                        in nature and tended to over-emphasize control of military forces, avoidance
                        of casualties and damage, defense, survival, without comparable concern for
                        combat effectiveness, the offensive, or the will to succeed.” The paper
                        further noted: “An overly inhibited <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss>
                        could permeate the whole structure of a people and government to the point
                        where the all-important will to win disappears.” The <gloss
                            target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> “should reflect confidence,
                        determination, combat effectiveness, and the offensive spirit, if the United
                        States is to survive and prosper.” The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        believed in “control of military operations by constituted authority” but
                        believed “that it [control] should be covered broadly and succinctly in
                            <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> with specific details left to
                        technical plans and policies.” The <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> draft
                        tended “to emphasize non-nuclear weapons even more than current policy
                        emphasizes nuclear weapons.” The covering note to the talking paper
                        recommended the Secretary's adoption of the July 5 <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> draft as the position of the Department of Defense. (Ibid.)

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> opened the
                        discussion with a briefing on what happened on the Hill.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> testimony
                        that morning before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the call-up of
                        reserves in the Berlin crisis and of aircraft procurement.]</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> then continued the
                        discussion of the Committee reaction and stated that they had been very
                        greatly concerned about the question of when the President might use nuclear
                        weapons if we actually got into war. They also wanted to know how long we
                        could fight a conventional war prior to employing nuclear weapons with the
                        buildup now being anticipated and asked for. It was the sense of the
                        Committee that we must prove our willingness and agree to use nuclear
                        weapons if this crisis continues. They had the feeling that our de-emphasis
                        on nuclear weapons might encourage Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> to think that we would not be willing and able to
                        use nuclear weapons, and consequently, they urged the Administration to hold
                        this line firmly so that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> might not misinterpret our conventional
                            buildup.<note n="1" xml:id="d40fn1">This issue was also discussed at the

                    <p>The President then talked about the difficulty in Central Europe with a
                        conventional war and stated that he felt that the critical point is to be
                        able to use nuclear weapons at a crucial moment before they use them. He
                        inquired as to our capabilities of making such a decision without letting
                        the enemy know that we are about to do it.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> first responded to this
                        inquiry with a description of when and how <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss> could be used and the amount of warning time under various
                        conditions that the Soviet Union could derive from our attack approach. The
                        President then asked several questions about the Soviet capability to detect
                        and to react.</p>
                    <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0156"/>
                    <p>There was a further discussion of the command and control centers which now
                        exist especially in regard to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> use
                        of nuclear weapons. General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>
                        pointed out during this discussion that there is a <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss> Airborne Command post which could be used in case of
                        disaster and Admiral Russell pointed out that the Navy has a Command Post
                        afloat.</p>
                    <p>During this latter discussion the President directed that we get out all the
                        letters of agreement with our allies, especially the British, the French,
                        and the Canadians, to our consulting them before a nuclear attack is
                        launched.</p>
                    <p>During this discussion, General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>
                        told the President that we could take off from the bases in Spain without
                        any previous notification, but all the rest had strings on them, one kind
                        and another.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of the Berlin crisis and Cuba.]</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> then pointed out
                        that the program on Capitol Hill was pretty well set, but that civil defense
                        didn't get much play in the hearing. The President asked some specific
                        questions and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said
                        the Nike-Zeus was not mentioned, but that Senator Symington had made quite a
                        point about manned bombers. There had been some discussion of the B-70, but
                        the greatest concern in the Committee was the adequacy and modernization of
                        our fighter bomber force.</p>
                    <p>One additional point from the Committee was that they feel we should take
                        stronger measures to “fire up our production lines” for the long pull even
                        though we may not be taking much end product from these production lines at
                        the moment.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of Cuba and the Berlin crisis.]</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> then reported that
                        the Joint Chiefs had been reviewing our overall National Security Council
                        policies in an effort to derive a new statement of military policy. He
                        pointed out that the Joint Chiefs had not confined themselves to the
                        military policy section, but had studied and commented upon the overall
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policies, but had paid the most
                        attention to the military section. He said that this recently completed
                        review had been forwarded to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of

                        to have his comments attached. This could give the President the necessary
                        information on which to base a decision for or against General Power's
                        suggestion. The President agreed.</p>
                    <p>General Power expressed great concern over the lack of information on Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites, stating that we had only
                        10% usable photographic coverage of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. Since in the photographed area 20 <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> pads had been found, there might be many
                        times more in the unphotographed area. Generals <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>
                        contested the accuracy of this estimate of useful coverage and the
                        conclusion drawn from it.</p>
                    <p>In view of our lack of information, General Power strongly recommended the
                        resumption of U-2 flights.</p>
                    <p>In response to questions by the President, General Power indicated his belief
                        that the time of our greatest danger of a Soviet surprise attack is now and
                        during the coming year. If a general atomic war is inevitable, the U.S.
                        should strike first—presumably after locating the essential Soviet nuclear
                        targets.</p>

                    <p>The President also directed that the group come up with an answer to this
                        question: how much information does the Soviet Union need, and how long do
                        they need to launch their missiles?</p>

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. New information, providing a much firmer base for estimates on Soviet long
                        range ballistic missiles, has caused a sharp downward revision in our
                        estimate of present Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength
                        but strongly supports our estimate of medium range missile strength.</p>
                    <p>2. We now estimate that the present Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> strength is in the range of 10-25 launchers from which
                        missiles can be fired against the US, and that this force level will not
                        increase markedly during the months immediately ahead.<note n="2"

                            See his footnote following the Conclusions. [Footnote in the source
                            text. The footnote with the position of Assistant Chief of Staff,
                            Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, is not printed. His
                            position was that the Soviets had about 50 operational <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers in mid-1961 and would have
                            about 100 in mid-1962 and about 250 in mid-1963. The early availability
                            and high performance record of the first generation <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers indicated that by mid-1961
                            “substantial” numbers had been deployed, and he believed that the
                            deployed force constituted a “serious threat to US-based nuclear
                            striking forces.” He believed that the Soviets would continue to deploy
                            first generation missiles until the second generation missiles became
                            available.]</note> We also estimate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> now has about 250-300 operational launchers equipped with
                        700 and 1,100 n.m. ballistic missiles. The bulk of these <gloss
                            target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> launchers are in western <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, within range of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> targets in Europe; others are in southern <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and in the Soviet Far East. <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>
                        launchers probably have sufficient missiles to provide a reload capability
                        and to fire additional missiles after a period of some hours, assuming that
                        the launching facilities are not damaged by accident or attack.</p>
                    <p>3. The low present and near-term <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force
                        level probably results chiefly from a Soviet decision to deploy only a small
                        force of the cumbersome, first generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s, and to press the development of a smaller, second
                        generation system. Under emergency conditions the existing force could be
                        supplemented somewhat during the first half of 1962, but Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength will probably not increase
                        substantially until the new missile is ready for operational use, probably
                        sometime in the latter half of 1962. After this point, we anticipate that
                        the number of operational launchers will begin to increase significantly. On
                        this basis, we estimate that the force level in mid-1963 will approximate
                        75-125 operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers.<note

                        ready for operational use late this year or early next year. The <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s combined strength in these missile
                        categories will probably reach 350-450 operational launchers in the

                    <p>5. Soviet professions of greatly enhanced striking power thus derive
                        primarily from a massive capability to attack European and other peripheral
                        targets. Although Soviet propaganda has assiduously cultivated an image of
                        great <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength, the bulk of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s present capability to attack the US is
                        in bombers and submarine-launched missiles rather than in a large <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. While the present <gloss

                    <p>22. We believe that our coverage of both test range activities and potential
                        deployment areas is adequate to support the judgment that at present there
                        are only a few <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> complexes operational
                        or under construction. While there are differences within the intelligence
                        community as to the progress of the Soviet program to date and the precise
                        composition of the current force, we estimate that the present Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability is in the range of 10-25
                        launchers from which missiles can be fired against the US. The low side of
                        this range allows for the possibility that the Soviets could now fire only a
                        token <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> salvo from a few launchers,
                        located at the Tyuratam rangehead and an operational complex, perhaps
                        Plesetsk. The high side, however, takes into account the limitations of our
                        coverage and allows for the existence of a few other complexes equipped with
                        first generation missiles, now operational but undetected.</p>
                    <p>23. The Soviet system is probably designed to have a refire capability from
                        each launcher. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may therefore be
                        able to fire a second salvo some hours after the first, assuming that the
                        launching facilities are not damaged by accident or attack.</p>
                    <p>24. The reasons for the small current capability are important to an estimate
                        of the future Soviet buildup. The first generation system, designed at an
                        early stage of Soviet nuclear and missile technology, proved to be powerful
                        and reliable but was probably too cumbersome to be deployed on a large
                        scale. One or more first generation sites may have been started but
                        cancelled. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not
                        declassified</hi>]The urgent development of at least one second generation
                        system probably began in about 1958, and an intensive firing program is now
                        underway concurrent with the construction of simplified deployment
                        complexes. We therefore believe that in about 1958 the Soviet leaders
                        decided to deploy <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0167"/>only a small
                        force of first generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s while
                        pressing toward second generation systems.</p>
                    <p>25. The net effect of this Soviet decision, together with whatever slippage
                        is occurring in the development of second generation systems, has been to
                        produce a low plateau of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength.
                        Under emergency conditions the existing force could be supplemented during
                        the first half of 1962 by putting some second generation <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s on launcher at one or two completed
                        complexes before the weapon system has been thoroughly tested. However, the
                        Soviets could not have very much confidence in the reliability, accuracy and
                        effectiveness of such a force. In any event, operational <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength will probably not increase
                        substantially until the new missile has been proved satisfactory for
                        operational use, probably some time in the latter half of 1962.
                        Alternatively, the possibility cannot be excluded that second generation
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s could be proved satisfactory for
                        operational use somewhat earlier in 1962, possibly as soon as the first
                        simplified complex is completed. After this point, we anticipate that the
                        number of operational launchers will begin to increase significantly.</p>
                    <p>26. We continue to believe, for the many reasons adduced in <gloss
                            target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-61, that the Soviet leaders have
                        desired a force of several hundred operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> launchers, to be acquired as soon as practicable over the
                        next few years. In addition to the complexes known to be under construction,
                        it is probable that work is under way on other undiscovered complexes and
                        that the construction of still others is scheduled to begin soon. Taking
                        account of this probability, together with our present intelligence coverage
                        and our information on site activation lead-time, we estimate that the force
                        level in mid-1963 will approximate 75-125 operational <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers. The high side of this range
                        allows for eight complexes of eight launchers each under construction at the
                        present time, with four more scheduled to begin by the end of the year; it
                        would require site activation time to decrease to about 18 months by the end
                        of the year; it builds from a present force level of about 25 operational
                        launchers. The low side of the mid-1963 range would be achieved if six
                        complexes were now under construction, two more were begun by the end of the
                        year, and the present force level were only about 10 launchers.</p>
                    <p>27. As noted in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-61, Soviet force
                        goals for the period to 1966 will be increasingly affected by developments
                        in US and Soviet military technology, including the multiplication of
                        hardened US missile sites, the possible advent of more advanced Soviet
                        missiles which can better be protected, and by developments in both
                        antimissile defenses and space weapons. The international political
                        situation will also affect Soviet force goals, and there is a good chance
                        that the Soviet leaders themselves have not yet come to a definite decision.
                        We have not been able as yet to review, in the light of the new evidence,
                        these and other considerations pertaining <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136"
                            facs="0168"/>to the probable future pace of the Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. Therefore we are unable to
                        project a numerical estimate beyond mid-1963. Considering the problems
                        involved in site activation, however, we believe that a rate of 100 or
                        possibly even 150 launchers per year beginning in about 1963 would be
                        feasible. To accomplish such a schedule, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> would have to lay on a major program of site construction
                        within the next year, which we believe would be detected [<hi rend="italic"

                        approximately 50 fixed sites with a total of about 200 pads suitable for

                        identified in a wide belt stretching from the Baltic to the southern
                        Ukraine. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] we are virtually certain that there are about 10
                        additional sites [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] Taking account of indicators pointing to still other

                            declassified</hi>] we estimate with high confidence that in the western
                        belt alone there are now about 75 sites with a total of about 300 launch
                        pads, completed or under construction. (For known and estimated site
                        locations in this area, see Figure 9.)</p>
                    <p>29. The new information does not establish whether individual sites are fully
                        operational, nor does it reveal which type of missile each is to employ.

                        declassified</hi>]approximately three-quarters of the identified sites
                        appeared to be complete or nearly so, some were under construction, and the
                        evidence on others is ambiguous. Construction has probably been completed at
                        some sites [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] the installation of support equipment and missiles
                        could probably be accomplished relatively quickly thereafter, perhaps in a
                        period of some weeks. Three basic site configurations have been observed,
                        all of them bearing a strong resemblance to launch areas at the Kapustin Yar
                        rangehead (see Figure 8).<note n="8" xml:id="d45fn8">Not printed.</note> Any
                        of the three types could employ either 700 or 1,100 n.m. missiles, whose
                        size and truck-mounted support equipment are virtually identical. The sites
                        could not employ <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, but one type might
                        be intended for the 2,000 n.m. <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> which
                        has been under development at Kapustin Yar.</p>
                    <p>30. On the basis of the new evidence and a wealth of other material on
                        development, production, training and deployment, we estimate that in the
                        western belt alone the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has about
                        200-250 operational launchers equipped with 700 and 1,1000 n.m. ballistic
                        missiles, together <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0169"/>with the
                        necessary supporting equipment and trained personnel. From these launchers,
                        missiles could be directed against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        targets from Norway to Turkey. On less firm but consistent evidence, about
                        50 additional launchers are believed to be operational in other areas: in
                        the Transcaucasus and Turkestan, from which they could attack Middle Eastern
                        targets from Suez to Pakistan; and in the southern portion of the Soviet Far
                        East within range of Japan, Korea, and Okinawa. [<hi rend="italic">less than
                            1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] the presence of some sites
                        in Turkestan and in the Soviet Far East, north of Vladivostok.</p>
                    <p>31. On this basis, we estimate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        now has a total of about 250-300 operational launchers equipped with medium
                        range ballistic missiles, the bulk of them within range of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> targets in Europe. This is essentially
                        the same numerical estimate as given in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                        11-8-61, but it is now made with greater assurance.</p>
                    <p>32. Contrary to our previous view that <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s
                        were deployed in mobile units, we now know that even though their support
                        equipment is truck-mounted, most if not all <gloss target="#t_MRBM1"
                            >MRBM</gloss> units employ fixed sites. Like the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> complexes, these are soft, screened from
                        ground observation by their placement in wooded areas, and protected against
                        air attack by surface-to-air missile sites in the vicinity. The systems are
                        probably designed so that all ready missiles at a site can be salvoed within
                        a few minutes of each other. Two additional missiles are probably available
                        for each launcher; a second salvo could probably be launched about 4-6 hours
                        after the first. There is some evidence that after one or two salvos the
                        units are to move from their fixed sites to reserve positions. Their
                        mobility could thus be used for their immediate protection, or they could
                        move to new launch points to support field forces in subsequent phases of a
                        war.</p>
                    <p>33. The Soviet planners apparently see a larger total requirement for <gloss
                            target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1"
                            >IRBM</gloss>s than we had supposed. While the rate of deployment
                        activity in the western belt is probably tapering off after a vigorous
                        three-year program, some sites of all three basic types are still under
                        construction. There will therefore be at least some increase in force levels
                        in the coming months. The magnitude of the buildup thereafter will depend
                        largely on the degree to which the 2,000 n.m. system is deployed, and
                        whether or not it will supplement or replace medium range missiles.</p>
                    <p>34. With the advent of the 2,000 n.m. <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>,
                        probably in late 1961 or early 1962, the Soviets will acquire new ballistic
                        missile capabilities against such areas as Spain, North Africa, and Taiwan.
                        To this extent at least, they probably wish to supplement their present
                        strength. They may also wish to deploy <gloss target="#t_IRBM1"
                        >IRBM</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s to more northerly
                        areas within range of targets in Greenland and Alaska. Moreover, evidence
                        from clandestine sources indicates that the Soviet field forces are exerting
                        pressure to acquire missiles of these ranges. In general, however, we <pb

                        program will emphasize changes in the mix among the existing systems, and
                        later the introduction of second generation systems, rather than sheer
                        numerical expansion. Taking these factors into account, we estimate that the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will achieve 350-450 operational

                            >IRBM</gloss> launchers sometime in the 1962-1963 period, and that the
                        force level will be relatively stable thereafter.</p>

                    <p>The estimated Total Obligational Authority required to procure and operate
                        these forces over this period is shown in the following table. The
                        difference between the Total Obligational Authority required to finance the
                        forces I am recommending and that required to finance the forces recommended
                        by the individual Services is shown on the second line. Over the five years,
                        1963-67, the cost of the aircraft and missiles recommended by the Air Force
                        and the Polaris recommended by the Navy exceeds the cost of the forces I am
                        recommending by approximately $10 billion. As will be shown later in this
                        paper, the extra capability provided by the individual Service proposals
                        runs up against strongly diminishing returns and yields very little in terms
                        of target destruction. In my judgment, it is an increment not worth the cost
                        of $10 billion over the five year period.</p>

                        1963 by the Navy would cost approximately $3.1 billions more to buy than the

                            Recommendations</hi></p>
                    <p>The forces I am recommending have been chosen to provide the United States
                        with the capability, in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack, first, to
                        strike back against Soviet bomber bases, missile sites, and other
                        installations associated with long-range nuclear forces, in order to reduce
                        Soviet power and limit the damage that can be done to us by vulnerable
                        Soviet follow-on forces, while, second, holding in protected reserve forces
                        capable of destroying the Soviet urban society, if necessary, in a
                        controlled and deliberate way. With the recommended forces, I am confident
                        that we will be able, at all times, to deny the Soviet Union the prospect of
                        either a military victory or of knocking out the U.S. retaliatory force. If
                        the most likely estimates of Soviet forces prove to be correct, the forces I
                        am recommending should provide us a capability to achieve a substantial
                        military superiority over the Soviets even after they have attacked us.</p>
                    <p>The recommended forces are designed to avoid the extremes of a “minimum
                        deterrence” posture on the one hand, or a “full first strike capability” on
                        the other. A “minimum deterrence” posture is one in which, after a Soviet
                        attack, we would have a capability to retaliate, and with a high degree of
                        assurance be able to destroy most of Soviet urban society, but in which we
                        would not have a capability to counter-attack against Soviet military
                        forces. A “full first strike capability” would be achieved if our forces
                        were so large and so effective, in relation to those of the Soviet Union,
                        that we would be able to attack and reduce Soviet retaliatory power to the
                        point at which it could not cause severe damage to U.S. population and
                        industry.</p>
                    <p>We should reject the “minimum deterrence” extreme for the following reasons: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>Deterrence may fail, or war may break out for accidental or
                                unintended reasons, and if it does, a capability to counter-attack
                                against high-priority Soviet military targets can make a major
                                contribution to the objectives of limiting damage and terminating
                                the war on acceptable terms;</item>
                            <label>b.</label>
                            <item>By reducing to a minimum the possibility of a U.S. nuclear attack
                                in response to Soviet aggression against our Allies, a “minimum
                                deterrence” posture would weaken our ability to deter such Soviet
                                attacks.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we should reject the attempt to achieve a “full first
                        strike capability” for the following reasons: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>It is almost certainly infeasible. The Soviets could defeat such
                                an attempt at relatively low cost. For example, we do not now have
                                any prospect of being able to destroy in a sudden attack Soviet
                                missile submarines at sea. Nor would we be able to destroy a
                                sufficiently high percentage of a large hard and dispersed <gloss

                            <item>It would put the Soviets in a position which they would be likely
                                to consider intolerable, thus risking the provocation of an arms
                                race.</item>
                            <label>c.</label>
                            <item>It would be very costly in resources that are needed to strengthen
                                our theatre forces.</item>

                    <p>The forces I am recommending will provide major improvements in the quality
                        of our strategic posture: in its survivability, its flexibility, and its
                        ability to be used in a controlled and deliberate way under a wide range of
                        contingencies.</p>

                    <p>These totals can be compared with the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                            target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss>-62, the current war plan. There are
                        inevitably uncertainties, especially about details, when looking so far into
                        the future. However, taken as a whole, I am satisfied with this target
                        system as a basis for force planning.</p>
                    <p>The 200 Urban-Industrial targets and the 150 bomber bases have the highest
                        priority in the sense of required degree of assurance that we can destroy
                        them. The capability to destroy the Urban-Industrial targets is our power to
                        deter attacks on our own cities. The Bomber Bases contain the part of the
                        Soviet Forces that can cause us the most damage if not attacked, and also
                        the part most vulnerable to attack. In the event of thermonuclear war, it is
                        important that we destroy the maximum possible number of Soviet long range
                        bombers. The 150 targets listed here represent a fairly generous allowance
                        for this purpose. They include about 50 <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144"
                            facs="0176"/>bases now known or estimated to be supporting long-range
                        air operations, about 60 now known or estimated to be supporting light
                        bomber operations, most of which would be usable as recovery bases for the
                        long-range bombers, and about 30 staging bases on which the medium bombers
                        depend for range enough to reach the United States.</p>
                    <p>However, the other targets are also potentially important and worth
                        attacking. The Supporting Airfields (potential recovery and dispersal
                        bases), Nuclear Storage and Production sites, and Naval and Submarine bases
                        all can support delivery of nuclear weapons on the United States. The <gloss
                            target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> sites represent a threat to our Allies
                        and our theatre forces, and are most economically attacked by a system such
                        as Minuteman. The Defense Suppression targets, air defense control centers,
                        interceptor bases, and surface-to-air missile sites, can be effectively
                        attacked by the air-launched missiles Hound Dog and Skybolt. Their
                        destruction would drastically reduce the defense opposition faced by our
                        manned bombers. The number 300 shown here is probably a generous allowance
                        for the purpose. For example, <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> is now
                        estimating a requirement to destroy 160 defense suppression targets in
                        1968.</p>
                    <p>The size and basing (i.e. degree of hardening and dispersal) of the Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force in 1965 and 1967 is now a
                        matter of considerable uncertainty. Everything we know about the Soviet
                        long-range nuclear delivery posture to date suggests that the most likely
                        configuration for first-generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        sites will be 2 missiles per site and soft. Such sites would present
                        attractive targets for our forces. However, hard and dispersed basing for
                        their next generation of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s would be
                        such a logical choice for the Soviets that the possibility must be
                        considered reasonably likely even though there is no evidence now to suggest
                        that the Soviets are hardening their missiles.</p>
                    <p>There are also uncertainties about the performance of our forces in striking
                        back after a Soviet attack—uncertainties associated with the weight and
                        effectiveness of possible Soviet attacks, the ability of our forces to
                        survive under attack, the reliability of our missiles, and the ability of
                        our forces to penetrate Soviet defenses. But these uncertainties are not
                        unbounded. One can place reasonable quantitative limits on them and estimate
                        the effectiveness of our forces under alternatively optimistic and
                        pessimistic assumptions.</p>
                    <p>This is what has been done in the following analysis. The survival
                        reliability, and penetration factors used are all based on the general
                        assumption that the war begins with a well planned and well executed Soviet
                        attack, with limited warning, against our forces in a state of normal
                        peacetime alert, and that we are hitting back after being attacked. Thus the
                        following estimates do not represent maximum capabilities under the most
                        favorable circumstances. For example, they exclude cases in which we strike
                        first, or cases in which we are attacked during a <pb n="145"
                            xml:id="pg_145" facs="0177"/>period of tension and alert. These cases
                        have been excluded because we are testing the adequacy of our forces, and
                        therefore must look at unfavorable circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Within the general assumption of a well planned Soviet attack, optimistic,
                        median, and pessimistic survival, reliability, and penetration factors have
                        been chosen to reflect the range of uncertainty. It is possible to imagine
                        outcomes lying outside this range, but their likelihood appears small. The
                        optimistic factors represent favorable, but attainable performance. The
                        great weight of likelihood appears to be between the optimistic and median
                        cases. The combination of all of the pessimistic factors describes a very
                        unfavorable and relatively improbable case. For example, it is assumed that
                        in 1967, only [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] per cent of the manned bombers reach the bomb release
                        line and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] per cent of the Titans and [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] per cent of the fixed
                        Minuteman missiles are destroyed before launch. These factors were chosen to
                        produce an answer to the question “What happens if everything goes badly?”
                        (The details of the assumed factors, together with an explanation of their
                        choice can be found in Annex 1 to this Appendix.)<note n="4" xml:id="d46fn4"
                            >“Assumed Operational Factors for 1965 and 1967 Target Damage
                            Calculations,” not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>The pessimistic factors do not include an allowance for attrition by Soviet
                            anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> defenses. We recognize that
                        the Soviets do have a large R&amp;D program in this area. However, we are
                        pursuing a vigorous program of development of penetration aids (decoys and
                        multiple warheads) and we expect to be able to penetrate Soviet defenses in
                        this period. Moreover, if attrition by Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> defenses appears at all likely, we will be able to
                        compensate for it in large measure by concentrating our forces on the top
                        priority targets.</p>
                    <p>The following results are shown in terms of expected percentages of the
                        targets or value in each category destroyed. In the case of Urban-Industrial
                        Floor Space (and Urban Blast Fatalities), the estimates are of damage to the
                        contents of the 170 largest cities (down to a population of 90,000) which
                        contains approximately 80 per cent of the total industrial floor space of
                        the Soviet Union and approximately 50 million out of a total of 210 million
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The estimates of total population fatalities are percentages of the Soviet
                        total. The “Unsheltered” case corresponds to the effects expected in a
                        population without extensive civil defense preparation, but taking advantage
                        of what shelter is normally available. The “Sheltered” case corresponds to
                        fallout shelter for 40 per cent of the urban population and 20 percent of
                        the rural. The “At Least” reflects the fact that the estimates do not
                        include fallout from attacks on isolated military targets. (The <pb n="146"
                            xml:id="pg_146" facs="0178"/>effects on surrounding cities of attacks on
                        naval bases are included in the estimates.)</p>
                    <p>The assumed number of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites
                        varies between the optimistic cases (in which the low end of the range is
                        used) and the pessimistic cases (in which the high end is used). Therefore,
                        the percentages shown should not be interpreted as representing fractions of
                        the same numbers.</p>

                    <p>The direct comparison of force numbers as such is less important than the
                        ways in which we base and operate our forces. For example, we could
                        out-number the Soviets three to one in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                        >ICBM</gloss>'s and still have an inadequate deterrent posture if our
                        missiles were soft and concentrated. However, the force increments which I
                        am recommending are all in a protected mode, hard and dispersed, or
                        mobile.</p>
                    <p>Given a well protected posture, relative numbers are still important for
                        several reasons: <list>

                                dispersal and make it possible for the Soviets to destroy most our

                        </list></p>
                    <p>Therefore, we have no intention of letting ourselves be seriously
                        out-numbered in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s by the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>How many <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s will the Soviet Union have
                        in the mid-1960's? The answer is intrinsically uncertain because it is still
                        subject to Soviet decisions which may not yet have been made, and which will
                        be influenced by our own decisions. However, we do know a good deal about
                        their posture today. We are able to estimate that the Soviets now have from
                        25 to 50 operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers. Their
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> build-up appears to be
                        deliberately paced, not a crash program. On the basis of what has been
                        observed so far, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] the Soviets will have from 200 to 400 <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s in mid-1964. But even if the most
                        pessimistic (Air Force) estimates prove to be valid, in mid-1964 we will
                        still equal the Soviet Union in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s at
                        about 850 each. This will be combined with a substantial U.S. superiority in
                        all other categories of long range nuclear delivery systems.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, if the Soviet Union exceeds our most pessimistic estimates and
                        builds up a much larger force by 1965 or 1967, we are confident that we will
                        find out about it in time to expand our program appropriately. As a hedge
                        against this unlikely possibility, we are expanding our Minuteman production
                        capacity to over 60 missiles a <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0181"
                        />month. When this is done, the lead time for hard and dispersed Minuteman
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s will be about 26 months.
                        Therefore, we will have a great deal of flexibility to expand the program at
                        a later date if it should prove to be necessary to do so.</p>
                    <p>In other categories of long range nuclear delivery systems, we will have a
                        substantial superiority. Soviet long range aviation now comprises about
                        1,000 medium bombers (or tankers), and about 150 heavy bombers (or tankers),
                        equipped with air-to-surface missiles. The heavy bomber category is far more
                        significant than the medium bomber category. We will have 630 heavy bombers,
                        plus almost as many tankers. Because the Soviets would have to use some of
                        their bombers as tankers, this will mean an effective U.S. heavy bomber
                        force approximately four or more times as large as that of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has about 20 conventionally
                        powered submarines which are probably capable of launching short-range
                        ballistic missiles (approximately 150-300 nautical miles), though not while
                        submerged. By 1963, the Soviets could probably introduce nuclear powered
                        submarines with a submerged launch system employing medium range ballistic
                        missiles. There is no evidence to suggest that the Soviets have a program
                        approaching our Polaris program, either in size or quality.</p>

                            Weapon System Choices</hi></p>
                    <p>Within the general quantitative requirements for additional long range
                        nuclear delivery systems, suggested by the above considerations, the
                        following are the reasons for my specific program recommendations:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">B-52's</hi></p>
                    <p>The Air Force has proposed the procurement of 52 additional B-52's (45 wing
                        unit equipment plus 7 command support) with <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1962 funds. The cost of procuring and operating these
                        aircraft, with (30) associated tankers and Skybolt missiles, for a 5 year
                        period would be about $1.4 billions. My reasons for recommending against
                        this procurement are the following: <list>

                            <item>We already have a large force of intercontinental bombers. In
                                mid-1965 it will comprise 630 B-52's, 80 B-58's and, if we do not
                                decide to phase them out sooner, 225 B-47's. The alert B-52's and
                                B-58's alone will be able to carry about 1500 bombs plus 1,000 air
                                launched missiles. The alert B-47's will be able to carry another

                            <item>An examination of the target system shows that most targets, and
                                all of those of the highest priority, are best attacked by missiles;
                                first, because the targets are soft, fixed, and of known location,
                                and therefore vulnerable to missile attack; and second, in the case
                                of the military targets, the missiles reach their targets much
                                faster than do bombers, and therefore would be more effective in
                                catching enemy bombers and missiles on the ground; and third, our
                                missile systems have a much greater survival potential and endurance
                                in the wartime environment, and therefore can be used with more
                                control and deliberation.</item>

                            <item>The bombers are soft and concentrated and they depend upon warning
                                and quick response for their survival under attack. This is a less
                                reliable means of protection than hardening and dispersal or
                                mobility. Moreover, it means that the bombers must be committed to
                                attack very early in the war and cannot be held in reserve to be
                                used in a controlled and deliberate way.</item>

                            <item>Bombers are expensive. For the same cost (in total five year
                                system costs) as a wing of B-52's with tankers and Skybolts, we can
                                buy 250 Minutemen hardened and dispersed, or 6 Polaris
                                submarines.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">GAM-87 Skybolt</hi></p>
                    <p>Air defense studies indicate that the most effective means for penetrating
                        air defenses are low altitude penetration and defense suppression, both of
                        which are more effective than attempting to out-run the defenses at high
                        altitude. The Skybolt is intended to provide a major improvement in the
                        penetration capability of the programmed B-52 force at a relatively low
                        cost. The 800 Skybolt missiles on alert bombers ought to be able to overcome
                        almost any Soviet defense and make it possible for the bombers to go into
                        their targets and attack them with gravity bombs. The total cost for 1150
                        Skybolts for the period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962-1967 is
                        estimated to be $1.6 billion.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">KC-135</hi></p>
                    <p>Twenty-seven squadrons of KC-135's (540 operational aircraft) have been
                        procured through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962. Air Force studies
                        indicate that 800 KC-135's are required, with most of the increment going to
                        support the B-52 force. (About 70 KC-135's are required to support <gloss
                            target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss>, 20 for command posts, and 80 to support
                        the B-58 fleet.) However, beyond approximately 470 tankers, more KC-135 are
                        not required to enable the B-52's to reach their targets. Rather, the basis
                        for the Air Force stated requirement for more tankers is to improve the
                        ability of the bombers to penetrate enemy defenses by allowing them to
                        choose more favorable routes or to fly more at low altitude. Improved
                        penetration capability achieved this way and Skybolt for defense suppression
                        are not both required. Moreover, Skybolt appears to be more effective.
                        Therefore, in my judgment, the expenditure of approximately $1.1 billions to
                        procure 160 extra tankers and operate them for 5 years is not required. The
                        force of 640 tankers which I recommend will provide 470 to support the
                        B-52's; 80 for the B-58's; 70 to support <gloss target="#t_TAC1"

                    <p>The 18 extra Titan missiles proposed by the Air Force would cost
                        approximately $372 millions to procure and operate for 5 years. The Titan II
                        has a substantially larger payload than Minuteman. It will be able to

                        Minuteman hard and dispersed. At equal cost, four Minutemen are to be <pb
                            n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0183"/>preferred to one Titan because,
                        first, they are less vulnerable, and second, they provide more target
                        coverage. Moreover, we already plan to have a substantial force of Atlas and
                        Titan which should be adequate for those special purposes requiring large
                        payloads. Therefore I do not recommend procurement of additional Titans.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Minuteman Hard and Dispersed</hi></p>
                    <p>Minuteman H &amp; D has the lowest system cost of any of our <gloss

                        year costs. It is clearly the preferred way to acquire more <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s. However, I am not recommending that we
                        procure more than 100 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 because our
                        over-all force requirements do not make it necessary. The difference between
                        the Air Force proposed procurement of 600 missiles in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1963 and the 100 I am recommending, in 5 year system costs,
                        is approximately $2.75 billions.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Mobile Minuteman</hi></p>
                    <p>Mobile Minuteman would serve as a hedge against our being heavily outnumbered
                        by the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force, a low Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>, or unexpected failure of the
                        hardened Minuteman to meet estimated blast resistance—conditions lowering
                        the survival potential of hard and dispersed Minutemen. It would also serve
                        as a hedge against unexpected advances in Soviet anti-submarine warfare
                        capability that would reduce the security of Polaris. However, Mobile
                        Minuteman may have troubles of its own, including wartime fallout (which may
                        reduce substantially its wartime endurance), peacetime sabotage and
                        espionage and operational problems associated with the transport of
                        explosives and attempted random operation. Moreover, if we were to complete
                        the Air Force recommended program of 300 Mobile Minutemen, Mobile Minuteman
                        would cost about 2.5 times as much per missile as Minuteman hard and
                        dispersed.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we are not yet certain that Mobile Minuteman will be required. The
                        action I am recommending is in the nature of lead time reduction on the
                        missile production program. If the combination of contingencies favoring
                        Mobile Minuteman does not occur, I shall reconsider the decision and
                        recommend cancellation of the production program.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Polaris</hi></p>
                    <p>This system has the most survival potential in the wartime environment of any
                        of our long range nuclear delivery systems. Polaris missiles do not have to
                        be launched early in the war, they can be held in reserve and used in a
                        controlled and deliberate way to achieve our wartime objectives. For
                        example, Polaris is ideal for counter-city retaliation. However, as the
                        calculations shown above indicate, the force already programmed is large and
                        can cause great damage to the population and industry of the Soviet Union.
                        This reduces the urgency of more Polaris missiles. Consequently, I recommend
                        that we procure 6 more Polaris submarines in <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                                44</ref>.</note> you inquired regarding the reaction time of Soviet
                        medium range and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Reaction times of the
                        Soviet operational ballistic missiles deployed to fixed sites have been
                        estimated on the basis of alternative conditions of alert or readiness.
                        These times are believed to be approximately the same for the three classes
                        of missiles now operational (the 700 n.m. and 1,100 n.m. <gloss
                            target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>; the 5,000/7,000 n.m. <gloss

                            target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>, which is estimated to become operational
                        late this year or early next. These missiles have quite similar
                        characteristics. Each is liquid-fueled, has radio-inertial guidance, and is

                        complete support facilities. In general, reaction time is dependent upon the
                        prevailing political and military situation, which determines the alert
                        status of the missile force. Three conditions of alert are postulated:</p>

                    <p>There is some evidence that rapid reaction time has been a Soviet objective.
                        It is not possible to determine the condition of readiness of Soviet missile
                        launchers at any given time.</p>
                    <p>2. Salvo times will vary according to the type of missile and the handling
                        capability of the associated radio-inertial guidance system. For all
                        classes, a successful salvo includes those missiles launched within 15-30
                        minutes of the scheduled time.</p>
                    <p>3. Available information indicates that all Soviet missile launchers have a
                        refire capability. Assuming that the launching facilities are not damaged by
                        accident or by attack, a second <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> could
                        be launched from the same pad in about 16 hours. Two additional missiles are
                        estimated probably available for each <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>
                        launcher and a second salvo could be launched about 4 to 6 hours after the
                        first.</p>

                    <p>The question whether the Nike Zeus anti-missile system should be deployed has
                        been under consideration for several years. I have now decided to recommend
                        that funds be included in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '63 budget
                        for Nike Zeus production support. This would make possible its limited
                        deployment in the near future. The Joint Chiefs of Staff support this
                        recommendation.</p>
                    <p>A recent technical analysis has confirmed that Nike Zeus will not provide
                        soft targets an effective defense against large scale or sophisticated
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attacks. A purely technical
                        appraisal would not lead to a recommendation for deployment of a weapon
                        system with so limited an operational effectiveness. This has been the
                        conclusion of past technical evaluations; the current review has revealed no
                        important new technical factors.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the following considerations appear, in my judgment, to
                        favor a limited deployment of Zeus: <list>

                                balanced against the expectation that the Soviets will make some
                                errors in the design of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                                force and have technical, organizational, and resource difficulties
                                which could limit the capabilities of this force. Our own experience
                                with the development and deployment of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                    >ICBM</gloss> forces has provided examples of such

                            <item>The existence of a deployed defense may substantially increase the
                                degree of uncertainty at the Soviet decision-making level. The
                                offense will find it more difficult to be certain that weaknesses do
                                not exist which may have been discovered by the defense. Recent
                                evidence indicates that existing warheads on our ballistic missiles
                                are subject to destruction at fairly large distances by nuclear
                                detonations. Though this would not in fact make Nike Zeus effective
                                against planned U.S. missile systems, it is an example of the
                                unpredictable elements involved.</item>

                                ratio is unfavorable to the defense. This may take the form of extra

                                systems or the introduction of sophisticated reentry vehicles with

                                ballistic missile defense appear to be more ambitious than our own
                                efforts. Even if U.S. scientists can offer claims of a U.S.

                        </list></p>
                    <p>These factors are sufficiently compelling to recommend a limited deployment
                        of the Nike Zeus system. An operational capability can be obtained starting
                        in 1965 and, although other city-defense systems of somewhat greater
                        capability are feasible by about 1970, none of the current proposals
                        provides assurance of a truly effective defense of cities. It should be
                        recognized that deployment of any active city defense (including Nike Zeus)
                        presupposes a system of civilian fall-out shelters.</p>
                    <p>There is at least one danger in deployment of a defense system of doubtful
                        effectiveness such as Nike Zeus: the Executive Branch of the government, the
                        Congress, and the people may develop an unwarranted faith in its capability
                        to deter a Soviet attack or to mitigate its consequences if full-scale
                        nuclear warfare is initiated.</p>

                        the US vis-à-vis those of the Soviet Union has been accomplished. This
                        comparison has been limited to two time periods, viz., 1 October 1961 and 1
                        July 1963. US forces in this comparison include those forces based in the
                            <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> and those deployed overseas
                        which have the capability of striking the Sino-Soviet Bloc. No Allied forces
                        have been included. Soviet forces include those capable of striking the US
                        and US forces overseas.</p>

                    <p>3. A comprehensive evaluation of the relative posture of the US vis-a-vis the
                        Soviet Union requires that many factors be considered. One of these factors,
                        and probably the most difficult to assess, is the intention of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Critical to the Soviet judgment is the
                        number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s they possess. Their three
                        to five fold increase in this category during this period will materially
                        improve their capability to inflict serious damage upon the US. However,
                        based on the above intelligence estimates of Soviet nuclear delivery assets,
                        the US enjoys a military superiority over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> in both 1961 and 1963. Relatively speaking, the
                        superiority is not as great in 1961 as it will be in 1963 because of the
                        increased build-up of hardened US missile sites beginning in late 1961. In
                        the critical period of decision between the present and mid 1963, the
                        decisive superiority of US nuclear delivery capability would strongly
                        influence the Soviet Union not to deliberately initiate general war. After
                        this time, the increasing nuclear delivery capability including additional
                        US hardened and mobile missiles will further decrease the likelihood of a
                        deliberate Soviet nuclear attack.</p>
                    <p>4. In summary, as of 1 October 1961, despite a strong Soviet military
                        posture, the relative strategic balance of forces is in favor of the US, and
                        it is doubtful, except through miscalculation or misadventure, that the
                        Soviets would initiate general war. In 1962, our strategic force levels and
                        our relatively secure strategic weapon systems assure for the US a decisive
                        retaliatory capability that makes it even less likely that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would risk initiating general war.
                        However, there is good evidence that the Soviets in recognition of the above
                        imbalance are striving for weapon systems that will, in the future, provide
                        them with a distinct military <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0190"
                        />advantage. It is estimated that these research and development efforts
                        will be in the AICBM defense system and in the military application of space
                            vehicles.<note n="2" target="d49fn2">In a memorandum to <persName

                    <p>I recently completed a preliminary review of the Department of Defense <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'63 Budget and a projection of the
                        Department's Programs for the years 1963-67. Based on this review, I have
                        reached certain tentative conclusions regarding force levels. The detailed
                        financial budgets for the Department are now being prepared, based on these
                        conclusions, and <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0191"/>will be submitted
                        to you on December 1 for approval. In the meantime, you may wish to review
                        the major elements of the budget which I propose to recommend—the purpose of
                        this memorandum is to outline those elements for you.</p>
                    <p>We have divided the budget into the following nine programs corresponding to
                        broad mission areas or to support areas that cannot be allocated to the
                            forces:<note n="1" xml:id="d50fn1">Only the first six sections are

                    <p>The budget has been prepared on the assumption that the Berlin Crisis will
                        have eased by the beginning of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'63.
                        Alternative plans are being prepared on other assumptions.</p>
                    <p>The costs of the program I am recommending, and the difference between the
                        costs of that program and those recommended by the individual Services are
                        shown in the following table. As the table indicates, the Services proposals
                        average about $15 billion per year, or about $74 billion over the period
                        1963-67, more than the programs I am recommending.</p>

                        and supporting forces, with a total strength of approximately 74,000 men,
                        called to active duty on October 15, 1961.</p>
                    <p>As the table indicates, the manning levels I am recommending are lower than
                        the Service proposals for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963. In part,
                        this is because my recommended programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1963 call for fewer combat units than the Service proposals.
                        It also reflects my judgment that unit manning levels slightly lower than
                        those proposed by the Services are adequate.</p>
                    <p>Because a program review of this character and the establishment of a
                        five-year program is an innovation in the Department of Defense, many of the
                        cost estimates used in arriving at these totals are approximate, and in some
                        cases high. They will be carefully refined during the budget review in
                        October and November, and I expect the totals to be reduced somewhat.
                        Moreover, until the program is actually executed, it is to be considered as
                        tentative and for planning purposes only, and I will recommend changes as
                        circumstances demand. I believe, nevertheless, that it is important to have
                        at all times a framework of realistic 5-10 year programs, however tentative,
                        to insure that the Services and agencies of the Department are working on
                        common assumptions in conformity with national policy and objectives.</p>
                    <p>In this memorandum, I discuss the force levels I am recommending, and the
                        reasons for my decisions, program by program. The tables which introduce
                        each section summarize my recommendations. In those cases in which the
                        program I am recommending differ from those proposed by the Services, the
                        latter are shown in red beneath mine.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">Printed in
                            italics.</note></p>
                    <p>[Here follow a table and notes identical to the table entitled “Recommended
                        Forces” in <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.]</p>
                    <p>In addition to these forces, I will recommend at a later date that the Air
                        Force be authorized to procure and operate a secure command and <pb n="162"
                            xml:id="pg_162" facs="0194"/>control system for <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss>. Except for 20 KC-135's which will be available for use as
                        airborne command posts, the cost of this system has not been included in the
                        figures on page 2.</p>
                    <p>The forces I am recommending have been chosen to provide the United States
                        with the capability, in the event of deliberate Soviet nuclear attack to do
                        the following: first, to strike back against Soviet bomber bases, missile
                        sites, and other installations associated with long-range nuclear forces in
                        order to reduce Soviet power and limit the damage that can be done to us by
                        vulnerable Soviet follow-on forces; while, second, to hold in protected
                        reserve forces capable of destroying Soviet urban society, if necessary, in
                        a controlled and deliberate way. With the recommended forces, I am confident
                        that we will be able, at all times, to deny the Soviet Union the prospect of
                        either a military victory or of knocking out the U.S. retaliatory force.</p>
                    <p>The forces I am recommending will provide major improvements in the quality
                        of our strategic posture: in its survivability, its flexibility, and its
                        ability to be used in a controlled and deliberate way under a wide range of
                        contingencies.</p>
                    <p>Over the five years 1963-67, the cost of the aircraft and missiles
                        recommended by the Air Force and the Polaris recommended by the Navy exceeds
                        the cost of the forces I am recommending by approximately $10 billion.
                        However, the extra capability provided by the individual Service proposals
                        runs up against strongly diminishing returns and yields very little in terms
                        of target destruction. In my judgment, it is not an increment worth the cost
                        of $10 billion over the five year period.</p>
                    <p>Because of the special importance of these forces, I am including a detailed
                        analysis of their capabilities as Appendix I to this report.<note n="3"

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Basis for Recommendation</hi></p>
                    <p>The existing continental air defense system is based on a concept developed
                        in the early 1950's and was designed to meet the threat anticipated in the
                        mid and late 1950's, that is, mass raids of many hundreds of bombers. By
                        itself, it is inadequate to defend the United States in the mid-1960's
                        because it deals with only part of the threat. Moreover, two developments
                        have rendered it inappropriate as an anti-bomber defense system for the
                        mid-1960's—the mass bomber threat has failed to materialize, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> has become the major danger.</p>
                    <p>It now appears that the largest likely raid size that we might have to face
                        will be on the order of 200 to 300 bombers. This is a consequence of several
                        factors, including, first, the size of the Soviet bomber force which now
                        comprises about 150 heavy bombers and about 1,000 medium bombers, many of
                        which would have to serve as tankers; second, the problems facing the
                        Soviets in avoiding giving us advance warning of attack by large-scale
                        bomber activities; and third, the fact that we will have a large Minuteman
                        force capable of destroying the Soviet bomber bases and the aircraft on
                        them, thus cutting off follow-up attacks after the first wave.</p>
                    <p>The present anti-bomber air defense system is highly vulnerable to <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attack. Its control is centralized in 22
                        soft direction centers, 8 of which are on <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss> bases. By diverting a small fraction of their <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force to defense suppression, the Soviets
                        could effectively paralyze our air defense system. Moreover, of the 38 air
                        defense interceptor bases in the U.S., 25 are co-located with <gloss
                            target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>. Thus most of our air defense system would
                        be destroyed as a by-product of a missile attack on <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, I believe the anti-bomber air defense system should be
                        reoriented, to the maximum extent possible, to give it a capability <pb
                            n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0196"/>to survive <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> attack, by such means as back-up control and dispersal of
                        interceptors, while sacrificing to some extent its capacity to deal with
                        mass raids.</p>
                    <p>The existing air defense system does not defend against two major parts of
                        the nuclear threat to the United States: fallout and ballistic missiles.
                        Without adequate fallout protection, any attempt at active defense of the
                        population of the U.S. is doomed to failure. For example, without fallout
                        protection, even a missile attack on <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                        that avoided cities would probably result in the deaths of 50 to 100 million
                        Americans. Therefore, a major fallout protection program should have high
                        priority, and we propose to utilize the major portion of the $400 million
                        budgeted for Civil Defense for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The problem of anti-ballistic missile defenses is complex and difficult. It
                        is clear that an impenetrable defense is not feasible at any reasonable
                        cost. There are too many advantages on the side of the offense. However,
                        short of that unattainable goal, a limited anti-ballistic missile defense
                        can achieve some very useful benefits for the United States, including
                        improved protection of key decision centers from surprise missile attack,
                        reduced vulnerability to accidental missile launching, etc. Therefore, I am
                        recommending procurement and deployment of Nike-Zeus defenses for six
                        cities, at a cost of approximately $3.5 billions over the period 1963-1967.
                        The reasons underlying this recommendation are discussed in detail in
                        Appendix II to this report.<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4"><ref target="#d48"

                    <p>b Army procurement includes that required for Reserve and National Guard, and
                        a small amount for Continental Air Defense.</p>

                    <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0198"/>
                    <p>The recommendations shown above assume that the immediate danger of conflict
                        over Berlin will have moderated by next summer and the reserve units called
                        to active duty for this contingency can be returned to inactive status.</p>
                    <p>To meet the Berlin crisis, it was necessary to increase the forces by
                        calling-up reserves and by retaining weapon systems previously scheduled for
                        phase-out. Often only small improvements in effectiveness resulted from
                        these increases. For <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 to <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967, effectiveness can be increased more
                        efficiently by improving quality rather than increasing quantity.
                        Furthermore, reserve units returned to inactive status will be available for
                        another emergency with improved readiness resulting from their current tours
                        of active duty, and from the “reserve readiness improvement program”.</p>
                    <p>In reviewing the Service proposals, one of my objectives has been to direct
                        effort towards the creation of more effective non-nuclear forces that will
                        widen the range of military actions open to the United States in future
                        international crises.</p>
                    <p>The broad policies I propose for strengthening our conventional capabilities
                        are as follows: (1) to concentrate on improving the equipment of the Army
                        and the readiness of Selected Army reserve forces rather than undertaking a
                        major increase in size of the active Army; (2) to strengthen our land based
                        tactical air, which is now seriously inadequate for support of the ground
                        forces; (3) to maintain a Navy which, together with the Naval forces of our
                        allies, will continue the effective control of the seas we now
                        possess—especially in a non-nuclear conflict.</p>
                    <p>The following sections summarize my major recommendations for the General
                        Purpose Forces of each Service.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Army</hi></p>
                    <p>The Army proposed a force of 16 divisions, 8 brigades, and an end fiscal 1963
                        active personnel strength of 1,092,700. I recommend 14 divisions, 7
                        brigades, and a 1963 personnel strength of 929,000. The force proposed by
                        the Army would cost approximately $860 million per year more than the
                        strength which I recommend. While the number of divisions in my recommended
                        force would be the same as in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961, Army
                        personnel would be 52,000 greater. This increase would permit three major
                        changes.</p>
                    <p>First, the three active divisions which, prior to the Berlin crisis trained
                        recruits, would remain free of these duties and be retained in a combat
                        ready status. As a result, there would be six Army divisions in the U.S.
                        available for immediate deployment, rather than the pre-Berlin three, and
                        all 14 active divisions would be combat ready. In my judgment, the six U.S.
                        based active divisions and the priority National Guard divisions would
                        provide an adequate strategic reserve for deployment to limited war theaters
                        or for initial augmentation of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        forces.</p>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0199"/>
                    <p>Second, two separate airborne brigades, one for the Pacific and one for
                        Europe, will be activated to provide increased theater reserves.</p>
                    <p>Third, recent increases in the training establishment will be maintained to
                        provide a basis for the rapid future expansion of the active Army. In
                        addition, the Army will be reorganized under the <gloss target="#t_ROAD1"
                            >ROAD</gloss> 65 concept to increase its flexibility for meeting a wide
                        variety of combat situations throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the procurement of Army equipment, I recommend a level of $2.6
                        billion. This is about the same level as in the post-Berlin <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘62 budget, and about $1 billion more than in
                        the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘62 budget proposed by the previous
                        administration. It is, however, $900 million less than the amount requested
                        by the Army and supported by the Joint Chiefs.</p>
                    <p>The $2.6 billion I recommend reflects three judgments. First, the procurement
                        of nuclear systems for the Army should be maintained at approximately the
                        level of recent budgets rather than increased as the Army proposes. Second,
                        all non-nuclear items of equipment representing a significant advance in
                        performance can be procured at reasonable rates within a $2.6 billion
                        funding level. Third, Army inventories should be maintained at a level
                        adequate to support 88 division-months of combat operations, as will be
                        discussed further on page 15.<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">Reference is to the
                            section below entitled "Logistic Guidance."</note></p>
                    <p>As noted in the discussion of the Research and Development Program, I
                        recommend large increases in the research program for non-nuclear weapons.
                        These increases should result in substantial progress in this critical area.
                        The guidance issued to the Army indicates that the level of $2.6 billion for
                        materiel will be increased if required to procure markedly superior items
                        when they become available.</p>

                    <p>For combat ships, I recommend returning to the pre-Berlin force levels. This
                        will mean a force of 15 rather than 16 attack carriers and 9 rather than 10
                        anti-submarine carriers, and a return to inactive status of the aircraft and
                        destroyers called from the reserves. The Joint Chiefs also recommend a force
                        of 15 attack carriers, but otherwise favor retention of the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘62 force levels for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63. My recommendation reflects the view that these
                        additional Naval forces, which would cost $200 million in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63, would provide only a small increase in
                        the combat effectiveness of our Armed Forces.</p>
                    <p>For logistics and amphibious ships, however, I recommend (as do the Navy and
                        Joint Chiefs) that the ships added to the active fleet<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d50fn6">These ships were obtained either by recommissioning from
                            the Reserve Fleet or by retaining ships previously scheduled for
                            phase-out. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘62 be retained for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63. The 13 additional logistics ships will permit a much
                        needed increase in the flexibility of fleet operations. The 26 <pb n="168"
                            xml:id="pg_168" facs="0200"/>amphibious ships will continue to provide
                        transport and an assault landing capability for one Marine division in each
                        ocean. By late <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63 the Marines also will
                        have in each ocean a capability for landing 1/3 of a division by helicopter.
                        This represents a considerable increase in mobility from the pre-Berlin
                        period when amphibious lift was limited to one division in the Pacific and
                        1/2 of a division in the Atlantic, and included much less capability for
                        helicopter landings.</p>
                    <p>With respect to shipbuilding, my recommended program includes a
                        conventionally powered attack carrier to be funded in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63. This ship will replace one of the smaller carriers in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘67, and will provide a considerably
                        improved capability for operating high performance aircraft. The Joint
                        Chiefs did not reach an agreed position on building this carrier. The Chiefs
                        of Staff of both the Army and Air Force questioned the advisability of
                        funding a carrier in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63.</p>
                    <p>The Navy proposed that this carrier and a number of other large surface
                        combatant ships in its <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63-‘67 building
                        program be nuclear powered (the incremental construction cost of nuclear
                        power for a carrier amounts to about $100 million). I recommend nuclear
                        power for only one of these ships, a frigate to be funded in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63. This ship, together with the nuclear
                        powered ships built or building, will provide a one-carrier all-nuclear task
                        force to meet occasional specialized needs for increased endurance. With
                        this exception, I do not believe the extra expense of nuclear power for
                        surface ships is justified at this time. At present, a nuclear powered
                        surface ship costs on the average about 1-1/2 times as much to build and to
                        operate as a conventionally powered ship and offers only relatively minor
                        increases in effectiveness over its conventional counterpart. This is in
                        contrast to submarines where nuclear power has made possible an entirely new
                        mode of operations.</p>
                    <p>I am also recommending that conversions be substituted for some of the new
                        construction proposed by the Navy and amphibious ships and small destroyers.
                        These conversions offer an inexpensive way of obtaining an early increase in
                        capability. In contrast with the three to four year lead time for new ship
                        construction, conversions can be completed in a year or less.</p>
                    <p>My recommendations for procurement of Naval and Marine aircraft in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63 represent an increase of $172 million
                        over the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘62 level. It represents,
                        however, a reduction of $975 million from the Navy <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63 proposal. In my judgment, the increase over <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘62 that I am recommending will provide an
                        adequate level of Naval air power.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Air Force</hi></p>
                    <p>Neither the Air Force nor the Joint Chiefs propose retaining in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63 the Air National Guard tactical squadrons
                        now on active duty. These squadrons have aircraft of lower performance than
                        regular Air Force squadrons and are generally less effective relative to
                        their cost. I recommend <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0201"/>that these
                        squadrons be released from active duty after the Berlin issue has been
                        resolved.</p>
                    <p>The Air Force proposes adding only 150 aircraft to the pre-Berlin levels of
                        1,179 squadron aircraft.<note n="7" xml:id="d50fn7">Numbers cited in this
                            section are for squadron aircraft only. In addition, aircraft would be
                            procured for command support, training, test and attrition. [Footnote in
                            the source text.]</note> This is not enough aircraft. One of the
                        weaknesses revealed by the Berlin crisis has been a shortage of tactical
                        aircraft in a non-nuclear conflict. The 1,329 aircraft proposed by the Air
                        Force would provide about 80 aircraft per division (or its brigade
                        equivalent) for the Army's 14 divisions and 7 brigades. In contrast, Marine
                        Division-Wing Teams have about 180 tactical aircraft. Furthermore, Marine
                        aircraft have only close support of ground troops as their primary mission,
                        whereas Air Force fighter-bombers have three major missions: air
                        superiority, long-range interdiction, and close support. Finally, aircraft
                        have long lead times so that procurement cannot be postponed until a crisis.
                        I recommend, therefore, a procurement program that will raise the total in
                        squadron service by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘66 to about 1,580
                        aircraft, 250 more than proposed by the Air Force.</p>
                    <p>The number of aircraft required is closely related to the type of aircraft to
                        be procured. The Air Force favors exclusive reliance on the multi-purpose
                        fighter-bomber. This aircraft type costs at least twice as much to buy and
                        operate as the single-purpose close support type. Substituting single
                        purpose aircraft on a two for one basis for some of the multi-purpose types
                        would provide a larger mixed force for the same over-all cost. It is
                        important, however, that a mixed force of this kind contain sufficient
                        aircraft capable of air superiority and deep interdiction missions, as well
                        as close support. With these considerations in mind, I recommend a force of
                        about 1,580 tactical aircraft, consisting of 400 single purpose close
                        support aircraft and 1,180 multi-purpose fighters (738 of which are F-105's,
                        the newest of the multi-purpose aircraft). The Air Force program would have
                        provided only 1,330 multi-purpose aircraft including 882 F-105's.</p>
                    <p>For aerial tactical reconnaissance and surveillance, I recommend that the
                        funds proposed by the Air Force be included in the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63 budget. However, I am directing the Air Force to submit
                        a new program which will better meet the needs of both the Army and Air
                        Force for reconnaissance and surveillance.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Logistic Guidance</hi></p>
                    <p>I have also directed that revised logistic assumptions be used by the
                        Services in preparing their budgets. The new general planning base for all
                        three Services is designed to provide logistical support for an average of 6
                        calendar months of a major conventional war. For the supply of the <pb
                            n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0202"/>forces beyond six months, we shall
                        rely largely upon industrial production.</p>
                    <p>We now have a serious imbalance in the inventories of the three Services and
                        among the items of any one Service. The six calendar month objective will be
                        consistently applied to all items and all Services, but with modifications
                        to reflect the deployment patterns of each. Because of time required to
                        commit the entire force, six calendar months of combat requires fewer months
                        of full combat support.</p>
                    <p>For the Army, the new guidance of 88 division months of combat operation is
                        based upon a 22 Division force engaged for four combat months in a
                        conventional war.</p>
                    <p>For the Marines, a force of 4 Divisions would be provided logistical support
                        for 20 division months of combat operations.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the Navy, the comparable support for 6 calendar months assumes
                        an average of approximately 50 per cent of the active fleet engaged in
                        combat during the same period.</p>
                    <p>A serious imbalance has existed between the logistic planning for the ground
                        forces and their necessary tactical air support. The logistic guidance for
                        tactical air support is now to be consistent with that for the ground units
                        they should support. As an interim objective for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63, the Air Force is being directed to acquire a minimum on
                        hand capability of at least three months of combat support. In view of the
                        grave deficiencies in non-nuclear ordnance for tactical aircraft, I am
                        recommending the specific inclusion of $500 million in the <gloss

                        program and that of the Air Force in 1965- 1967 reflects a more conservative
                        estimate of date of availability, not a difference in program objectives.
                        The eventual total I am recommending is lower than that proposed by the Air
                        Force because I am including a fleet of Cargo Jets in my program.</p>

                        requirements for limited war in remote areas: <list>

                    <p>In addition, continued logistic support of the permanent theatre forces would
                        have to be provided. (A two division amphibious lift for the Marine Corps
                        was provided in Package III.)</p>
                    <p>At present our potential military response is constrained by the limited
                        capability of the current airlift forces and by the current basing and
                        support posture, and is not able to meet the above objectives. My
                        recommendations for meeting this deficiency are to increase both the airlift
                        forces and the theatre stocks of vehicles and consumables.</p>
                    <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0204"/>
                    <p>Pre-stocking of theatre supply points, and airlift directly from the United
                        States, are close substitutes in terms of providing quickly the equipment
                        and supplies needed for combat operations in remote areas. Current
                        deployment concepts, implicit in the Service objectives, specify the airlift
                        and sealift of the above forces from the continental United States. While
                        there are advantages to this concept, an airlift force with four times the
                        current capability would be needed to meet our requirements.</p>
                    <p>By using theatre stockage, however, we can greatly increase the effective
                        capabilities of the airlift and sealift forces. Nevertheless, for a variety
                        of reasons we cannot afford to rely completely on this approach. The airlift
                        and sealift forces I am recommending, therefore, reflect a choice to use
                        theatre stocks whenever possible, but also to provide a substantial
                        capability for deployment from the United States in the event those stocks
                        cannot be used or have not been established. The cost of this pre-stockage
                        program would be only about 10 per cent of that needed to procure and
                        operate the additional aircraft required under an all-United States
                        deployment concept.</p>
                    <p>The recommended program is designed to meet all of the objectives listed
                        above. A capability is provided to deploy one airborne division to the
                        Middle East or Southeast Asia within seven days, if a one brigade force from
                        this division plus resupply for the full division is airlifted from the
                        theatre. Alternatively, one division can be deployed from the United States
                        to any area within ten days, with no support from theatre resources.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these general conclusions, certain aspects of the recommended
                        forces deserve special comment:</p>
                    <p>The recommended program brings into the force at a relatively early point
                        substantial numbers of additional transport aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Airlift squadrons are shifted from the high utilization-high cost air
                        transport force where they are surplus to our requirements to the lower cost
                        troop carrier force. Peak short-response readiness is thereby improved while
                        appreciable savings in operating costs are achieved.</p>
                    <p>Construction of 5 Comet roll-on/roll-off ships at the rate of one a year is
                        begun in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63. When deliveries begin in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘65, each will replace one general
                        purpose cargo ship now in the active fleet. This will give us a new and
                        valuable capability for rapid loading and unloading of vehicles,
                        particularly where port facilities are limited.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the balance of the cargo, tanker, and troop ship fleet, I see
                        no need at this time for the construction of replacement vessels. The
                        marginal gains which might be achieved because of their faster cruising
                        speed are completely outweighed by the very substantial expenditure
                        involved. When needed, the service life of the existing vessels can be
                        extended by a “FRAM-type” overhaul program.</p>
                    <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0205"/>
                    <p>I have been unable to identify a military contingency for which the strategic
                        sealift of troops would be necessary or desirable. In an emergency our
                        commercial air fleet alone could airlift more troops than our forces are
                        prepared to deploy. Deployment by air would also provide a faster initial
                        response and shorter transit time.</p>
                    <p>In routine peacetime operations the movement of almost all personnel overseas
                        by air could result in direct financial savings. Furthermore, the
                        effectiveness of our forces would be augmented by providing the equivalent
                        of 10-15,000 more man years through reduced transit and collection time. I
                        am considering therefore, the retirement of all 16 troop ships now in the
                        active fleet.</p>

                    <p>For the Navy, I recommend an increase of $10 million above the 1962 level for
                        operation and maintenance of the ships to be returned from active to reserve
                        status. The Marine Corps program provides an increase of 5,000 in paid drill
                        personnel to strengthen the Reserve Marine Division/Wing Team and to provide
                        general augmentation of the active Fleet Marine Forces during a crisis. With
                        these expectations, the program I recommend continues the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘62 levels of obligational and paid drill
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>The recent Reserve call-ups have prevented my making decisions on the details
                        of the Reserve and National Guard programs for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63 or developing a firm program for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1964 to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967. I recommend,
                        however, the placing of greater emphasis on the readiness of high priority
                        units needed for immediate augmentation of the active forces during periods
                        of increased international tension. Furthermore, I intend to ensure that the
                        improved readiness of units released from active duty is maintained.</p>

                    <p>About 20 percent of the total <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> R&amp;D
                        dollars are currently programmed for space projects and systems through
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964. Although the levels appear to
                        decline beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964, new developments or
                        success in current programs could actually result in increases. Funds for

                        Program are included in these areas.</p>
                    <p>The costs for the Atlantic and Pacific Missile Ranges comprise about
                        one-quarter of the space R&amp;D funds. Large current R&amp;D programs are
                        Discoverer, Midas, Samos and Advent, a communications satellite.

                        important militarily. In the event that military requirements for manned
                        spaced vehicles were to appear substantial, increases in R&amp;D funding
                        could be required during the latter half of this decade.</p>

                            >FY</gloss> 1963 R&amp;D for missiles of all types represents about 30
                        per cent of the total R&amp;D budget. The fraction of the R&amp;D budget

                        1964 and subsequent years but the funding levels will probably not drop as
                        low as indicated. Some OSD Development Planning Increment funds will
                        undoubtedly be programmed into this area.</p>
                    <p>Strategic missile R&amp;D will decline rather sharply after <gloss

                        number of new programs anticipated in this area. Conceivably this decline
                        could be reversed if unexpected Soviet developments indicate much greater
                        vulnerability of, or lack of <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0209"

                        improve the penetration capabilities and reliability of those missiles still
                        in development. R&amp;D funds are also included for an improved longer range
                        Polaris and possible follow-on, for increased flexibility in Minuteman, to
                        retain the option of a decision for early deployment of mobile Minuteman,

                    <p>In a memorandum to you on 16 August 1961<note n="1" xml:id="d51fn1">In this
                            memorandum <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated
                            briefly many of the arguments set forth in the memorandum printed here.
                            In a memorandum for the record, dated August 21, Ewell reported that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> discussed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> Congressional
                            increases in funds for the B-52 bomber and other programs, and informed
                            him that the President hoped that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> could “find some formula by which the money
                            could be usefully employed” because <persName>Kennedy</persName> “was
                            under heavy political pressure to be forthcoming in this regard.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had indicated to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> that he was “very
                            firmly of the opinion that the money should not be spent for the
                            purposes in the bill, and that he could see no reason at this time to
                            change his position at a future date.” (National Defense University,
                            Taylor Papers, #11 Miscellaneous (H) 8)</note> I recommended that the
                        $514.5 million for additional long-range bombers, the $180 million
                        additional for the B-70, and the $85.8 million additional for Dynosoar,
                        appropriated by the Congress for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 not
                        be spent. Since that time, I have received and given careful consideration
                        to the report of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee. I have also completed
                        a review of U.S. requirements for long-range nuclear delivery systems, and
                        for military space research and development, as a part of a review of the
                        Defense program for the period 1963-1967. I remain convinced that the
                        additional appropriations should not be spent.</p>
                    <p>Let me make clear that my reason for recommending against the procurement of
                        an additional wing of long-range bombers is not a simple belief that bombers
                        are becoming obsolete, either because ballistic missiles are based on more
                        advanced technology, or because of prospective improvements in enemy air
                        defenses. Indeed, as the Stennis Committee report pointed out, bombers can
                        do things that missiles cannot do. As for enemy defenses, I am confident
                        that the capability for defense suppression provided by the 1,000
                        air-launched missiles to be carried by alert B-52's in my recommended
                        program will be more than enough to enable the bombers to penetrate. My main
                        reason for recommending against more bombers is that they are soft,
                        concentrated, and vulnerable to <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        attack, whereas I am convinced that most of our long-range nuclear delivery
                        forces must be either hard and dispersed or continuously mobile in
                        peacetime, both in order to be protected from surprise missile attack and to
                        have adequate survival potential in the wartime environment. We plan to
                        protect the bombers by warning and alert response. Besides its
                        “hair-trigger” aspects, this mechanism has other limitations, even if
                        successful. First, it leaves the non-alert half of the force unprotected.
                        Second, it leaves us no alternative but to commit essentially all of <pb
                            n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0211"/>the surviving bombers to attack in
                        the first few hours of the war or to lose their capability as they run out
                        of fuel and as their soft bases are destroyed. Moreover, the bombers have to
                        penetrate enemy defenses in large numbers and after “rolling back” the
                        defenses with missiles. They cannot be used in a selective and controlled
                        way.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, I believe that we should concentrate our procurement funds
                        for long-range nuclear delivery systems on hard and dispersed and mobile
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that we should not have a bomber force. Because of the
                        special things bombers can do, we should have a mix. But we already have a
                        large bomber force. In mid-1965, it will include 630 B-52's, 80 B-58's, and,
                        if we do not decide to phase them out sooner, 225 B-47's. The alert B-52's
                        and B-58's alone will be able to carry about 1,500 gravity bombs plus 1,000
                        air-launched missiles. The alert B-47's will be able to carry another 200
                        bombs. The B-52 and B-58 force will be able to be maintained substantially
                        intact at least until 1970. These bombers can give us more than enough
                        capability to perform the specialized tasks for which bombers are
                        particularly well suited.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, an examination of the target system shows that most targets,
                        including all those of highest priority are best attacked by missiles, for
                        several reasons. First, the existing targets are soft, fixed, and of known
                        location, and therefore vulnerable to missile attack (though often well
                        defended against bomber attack). Second, in the case of military targets,
                        the missiles get there faster than do bombers, and therefore would be more
                        effective in catching enemy bombers and missiles on the ground. Third, in
                        the case of attacks on Soviet cities, it is clearly desirable to have the
                        option to delay commitment, perhaps for many hours. For example, Polaris,
                        which can be held in reserve for days if necessary, is much better than a
                        bomber for this task.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, bombers are expensive particularly if kept on air-borne alert. The
                        total system cost over the next five years to which we would be committing
                        ourselves if we bought the extra B-52 wing plus supporting tankers and
                        air-launched missiles, would be approximately $1.4 billion (assuming ground
                        alert only). The extra 1962 appropriation would cover only the initial
                        procurement of the bombers themselves.</p>
                    <p>Many of the same considerations apply to the B-70. It was conceived and
                        designed in a period in which we had no <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> or Polaris. Its design, in effect, duplicates rather than
                        complements the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. It is
                        predicated on the assumption that high speed is the best way to penetrate
                        enemy defenses. This speed has made the system very expensive and quite
                        ineffective for the special tasks for which bombers are well suited.
                        Ironically, it now appears that prior defense suppression with missiles
                        (e.g., B-52 with Skybolt) is a much more effective way than speed to assure
                        penetration. The B-70 weapon system as presently designed would not really
                        have a capability to search for targets of unknown or <pb n="180"
                            xml:id="pg_180" facs="0212"/>uncertain location, or to seek out and
                        attack mobile targets. The Air Force is examining the use of the B-70 in a
                        strike-reconnaissance role. However, even if it can be modified for this
                        purpose, the changes in subsystems and doctrine would be so extensive that
                        it does not appear reasonable to commit it to production at this time.
                        Moreover, the problem of adequate pre-launch survival potential for bombers
                        in the wartime environment has not been solved.</p>
                    <p>The B-70 funding request to the Congress totaled $220.0 million. This is the
                        required 1962 budget amendments. I know of no justification for obligating
                        an additional $85.8 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962. There
                        is no known military requirement for Dynosoar. There is at most merely a
                        possibility that something of this character may be required at some time in
                        the future. Under the circumstances, it seems to me to be best to
                        concentrate on reducing lead time against the day when such a system might
                        be required. The best way to do this is to reorient the project to solve the
                        difficult technical <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 increment of a
                        $1.3 billion program extending through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1965 to provide and test three prototype aircraft, one of which will be
                        equipped with a Bomb Navigation System. Under this program, flight tests of
                        the first aircraft will begin in December 1962, with the other two aircraft
                        to follow at nine month intervals. The program permits the continuation of
                        essential technological development and retains the option to proceed with
                        the development of a complete weapon system at a later date, should it be
                        determined to be necessary. In view of the uncertainty about the need for
                        additional long-range bombers and the suitability of the B-70, I believe
                        that the scope of the B-70 program as contained in the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 budget request adequately meets our
                        defense needs. To spend the extra money in 1962 would be to restore the B-70
                        to the Air Force proposed full scale weapon system development program. The
                        extra cost of the Air Force program over the cost of the program I am
                        recommending would be not only the $180 million <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1962, but also $3 to $5 billion over the period
                        1963-1967.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Dynosoar, we added $30 million to expedite development in the
                        first set of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> problems involved in boosting
                        a body of high lift into orbit, sustaining man in it, and recovering the
                        vehicle at a designated place, rather than to press on with a full system
                        development program. It has been so oriented in the past and has tended to
                        become a full system development program of unspecified objectives. I am
                        studying the reorientation now, and when this study is completed, I shall be
                        able to estimate appropriate funding requirements. Until then, I believe
                        that we should hold the extra $85.8 million. Indeed, it is not clear now
                        that more money for Dynosoar would result in any advancement of the date of
                        first successful manned flight.</p>

                        <p>We fully support the proposition that the U.S. should seek improvements
                            in its strategic force which would increase its survivability, its
                            flexibility, and its ability to be used in a controlled and deliberate
                            way under a wide range of contingencies. This has been assured by the
                            planned Defense program. If there is any imbalance, it would appear to
                            be weighted on the side of strategic needs as compared with likely
                            requirements for conventional forces arising out of potential foreign
                            policy developments during the period covered by the budget.</p>
                        <p>If a reallocation of resources between these alternative needs seems
                            militarily inadvisable consideration should be given to some increase in
                            the total planned Defense budget.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Command and Control</hi>. It is strongly in our
                            foreign policy interest that the plans and capabilities of our strategic
                            forces be sufficiently flexible so that they could be used with
                            discrimination in any one of a number of alternative ways, as
                            circumstances may dictate. To this end, it is of vital importance that
                            our command and control arrangements be sufficiently effective and well
                            protected to permit continuous civilian control over the use of these
                            forces during grave crises and during actual hostilities.</p>
                        <p>It is also desirable that use of tactical nuclear forces be subject to
                            centralized effective control, both because limited use of these forces
                            may be a significant form of political bargaining and pressure short of
                            general war and because any such use would clearly involve a very high
                            risk of general war. We will want to ensure that use of these weapons is
                            not initiated without a political decision and that any such use is
                            subject to constant and specific political control if it is begun.</p>
                        <p>We are especially interested, from this standpoint, in ensuring effective
                            control of such front-line weapons as the Davy Crockett which we
                            understand are to be deployed to Europe. Our concern is the greater
                            since we doubt it will be possible to deploy these weapons to U.S.
                            forces there, without also generating European demands for these weapons
                            which it would be difficult to resist. (We have never been able to
                            resist such pressures in the past.) We would suggest that you appraise
                            the military significance of delaying deployment of these weapons to
                            Europe until the institution of effective arrangements for their
                            control, e.g., by means of the “permissive link,” to ensure that these
                            weapons will not be used without proper authorization by U.S. or allied
                            front-line units.</p>

                            achieve an effective operational system by that time, it would afford
                            them an opportunity for exerting immense pressures on the Western
                            Alliance. The initial psychological impact on allies and even

                                    Defense has decided on a limited program of Nike-Zeus production
                                    which will provide 12 batteries of such weapons, enough to
                                    defend six or seven cities, by 1967. A program of such limited
                                    size seems largely to result from serious reservations
                                    concerning the weapon's effectiveness. Despite these
                                    reservations the program is justified at least in part on the
                                    grounds that “the existence of a deployed defense may
                                    substantially increase the uncertainty at the Soviet decision
                                    making level.”</p>
                                <p>We seriously doubt that so limited a program, coming into
                                    operation as much as four years after the Soviets may have their
                                    own much more ambitious program operational, satisfactorily
                                    meets our objective. Either a substantial increase in this
                                    program should be decided upon or other alternatives explored. A
                                    much larger program, such as the 70 battery program recommended
                                    by <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss>, might considerably
                                    enhance the possibility of sowing uncertainty in the Soviet
                                    mind. Whether so ambitious a program is warranted given the
                                    added expense, largely revolves around the question of the
                                    weapon's effectiveness. The judgment as to the effectiveness of
                                    the weapon system is of course one for the Department of Defense
                                    to make. However, if the weapon is deemed not militarily
                                    effective we would seriously question the advisability of

                                    effect of creating uncertainty at the Soviet decision making
                                    level. In fact I fear, quite to the contrary, the limited,
                                    time-lagging effort cannot help but be viewed as a clear
                                    indication of U.S. impotence in this field.</p>
                                <p>As to whether other avenues are open to us to offset this serious
                                    potential Soviet advantage, we take it that all current
                                    alternative missile systems are being fully explored with no
                                    current prospect of a more reliable system in sight. We would
                                    hope that no reasonable effort in this field is being restricted
                                    by virtue of budgetary unavailability.</p></item>

                                Soviet anti-missile successes. The Defense budget recognizes that an

                        <p>3. Need for building an adequate level of military forces to deter
                            non-strategic attack. U.S. preparedness efforts of prior years appear to
                            have been inadequate in deterring limited and ambiguous Communist
                            pressures. The prospects for the future suggest a continuance and even
                            intensification of these limited pressures. From a foreign policy
                            standpoint, therefore, it is desirable to remedy the past imbalance in
                            our defense preparedness: to increase the level of resources going to
                            deter Bloc non-strategic attack, while maintaining the present
                            sufficiency of our strategic forces. We need readily available military
                            force which can not only cope with actual hostilities but also serve as
                            a clear and positive deterrent to limited aggression. In this
                            connection, the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> budget raises
                            certain serious questions.</p>

                                    target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> budget actually projects a cutback
                                in force levels, principally in the Army, below those currently
                                approved. This is presumably based on the assumption that the Berlin
                                crisis will have eased thereby permitting such a cutback. While not
                                unmindful of the qualitative and even to some extent quantitative
                                improvements which will result from the current buildup and which
                                are maintained in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '63 <gloss
                                    target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> budget, we would argue that the
                                surest method for preventing further Berlin crises, if indeed our
                                current effort is successful, is to maintain no less than the
                                present level. As we noted in our letter to the Secretary of Defense
                                of June 27, 1961,<note n="6" xml:id="d53fn6">Reference is to <ref

                                    27.</note> the Communists have entered on a period of
                                over-confidence. We must disabuse them, if there is not to be a risk
                                of serious miscalculation on their part. An increase in the levels
                                of our non-strategic forces would surely impress the Soviet
                                government, particularly given its traditional preoccupation with
                                    <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0224"/>ground strength. This
                                would be due not only to the actual increase in U.S. military
                                capability which would result but equally because it would create
                                doubts as to the validity of Communist dogma concerning the
                                unwillingness of democracies to shoulder long-term burdens and to
                                accept risks as Communist states are prepared to do. Finally, and
                                equally important, the higher the level of U.S. force capability
                                which the crises leaves the Soviets to cope with, the more likely
                                the Soviets are to be impressed with the disadvantages of stirring

                                reliance upon call up of reservists in the event of emergency is
                                inevitable. However, it is entirely likely that the Soviets,
                                appreciating the difficulties inherent in the democratic process of
                                raising forces and marshalling public opinion to meet emergencies,
                                will periodically create crises which will present the U.S.
                                government with increasing political difficulties in attempting to
                                effect large-scale reserve call-ups. From a foreign policy
                                standpoint, we must count on a continuing series of such pressures.
                                It, therefore, seems important to plan for a higher level of
                                available general purpose forces. It is strongly urged that
                                consideration be given to this course of action, which would have
                                important implications for our tactical air—as well as
                                ground—forces.</item>

                                some time over the need to develop a U.S. capability (i) to give
                                advice and training and assistance to indigenous elements and (ii)
                                to conduct guerrilla operations. Progress in this area has suffered
                                in the past from inadequate funds as well as from a reluctance to
                                accord a sufficient priority to such unconventional type of military
                                activity. We are therefore delighted to see that the Department of
                                Defense has included a special allocation of $100 million for such
                                operations in the 63 budget. This is a move in the right direction
                                but it leaves open the question of whether this amount, primarily to
                                be devoted to research, is sufficient to meet the need. Our current
                                experience in Southeast Asia demonstrates, at least in part, our
                                inability to cope effectively with the type of ambiguous guerrilla
                                military threat presented. We must expect an increase in such
                                Communist activity, not only there but elsewhere—Latin America, the
                                Middle East and Africa—and the need to combat these efforts rapidly
                                and effectively should be given a high priority. We suggest that the
                                Department of Defense reassess this item in light of the above with
                                a view to substantially increasing the priority and funds accorded
                                to it.</item>

                            increasing opportunities for the Soviets to exert military pressure
                            along the extensive periphery of free-world borders have created the

                        <p>The questions we have are three-fold. First, in terms of the magnitude of
                            force which could quickly be brought to bear by the enemy in remote
                            areas, e.g., Southeast Asia, Korea and Iran, are we making sufficient
                            provision to provide us with an alternative to the immediate employment
                            of nuclear weapons (or acceptance of defeat)? Second, as we mentioned in
                            our letter to the Secretary of Defense of June 27, 1961, assuming that
                            the Communists choose to exert pressure in two places simultaneously,
                            e.g., Iran and Southeast Asia, do our plans provide sufficient
                            conventional force to meet such a contingency? Third, will it be
                            possible to commit forces to distant, underdeveloped areas even in the
                            magnitude contemplated by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> almost
                            solely through airlift? For example, will not the paucity of adequate
                            airfields in the less-developed areas of the world limit our ability to
                            respond effectively?</p>
                        <p>All these questions raise questions about the adequacy of projected
                            sealift. For example, we note that Defense plans to build only one of
                            the newly developed, and we gather highly efficient, roll-on/roll-off
                            ships a year. In light of the importance of having an effective and
                            flexible force available for deployment to remote areas, we suggest that
                            the Department of Defense reexamine its lift plan to assure that within
                            the limits of production feasibility they provide adequately for our
                            needs.</p>

                            a multilaterally owned and controlled sea-borne <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> missile force, such as the President discussed in his
                            Ottawa speech.</p>
                        <p>It is in the U.S. interest to hold to this policy. Deployment of <gloss
                                target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>'s to the forces of individual
                            countries would be a major step toward creation of de facto national
                            strategic nuclear capabilities. This would create peacetime tensions and
                            divisions within the alliance, as well as greatly lessen our ability to
                            follow a non-nuclear strategy or a centrally controlled nuclear strategy
                            in event of hostilities. On the other hand, deployment of <gloss
                                target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>'s to U.S. forces only would probably
                            be politically infeasible. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            policy of initial deployment to U.S. forces while holding out the
                            possibility of a multilateral force thus seems the most useful
                            course.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult, however, to conceive of carrying out this policy with
                            land-based <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> deployment.
                            Multilateral deployment would be clearly less feasible on land than at
                            sea, since missiles would be vulnerable to seizure by the countries on
                            whose territory they were to be deployed. And, as for deployment to U.S.
                            forces only, the European countries on whose soil the U.S. <gloss
                                target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>'s were to be deployed would insist on
                            securing some of these missiles for their own forces as a pre-condition
                            to giving us deployment rights.</p>
                        <p>These considerations suggest that sea-based deployment is greatly
                            preferable from a foreign policy standpoint. At a minimum, they make it
                            desirable to avoid allowing the question of land-based vs. sea-based
                            deployment to be foreclosed by the nature of development work which is
                            planned within the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>

                                This study concluded that controlled response strategy could not be

                                requirements for a controlled response strategy were exaggerated in
                                the Hickey study, and its feasibility underestimated. “I see no

                                response strategy by 1964 if not sooner. I reject the suggestion
                                implicit in the Hickey Study that all of these advanced capabilities

                            point of difference in arriving at the two force levels is that while
                            your analysis estimates that the situation at the outset of war would be
                            characterized by intelligence and operational factors between the
                            optimistic and the median cases, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider the
                            median case more likely. To illustrate the degree of increased assurance
                            attained by the higher level of forces, application to them of the
                            median factors for 1965 produces additional alert weapons on target on

                        <item>The subject of long-range nuclear delivery force objectives is one
                            which must be kept under constant scrutiny with a view to refining the
                            factors involved in determining optimum force levels. The analysis

                    <p>In a memorandum for the record dated November 20, 1961, Colonel

                        meeting that day. The memorandum reads in part:</p>
                    <p>“A procedural discussion was conducted on country and regional guideline
                        papers. The policy and planning shop in State is preparing these papers,
                        which are approved in principle by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                            >Bowles</persName>, circulated to the other Departments for comment, and
                        then approved for final policy by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                            >Bowles</persName> or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.
                        State then requests <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to rescind the old
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy paper on the area. The State
                        guideline paper then becomes the substitute for an <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>-type paper on the area involved. Rostow observed that he
                        had told the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff not to bother with
                        these papers, that they can't afford to waste time on them. Bundy agreed,
                        saying that the actual policy was determined by adding up actions that the
                        President had approved on the country concerned or by asking the White House
                        staff how the President felt about a particular country. Bromley and I
                        pointed out that the low level staff officer was not always aware of the
                        decisions or White House thinking, and tended to rely on the guideline paper
                        regardless of whether it was good or not. Bundy recognized this aspect and
                        directed that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff would do a quick
                        check on such papers before they were finally approved, for substance, not
                        for style.” (National Defense University, Taylor Papers, Daily Staff
                        Meetings 9-12/61) “Bromley” refers to Bromley Smith, Executive Secretary of
                        the National Security Council.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Basic Principles</hi></p>
                    <p>1. Soviet thinking about military policy has proceeded from a general outlook
                        which stresses that historical forces are moving inexorably in the direction
                        of communism. This movement is carried forward by the struggle of “the
                        masses,” led by the Communist parties, to overthrow the existing
                        social-economic order, rather than by the direct use of the military power
                        of the Communist Bloc. These beliefs lead the Soviets to view their armed
                        forces as a means to deter Western military action against the Sino-Soviet
                        Bloc, to inhibit the West from intervening militarily in other areas, to
                        maintain security within the Bloc, to lend weight to their political demands
                        and to demonstrate the success and growing power of their cause. At the same
                        time, they wish to have the forces to fight a war effectively should one
                        occur. However, their political outlook, their military <pb n="199"
                            xml:id="pg_199" facs="0231"/>programs of recent years, and intelligence
                        on their current intentions, all suggest that the Soviet leaders do not
                        regard general war as desirable or a Western attack on them as probable.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Strategies and Forces</hi></p>
                    <p>2. Within this general framework, the specific concepts which underlie Soviet
                        decisions about force goals and strategic planning are difficult to discern.
                        These principles can only be deduced, and incompletely at that, from overt
                        Soviet statements, which are carefully framed with an eye to both security
                        and propaganda; from such classified Soviet information as can be obtained;
                        from the choices reflected in the actual military programs undertaken by the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; and from the strategic situation
                        which objectively confronts them.</p>
                    <p>3. It is worth noting that, while the Soviets have made impressive advances
                        in modern weapon systems, a number of factors have hampered the process of
                        integrating these advances into their strategic doctrine. One of these
                        factors is the influence of a long military tradition, strongly reinforced
                        by their experience in World War II, stressing massive movement, protracted
                        campaigns, and the paramount significance of ground combat and the
                        occupation of enemy territory. Another is security barriers within the
                        military establishment, which appear to be far more stringent than in the
                        US. Perhaps the most serious fetter, however, has been the rigid
                        politico-military concepts which Stalin dogmatically imposed upon military
                        thought. It was not until the mid-1950's, for example, that Soviet doctrine
                        began to relax the principle that strategic surprise and the force of the
                        initial blow are relatively unimportant to the outcome of a war between
                        major powers, a position Stalin took in order to divert attention from the
                        USSR's nearly catastrophic unpreparedness at the outset of World War II.</p>
                    <p>4. The pace of military thought, however, has quickened sharply in the last
                        two or three years, primarily at the initiative of <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. At about the time when he set
                        in motion a modernization of the Soviet force structure, including a
                        substantial reduction in personnel, the regime began deliberately to
                        encourage controversial discussion among senior officers in an effort to
                        spark original and creative thought. As a result, strategic doctrine is a
                        lively and argumentative field of professional study in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> today.</p>
                    <p>5. Such high-level discourse as we know about does not revolve around the
                        questions of alternative attack strategies and target systems which are at
                        the center of US military attention. Instead, the chief argument ranges
                        “conservative” against “modern” views. Adherents to the first view assert
                        that, despite the advent of new weapons, general war is likely to be
                        protracted, ground combat on a mass scale will continue to be of major
                        importance, and victory will require the combined action of forces of all
                        types, including a multimillion man army. Adherents to the <pb n="200"
                            xml:id="pg_200" facs="0232"/>second view charge that their opponents are
                        making only minimal and inadequate adaptations of earlier doctrine to
                        accommodate new weapons. This group argues that a general war is likely to
                        be short, with victory decided primarily in the initial nuclear exchange.
                        Current official doctrine, as it appears in statements by the Minister of
                        Defense, appears to be an amalgam of both these views.</p>
                    <p>6. The high-level discussions of which we are aware are remarkably deficient
                        in sophisticated analysis of such concepts as first and second strike
                        capability or counterforce strategy. The problems of attacking hardened and
                        mobile strategic forces go completely unmentioned in such information as we
                        have on Soviet targeting for long range attack. While most recommended
                        target lists include nuclear retaliatory forces and control centers, they
                        generally give equal importance to strikes against urban centers and their
                        enemy's broad warmaking potential.</p>
                    <p>7. We think it certain that the strategic thought which underlies operational
                        planning in the long range striking forces themselves is more sophisticated
                        than this. But we have not acquired detailed Soviet discussions of doctrine
                        for the operations of long range missile and bomber forces. Planning in
                        these forces has certainly been obliged to consider such factors as warning
                        and reaction times and the specific characteristics of different weapon
                        systems and enemy targets. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] indicates that at least some of these factors have
                        been taken into account, but not in ways that suggest very advanced concepts
                        for dealing with the problems involved.</p>
                    <p>8. On the whole, the information we have suggests that Soviet military
                        thought generally is still preoccupied with the problems of integrating
                        nuclear and missile weapons into general doctrine and is only beginning to
                        cope with the detailed comparative analysis of alternative strategies and
                        force levels. Nor is this preoccupation completely surprising, since the
                        achievement of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability, even in
                        the early stages of its deployment, represents to the Soviets a profound
                        change in their strategic situation. For over a decade, they confronted an
                        opponent who possessed a formidable strategic capability but against whom
                        their own long-range striking capabilities were relatively limited. Now, for
                        the first time, they have a weapon system capable of delivering nuclear
                        attacks against the US with little warning by a means against which there is
                        no present defense.</p>
                    <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably has not elaborated any
                        comprehensive doctrine covering the contingencies of limited and local war
                        between Soviet and Western forces. Public Soviet statements regularly insist
                        that such wars would quickly and inevitably expand into general nuclear war.
                        These statements are clearly intended to deter the West from embarking upon
                        conflict on the Bloc periphery or attempting penetrations of Bloc territory;
                        they are not necessarily to be taken as expressions of Soviet military <pb

                        reveal what detailed contingency plans the Soviets have for such a case. We
                        believe, however, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would wish
                        to avoid direct involvement in limited combat on the Bloc periphery and, if
                        such conflict should occur, would wish to minimize the chances of escalation
                        to general nuclear war. Consequently, it would not in most circumstances
                        take the initiative to expand the scope of such a conflict. Although the
                        degree of Soviet commitment and the actual circumstances of the conflict
                        would determine their decision, we believe that in general the Soviet
                        leaders would expand the scope of the conflict, even at greater risk of
                        escalating to general war, only if a prospective defeat would, in their
                        view, constitute a grave political reverse within the Bloc itself or a major
                        setback to the Soviet world position.</p>
                    <p>10. Soviet doctrine apparently does not contemplate conflict with Western
                        forces in areas of contention at a distance from Bloc territory. Conflicts
                        involving local anti-Western or Communist forces are treated under the
                        rubric of “national liberation wars.” Such forces are credited, on
                        ideological grounds, with the inherent strength to overcome “imperialist”
                        attempts at military intervention. The Soviet support rather vaguely
                        proffered is intended to be of a general deterrent character, but does not
                        envisage overt Soviet military involvement. Despite the Soviet tendency in
                        recent years to adopt an aggressive political stance in conflicts all over
                        the world, the Soviets have not developed the naval forces and other special
                        components which would give them a capability for military operations at
                        great distances from the Bloc.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Current Strategic Posture</hi></p>
                    <p>11. The strategic nuclear force the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                        developed in recent years could permit the launching of large-scale initial
                        attacks on short notice against a large number of Eurasian targets and a
                        more limited number of North American targets. However, the Soviet leaders
                        cannot at present have any assurance that their own nation and system could
                        escape destruction from retaliatory Western attacks even if the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> struck first. The Soviet leaders
                        evidently believe their current strategic forces provide a strong deterrent
                        against Western initiation of general war and are sufficient to support a
                        more assertive foreign policy, particularly by virtue of the threat they
                        pose to allies of the US in Europe and Asia. But there is no implication in
                        Soviet behavior that they consider themselves in a position deliberately to
                        attack the West, or to undertake local moves which carried with them a
                        serious risk of bringing on general war. These views do not exclude Soviet
                        use of available strategic attack forces to launch a preemptive blow should
                        they conclude that the West was irrevocably committed to an imminent
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>12. There have been considerable improvements in the Soviet air defense
                        establishment, primarily through the widespread deployment of surface-to-air
                        missiles at major cities and other key installations. <pb n="202"
                            xml:id="pg_202" facs="0234"/>Soviet defenses are now reasonably adequate
                        against medium and high-altitude attack by subsonic Western bombers. We
                        believe that the system as a whole, however, is far less adequate to cope
                        with sophisticated penetration tactics, low altitude penetrations or
                        supersonic cruise-type missiles. It has no present capability against
                        ballistic missiles. Most important, because of the susceptibility of their
                        defenses to saturation and degradation, the Soviet leaders almost certainly
                        cannot be confident of the degree to which they could cope with the diverse
                        types and scales of attack the West could direct against the Bloc.</p>
                    <p>13. In addition to forces designed for long-range attack and for defense
                        against such attack, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> continues to
                        maintain large theater field forces. The Soviets regard these forces as part
                        of the deterrent to general war, and their military doctrine considers such
                        forces as essential to the conduct of general war should it occur. The
                        Soviet theater forces now in being could institute large-scale attacks in
                        peripheral areas, but the success of such operations in a general war would
                        depend heavily on the outcome of the initial nuclear exchange. The Soviet
                        leaders also regard these forces as a deterrent to any limited action
                        against Bloc territory or on its periphery, serving at the same time as an
                        essential means of maintaining Communist regimes in the Satellites.</p>
                    <p>14. Based on the current Soviet naval posture and available writings on
                        doctrine, we believe that the mission of the Soviet Navy is to carry out a
                        variety of tasks in a protracted war, including the support of theater
                        forces in such a war. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                        developed some capability to deliver nuclear attacks against land targets,
                        including some in the US, by means of short-range submarine-launched
                        missiles. However, the bulk of the Soviet submarine forces, predominantly
                        torpedo attack types, would engage in interdiction operations in a long war
                        in which the US attempted to maintain extensive logistic support to overseas
                        areas. The Soviet Navy would also conduct defense against hostile naval
                        forces possessing long-range attack capabilities, which the Soviets
                        evidently regard as a major strategic threat. Its capabilities against US
                        missile submarines in the open seas remain severely limited.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military Research and Development</hi></p>
                    <p>15. The Soviets are engaged in intensive efforts in weapons research and
                        development to acquire new systems which, by their psychological, political,
                        and military impact, would shift the world relation of forces to their
                        advantage. In making their decisions, Soviet planners will have to consider
                        such problems as rapid technological change, long lead times, developments
                        in opposing forces, and increasing costs of weapon systems. Despite the
                        rapid growth in Soviet economic resources, there will continue to be
                        competition among military requirements as well as with the demands of
                        important nonmilitary programs. Over the last two years, for example,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> has apparently linked
                        his military arguments <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0235"/>for reducing
                        the size of Soviet forces with a further argument that additional funds
                        could in this way be made available for raising living standards.
                        Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is allocating funds
                        generously to military R&amp;D, concentrating major efforts on improving the
                        forces for long range attack and for defense against such attack by the
                        West.</p>
                    <p>16. Much of the military R&amp;D about which we have recent evidence is
                        designed to fill obvious gaps in the Soviet strategic posture. In the field
                        of long range delivery systems, an intensive program of test firing has been
                        underway to develop second generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        systems, which we believe include missiles of reduced dimensions and lighter
                        weight, more easily deployed than the massive first generation Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Some of the recent <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> testing may represent development of
                        systems for delivering warheads with yields on the order of 100 <gloss
                            target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss>. Both a 2,000 n.m. ballistic missile and a
                        supersonic “dash” medium bomber have been developed, and there is some
                        evidence of R&amp;D efforts in follow-on heavy bombers.</p>
                    <p>17. The principal current Soviet R&amp;D program for strategic air defense,
                        and perhaps the major Soviet military developmental program, is a
                        large-scale effort to achieve defenses against ballistic missiles. It has
                        been clear to us for more than a year that the Soviets are assigning very
                        substantial resources to this effort. In October 1961, Marshal Malinovsky
                        stated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had “solved the
                        problem” of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight. From intelligence
                        sources, we believe that the Soviets are making good progress in development
                        work for an antimissile system. This effort has resulted in the acquisition
                        of important data, including data on high altitude nuclear effects, and has
                        also involved the testing of at least some system components. Other known
                        R&amp;D in the air defense field over the recent past has included improved
                        radars for early warning and fighter control, a surface-to-air missile
                        system for use against low-altitude penetrators, and new fighter interceptor
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>18. Soviet research and development activities also reflect efforts at
                        qualitative improvement in the theater field forces and naval forces. The
                        emphasis has been on mobility and fire-power for theater forces, and short
                        and medium-range missiles are now available for their support. Soviet field
                        forces, at least in East Germany, have been allocated surface-to-air
                        missiles for defense against medium and high altitude air attack. Within the
                        next two or three years they will probably also have available missiles for
                        defense against low flying aircraft as well as against ballistic missiles of
                        short ranges. With the advent of US missile submarines, the Soviet Navy has
                        recently placed increased emphasis on new weapons and techniques to extend
                            <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capabilities to the open seas. We
                        believe, however, that over the next five years, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have only a limited capability to
                        detect, identify, localize and maintain surveillance on submarines operating
                        in the open seas.</p>

                    <p>19. The preliminary information now available indicates that the 1961 nuclear
                        test series has given the Soviets increased confidence in current weapon
                        systems, advanced their weapon design significantly, added greatly to their
                        understanding of thermonuclear weapon technology, and contributed vital
                        weapon effects knowledge. Soviet thermonuclear weapon technology in
                        particular appears to be sophisticated and advanced. The 1961 test series
                        will permit the Soviets to fabricate and stock pile, during the next year or
                        so, new weapons of higher yields in the weight classes presently
                        available.</p>
                    <p>20. Of the 44 shots detected in the 1961 series, 5 to 10 appear to have been
                        proof tests of complete weapon systems, many of them with yields in the
                        megaton range. We believe the Soviets have proof-tested weapon systems of
                        the following types: short or medium range ground-launched ballistic
                        missiles with yields up to about 2 <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> and
                        short-range submarine-launched ballistic missiles with yields of about 3
                            <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss>. In addition, they have proof-tested
                        bombs with yields up to about 6 <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> and have
                        probably delivered more than one such bomb on a single bomber mission. The
                        warheads tested in these various weapon systems are believed to be in
                        stockpile. Those few proof-tested warheads thus far analyzed appear to
                        reflect 1958 technology.</p>
                    <p>21. Weapon effects test were apparently conducted underground, underwater,
                        near the surface of the water, and at various altitudes up to 100-200 n.m.
                        Those at very high altitudes will contribute valuable effects information
                        needed for Soviet development of antiballistic missile defenses, but were
                        probably not complete systems tests.</p>
                    <p>22. The majority of the 1961 shots were developmental tests aimed at
                        improving future Soviet nuclear weapons capabilities. Some of the fission
                        weapons tested revealed extensive Soviet efforts to increase efficiency, and
                        to reduce weapon size and weight. Two very large yield tests in this series
                        are particularly significant in that they indicate a high degree of
                        sophistication in weapon design.</p>

                        of the shots in the recent series, indicate a continuing and highly
                        successful Soviet effort to improve efficiencies, improve yield-to-weight
                        ratios, and reduce fissionable material requirements. These tests show a
                        concentration on weapons with yields between about 1.5 and 5 <gloss
                            target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> (corresponding to weights between about 1,000
                        and 3,500 pounds), which are suitable for delivery by all Soviet bombers and
                        offensive missiles. The preliminary analysis indicates that, [<hi
                            rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] significant
                        progress in thermonuclear weapons design has been achieved.</p>
                    <p>Probable Major Developments in Soviet Forces to the Mid-1960's</p>
                    <p>24. Major Soviet concern will continue to focus on the strategic weapons
                        balance. In this area, a critical question is whether or not the Soviet
                        leaders will consider it feasible and desirable to: (a) seek a capability to
                        destroy the US nuclear delivery forces prior to launching, by means of a
                        first strike; (b) seek no more than a capability to deliver nuclear attacks
                        on population and industrial centers; or (c) seek nuclear attack forces of a
                        type and size which will be somewhere between these two concepts.</p>
                    <p>25. We believe the Soviets already view the first of these concepts as no
                        longer practicable. This is partly because of the thousands of Soviet
                        missiles and launchers that would be required to destroy all the fixed bases
                        of the US nuclear force programmed for 1963-1967, especially the hardened US
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites. Equally important, US
                        warning capabilities, fast reaction times, and mobile forces such as
                        airborne bombers and missile submarines already tend to offset Soviet
                        capabilities to attack fixed bases. These latter factors would compound the
                        uncertainties inherent in any Soviet strategy for destroying US nuclear
                        forces prior to launch, regardless of the size of Soviet long-range striking
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>26. As to a capability to attack cities alone, there is evidence from recent
                        statements and writings that some Soviet military men regard destruction of
                        population and industry, not merely as something to be threatened for
                        purposes of deterrence and intimidation, but also as a major determinant in
                        the outcome of a general war. In view of the weight of nuclear attack the US
                        can launch and the impossibility of achieving a fully effective defense,
                        however, we believe that the Soviet leaders have <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206"
                            facs="0238"/>decided that a capability to destroy only urban and
                        industrial centers, while a powerful deterrent, would be inadequate should
                        general war occur.</p>
                    <p>27. Consequently, we believe that the Soviets will seek a large strike
                        capability. This will probably be one large enough to bring under attack the
                            <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bomber bases and other soft and
                        semihardened US military installations against which their <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s are an efficient weapon system. Further,
                        in determining force goals, they may also wish to provide themselves with an
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force large enough to permit them
                        to attack some hardened US targets, and to have a more substantial residual
                        striking capability after a US attack. Although the Soviets would probably
                        not regard a capability on this order as adequate for deliberate initiation
                        of general war, it would put them in a position to strike pre-emptively at
                        an important segment of the US nuclear delivery forces should they reach a
                        decision that such action was required.</p>
                    <p>28. Taking these considerations into account, we believe that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> force of several hundred operational launchers in the
                        period 1964-1967. The deployment complexes presently in operation and under
                        construction, while protected by concealment from ground observation, some
                        dispersal, and surface-to-air missiles, are unhardened and vulnerable to
                        overhead observation. In view of Soviet concern for US reconnaissance and
                        attack capabilities, we believe that the Soviets will move to increase the
                        survivability of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. In the
                        mid-1960's, the bulk of the force will probably be protected by greater
                        dispersal and possibly by semihardening, and some of the later launchers
                        will probably be fully hardened. More than one missile will probably be
                        available for most launchers.</p>
                    <p>29. In addition, through 1967, we forecast that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> will retain a mix of long range weapon systems. This will
                        include a heavy bomber force which will probably remain relatively small but
                        increase in quality, and an expanding force of missile submarines. Medium
                        bomber strength will probably drop to a few hundred by the mid-1960's, but a
                        considerable portion of these will be supersonic “dash” types, perhaps
                        equipped for standoff missile delivery and for armed reconnaissance. After
                        about the next year, ballistic missile forces other than <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s will be characterized by shifts to
                        improved, longer range systems rather than by sheer numerical expansion.</p>
                    <p>30. In addition to strengthening defenses against manned bombers and
                        cruise-type missiles, we believe that a major Soviet objective of the
                        mid-1960's will be to achieve defenses against long-range ballistic missiles
                        before the US has acquired a comparable capability. In Soviet eyes, this
                        would enable them to claim an important advantage over the US. For political
                        as well as military reasons, the Soviets probably would wish to deploy
                        antimissile defense in at least a few critical areas even if the available
                            <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0239"/>system provided only a limited,
                        interim capability. Considering these factors and the present status of the
                        Soviet research and development program, we estimate that in the period
                        1963-1966 the Soviets will begin at least limited deployment of an
                        antimissile system. Soviet cities will probably have priority for deployment
                        of any AICBM defenses available through 1967. We believe that throughout
                        this period, the Soviets are likely to have only a marginal capability for
                        interference with US satellites.</p>
                    <p>31. We believe that the Soviet leaders will continue to retain large theater
                        and naval forces. The extent to which these forces are reduced in the next
                        few years will depend in part on the prevailing international situation, but
                        we now believe it may rest equally on the course of the internal Soviet
                        discussion regarding the nature and duration of a large-scale war fought
                        with nuclear weapons. In general, we believe that economic and political
                        factors, together with the further growth of nuclear capabilities, will at
                        some point persuade the Soviet leaders to revert to the military manpower
                        reductions begun in 1960 but suspended in 1961. Ground divisions and
                        tactical air forces will probably be reduced and older ships retired or
                        mothballed, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will retain
                        sizable forces calculated to be sufficient for all types of warfare, nuclear
                        and conventional, limited and general. Moreover, the Soviets will not
                        abandon the reservist and mobilization system designed to augment their
                        forces rapidly should the need arise.</p>
                    <p>32. The recent nuclear test series does not in itself provide clear
                        guidelines as to possible changes in force structure or strategic concepts.
                        We believe that long-range striking forces have been given priority in the
                        allocation of available nuclear materials, and that limitations in the
                        Soviet stockpile have consequently restricted the nuclear capabilities of
                        other forces. The broad range of proof tests, weapon effects tests, and
                        developmental tests in the 1961 series suggests an effort to improve the
                        nuclear capabilities of all arms of the Soviet military establishment. We
                        had anticipated that in any event the limitations on allocation of nuclear
                        weapons to air defense, theater, and naval forces would have eased by the
                        mid-1960's and this trend may be hastened by the recent tests. These forces
                        will then have a greater variety of nuclear weapons at their disposal.</p>
                    <p>33. It now appears that the trend in nuclear weapon yields of long-range
                        missile and bomber systems will be upwards. The use of higher yield weapons
                        would tend to reduce Soviet numerical requirements for delivery vehicles to
                        accomplish given objectives, although for attacking military targets the
                        accuracy and reliability of the Soviet weapon systems are generally more
                        critical than warhead yield. Warheads in the 25 <gloss target="#t_MT1"
                            >MT</gloss> class, which could probably be made available in quantity
                        within a year or so, would enhance the capabilities of the first generation
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0240"/>against hardened targets. It is
                        reasonable to believe that some of the new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s now under intensive testing are designed to carry
                        warheads of very high yield. Nevertheless, we continue to believe it
                        unlikely that the Soviets would try to acquire the very large number of
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers needed for effective
                        attack on all the hardened <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites
                        planned by the US. For the present, the very high yield devices are probably
                        intended to support deterrence and psychological warfare, although we have
                        no doubt that military uses are also intended.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Policy and Strategies to the
                            Mid-1960's</hi></p>
                    <p>34. From the developments likely to occur in Soviet forces, and from
                        implications found in current discussions of military doctrine, we conclude
                        that, over the next five years or so, the Soviets are unlikely to develop a
                        military strategy and posture aimed at the deliberate initiation of general
                        war. They are likely to continue to believe that their policy goals cannot
                        be achieved by this means. Therefore, their first priority, since they
                        evidently do intend to pursue forward policies involving some level of risk,
                        will be to have a credible deterrent against initiation of war by the West.
                        They will recognize that deterrence may fail, and if completely convinced in
                        some situation of high risk that the West was about to launch a general
                        nuclear attack, would attempt to pre-empt. Their strategy for the conduct of
                        general war will probably call for delivering large-scale nuclear blows
                        against Western striking forces and national centers of power, protecting
                        the Soviet homeland against nuclear attack to the extent feasible, and
                        subsequently committing their remaining forces to extended campaigns
                        probably aimed initially at the occupation of Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>35. The Soviets will want a formidable military posture primarily to prevent
                        such a war, but they will also want it as a support to vigorous policy
                        initiatives short of war. These latter will include in particular the
                        sponsorship of revolutionary activity directed at advancing Communist or
                        pro-Soviet groups to power in any part of the world where the opportunity
                        exists or can be created. It is this sort of struggle below the level of
                        direct military engagement with the major Western Powers which will almost
                        certainly continue to be the Soviets' principal reliance in seeking the
                        expansion of their power.</p>
                    <p>36. It is conceivable, however, that by the mid-1960's the Soviets will come
                        to regard the deterrence which they can exert upon the West as strong enough
                        to permit them, without excessive risk, to use their own forces in local
                        military actions. They will certainly continue to have field forces on a
                        scale to permit this in areas peripheral to Soviet Bloc territory, and these
                        will be forces of increased mobility and flexibility. They are also capable
                        of acquiring the naval strength, air transport, and special forces to
                        conduct local military action in more remote areas. On the whole, however,
                        we believe that the Soviets are unlikely to adopt such a <pb n="209"
                            xml:id="pg_209" facs="0241"/>course as a matter of general policy, in
                        part because of the risks involved but also because in their view there is
                        likely to be increasing opportunity to advance their cause by nonmilitary
                        means.</p>
                    <p>37. The use of Soviet forces in local military actions outside the Bloc, if
                        attempted, would be unlikely to take the form of naked military aggression.
                        Instead, any use of Soviet forces outside the Bloc would take the form of
                        support to revolutionary actions by local Communist or pro-Soviet forces,
                        where a pretext could be made that Soviet intervention was intended to
                        forestall intervention by the “imperialists.” We believe there is some
                        possibility that such a strategy will emerge by the mid-1960's and will be
                        applied to vulnerable areas bordering on the Soviet Bloc. We think it more
                        likely, however, that the Soviets will continue to rely on local political
                        revolutionary forces, operating without overt Soviet military support but
                        under the protection of an increasing deterrent power, to achieve a more
                        gradual expansion of the area of Soviet control.</p>

                    <p>1. The major issue which was presented by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s memorandum on the Defense
                            budget<note n="1" xml:id="d57fn1"><ref target="#d50">Document
                            50</ref>.</note> is that of the balance between the long-range strategic
                        striking force and the general purpose (limited war) forces. Speaking
                        broadly, the Secretary's proposed Planning Guidelines resolved the
                        inevitable doubts and uncertainties on the high side with respect to
                        long-range striking forces, and, on the low side with respect to <pb n="210"
                            xml:id="pg_210" facs="0242"/>the general purpose forces. The purpose of
                        the following is to present a case for a different force structure which
                        would resolve these issues the other way.</p>
                    <p>2. The two elements of the strategic striking force which show rapid growth
                        in the Secretary's memorandum and proposed Guidelines are the hardened and
                        dispersed Minuteman and Polaris missiles. The B-52 force remains constant,
                        and, while the Atlas and Titan both show substantial growth, the new sites
                        involved are now under construction and the missiles have already been
                        bought. The proposed Minuteman and Polaris forces grow as follows:</p>

                    <p>The proposed Polaris force represents the submarines we have already bought,
                        coming into service on the present schedule. The proposed Minuteman
                        deployment involves postponing the achievement of the planned 4th wing from
                        the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 to the end of <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967.</p>
                    <p>The rationale for these lower forces is two-fold. First, as will be explained
                        in the paragraph immediately following, they can do the job. Second, if they
                        can do the job the risks of having higher forces are considerable. In
                        setting the level of our strategic force, we must always consider the
                        possibility of interaction between the size of our force and the size of the
                        Soviet force. It is dangerous for us to seek to achieve a full first strike
                        capability, because such a goal will almost certainly provoke a Soviet
                        reaction in the same direction. Both sides will spend more of their
                        resources on larger forces and neither will gain in security. The present
                        plan provides for an extremely sharp increase in our strategic striking
                        power between July 1963 and July 1964. Our total long-range missile
                        strength, which is now in the neighborhood of 120, will by July 1963 have
                        grown to over 500 and by July 1964 it will have more than doubled again to
                        over 1100. Will not such a sharp increase present the appearance of our <pb
                            n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0243"/>seeking a first strike posture, and
                        thus have a high probability of provoking a response in kind by the Soviets?
                        They are perfectly capable of such response. At present, the most sensible
                        interpretation of their own missile deployment is that it rests on the
                        concept of finite deterrence. It is certainly to our advantage to have them
                        continue to hold that concept. The Air Force has in the past equated
                        national security with an ever increasing strategic striking force, and this
                        position has wide popular appeal and support. This view is filled with
                        dangers; to the extent that the best evidence indicates it lacks
                        justification, it is important to move our military planning away from it as
                        soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>3. We can safely rely on the proposed smaller force for two reasons: First,
                        the number of missiles we expect the Russians to have is lower than that on
                        which the plans were made. On this basis alone, the task the Memorandum
                        shows as requiring 700 Minutemen in the force (Median assumptions, 1965,
                        column I), could be done by some 550. This involves not only a smaller
                        number of targets for us to strike at, but also a higher survival rate for
                        our forces under the Russian first strike, on the basis of which the
                        calculations are made. Second, the targeting concepts underlying the
                        calculations in the Secretary's memorandum are unnecessarily conservative.
                        No targets are assigned to the theatre forces. Only Polaris strikes against
                        cities are taken into account in estimating casualties and destruction in
                        built-up areas. At least the medium-range bomber and recovery airfields and
                        the medium-range ballistic missiles could be assigned to the theatre forces.
                        Some of the surviving <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> B-52's would be
                        available for strikes on cities. The missiles we program against Soviet
                        military targets would cause considerable casualties all over the Soviet
                        Union, which are not taken into account in the casualty estimates from
                        fallout presented in the memorandum. When all these adjustments are made in
                        the calculations, the proposed smaller forces become adequate for the
                        defined goal: to maintain a survivable second strike capability which can
                        both blunt the further Soviet threat and provide a reserve force capable of
                        threatening attack on Soviet cities on a large scale.</p>
                    <p>4. The Secretary's memorandum offers no explicit rationale for fixing the
                        size of the Army at 14 divisions comparable to the analysis contained in
                        Appendix I on long-range striking forces,<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2"><ref
                                target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note> and the Secretary pointed
                        out in our staff discussions that as yet no such analysis has been made.
                        Nonetheless, the recommendation is similar to that contained in the
                        Secretary's memorandum to the President of May 10, 1961,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d57fn3"><ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note> on the
                        reappraisal of the capabilities of conventional forces. That analysis rested
                        on two doubtful assumptions: First, that we would not be engaged in a
                        conventional war on a scale greater than that of the Korean <pb n="212"
                            xml:id="pg_212" facs="0244"/>conflict (250,000-300,000 men); second,
                        that we would not be engaged in more than one such war at any one time. If
                        in fact it is our policy to raise the nuclear threshold in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area, as well as in the rest of the
                        world, the first of these assumptions may be inappropriate. The
                        appropriateness of the second one is also open to question, although here a
                        policy question is involved as to the circumstances in which we would be
                        willing to commit U.S. troops in other theatres, that is as yet
                        unsettled.</p>
                    <p>5. The planned 14-division army raises the question of whether or not the
                        extra forces provided by calling up the reservists and National Guardsmen in
                        connection with the Berlin crisis should be retained on active duty. The
                        Secretary's proposal calls for the return of these men to reserve status and
                        a consequent reduction in the active duty strength of the Army to 920,000
                        men. This reduction raises a number of questions. It may make it more
                        difficult for us to convince our Allies to increase their conventional war
                        capabilities in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It may diminish
                        significantly the message conveyed by our other military preparations to the
                        Soviets, who are impressed by ground force strength. Further, there is an
                        important efficiency question involved. If there is any substantial
                        probability that future re-examination of the ultimate size of the Army
                        would lead to a higher requirement than 14 divisions, it would seem wasteful
                        to reduce and then increase its size in the course of the next year or two.
                        This in turn raises the question of the extent to which, in fixing the
                        ultimate size of the Army, it is wise to rely on calling up and then
                        demobilizing reserves as crises arise, if, as seems likely, crises will
                        occur with fair frequency in the future.</p>
                    <p>6. With respect to the size of the Army, the proposed alternate program is to
                        recommend that the Berlin augmentation be maintained in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 and that otherwise the Secretary's
                        program for strengthening the logistic support and tactical air complement
                        of the present force be carried out. This would involve not only keeping the
                        Army at the level of 16 divisions with 970,000 men. Further, the proposed
                        Planning Guidelines should not now be issued, and the Department of Defense
                        should be instructed to produce an analysis and proposed Planning Guideline
                        for the period 1964-67 early next year. At that point, the question of
                        phasing down can be examined in the light of a clear conception of what our
                        ultimate goals are.</p>

                    <p>2. In favor of continuing the Nike-Zeus program in some form is the fact that
                        this is the only system in sight before 1970 which offers a possibility of
                        intercepting <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s over cities. Even its
                        critics agree that it should be able to deal with current non-decoyed <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s of the type which we are producing. They
                        also recognize that improvements can be injected into the program while
                        production is taking place.</p>
                    <p>A deployment of Nike-Zeus should have a very considerable psychological
                        effect on our own people and upon the Soviet war planners. At a minimum, it
                        will drive the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to a decoy program that
                        will be both expensive and restrictive upon the useful payload of their
                        missile warheads.</p>
                    <p>3. On the other hand, it is admitted that the development of decoys will
                        present the Zeus missile-makers with a serious problem. A decoyed attack
                        will result in a significant shrinkage of the area which can be protected by
                        a single Nike battery. The radius of effective coverage will be reduced from
                        75 miles to something considerably less—perhaps as little <pb n="215"
                            xml:id="pg_215" facs="0247"/>as 20 miles—and under certain conditions
                        the present defense system could be penetrated. Later developments can
                        offset these disabilities somewhat by increasing the velocity of the Nike
                        missile so that the time for an effective attack is reduced and more time
                        can be allowed for discrimination. The R&amp;D people can always point out
                        how much this can be improved with further research. But if we wait for the
                        ultimate system we shall be permanently undefended.</p>
                    <p>4. On balance, it appears to me sensible to do two things: to embark upon a
                        limited initial production program for Nike-Zeus, and to accelerate research
                        and development on the radar and missile improvements already in sight with
                        a view toward incorporating them in the later production models. This course
                        has the advantages of affording some protection for certain of our cities,
                        of doing something to offset any psychological gains the Soviets might
                        achieve from their announcement of an anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>, and of hedging our bets on future improvements. There is
                        no reason to announce now where the missile sites will be located; rather,
                        the batteries should be distributed according to a site priority established
                        by <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss>. While there conceivably is a
                        danger that public opinion would occasion a runaway on the part of the
                        program, there is certainly nothing inevitable about such a development,
                        especially if the Zeus program is brought into prior relation to the
                        offensive elements of our strategic weapon systems, and with civil defense
                        programs as well. The important thing is to embark upon the Nike-Zeus
                        production with enthusiasm and confidence. We have past expressions of
                        pessimism to offset if we are to get a solid psychological return from the
                        decision to go into production.</p>

                        <item>One of the most important questions posed by the 1963 Budget is the
                            adequacy of the support accorded conventional forces. There is no doubt
                            that this budget makes more ample provisions for this type of force than
                            the previous Eisenhower budgets. But the inadequacy of the support in
                            previous years accentuates the need for a drastic reversal of former
                            budget patterns and a heavy weighing of effort to compensate for this
                            past neglect. Is the 1963 Budget doing enough in light of these
                            considerations?</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The effectiveness of our conventional war forces depends upon several
                            factors: their size, modernization and quantity of equipment, mobility,
                            and geographical location. <list>

                                        decision to retain a 16-division Army structure along with a
                                        3-division Marine Corps provides a divisional structure
                                        which will meet anticipated strategic needs within
                                        acceptable limits of risk. However, this structure needs to
                                        be filled with adequate trained manpower. The Army considers
                                        that it needs 1,055,700 men to support this 16-division
                                        program, whereas the Secretary of Defense is now proposing
                                        roughly 960,000.</p>
                                    <p>It is my understanding that the principal difference between
                                        these two figures is represented by the 39,000
                                        reinforcements which have been sent recently to Europe to
                                        make our present deployments combat ready. I feel that these
                                        men should be kept there as they are necessary for sustained
                                        combat. We are not justified to place our troops in the
                                        presence of the enemy without giving them all the means
                                        necessary to defend themselves.</p></item>

                                        necessary to support a war prior to the availability of new
                                        production. At the present time, as a result of logistical
                                        shortages, it is doubtful that we could sustain more than
                                        three or four divisions in action for a significant period
                                        in a distant theater such as Southeast Asia while retaining

                                        Budget should contain all the funds necessary for an

                                        reserve stockages.</p>
                                    <p>The Army is receiving 2.6 billion in new money to apply
                                        against its shortages. Something over a billion dollars of
                                        this sum is necessary to offset wearout and obsolescence.
                                        Only a little more than a billion is thus available to

                                <item><p><hi rend="italic">Mobility and Location</hi>. The mobility
                                        of conventional forces depends both upon their means of
                                        transport and their location in relation to areas of
                                        employment. The present budget properly emphasizes the need
                                        to improve strategic air transport. It does not, however,
                                        advance the cause of strategic sea lift. At a minimum, some
                                        troop ships and heavy lift cargo vessels should remain in
                                        the active fleet under centralized <gloss target="#t_MSTS1"
                                            >MSTS</gloss> control and the program for roll on-roll
                                        off cargo ships of one per year should be protected.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, because of its vastness special measures to
                                        increase mobility are necessary in the Pacific in order to
                                        reduce the reaction time of conventional forces,
                                        particularly of Army forces. One such measure should be the
                                        location of an Army division in the Western Pacific,
                                        probably in the Philippines. Another measure would be the
                                        preparation of one of our Korean divisions for rapid
                                        strategic movement. This action would require the
                                        replacement by Americans of the Korean personnel now in the
                                        structure of one of the American divisions and the
                                        preparation of plans to permit its rapid transport from
                                        Korea to some other part of the Pacific area.</p></item>

                            divisions as these are the easy units for assessing conventional
                            strength. Also, those elements of the Marines, Navy and Air Force which
                            contribute to conventional war-making should receive corresponding
                            attention. In particular, consideration should be given to increasing
                            the Air Force manpower to maintain on active status the present tactical
                            fighter units which are due to return to an inactive status following

                        Budget (Attachment A).</p>
                    <p>You will note that, whereas the 16-division level was agreed to, apparently
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that this
                        could be done within a 960,000 manning level. This would be about 175,000
                        below current force levels and about 100,000 below what I understand are the
                        service recommendations. How this can be done, of course, remains to be
                        seen. If such economy of personnel can in fact be obtained it will be most
                        desirable. However, our proper concern in State is how the matter comes out
                        publicly. If it comes out in the form of a 16-division force it would meet
                        our purposes. However, as I understand the budget presentation, it is likely
                        to come out in terms of the manning level and, therefore, in terms of a <pb
                            n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0252"/>very marked reduction below our
                        current force levels. This has obviously serious implications with respect
                        to our current Berlin strategy, both in its effects on the Soviet Union and
                        on our allies.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that you discuss the matter in the foregoing terms with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>

                                major decision was to omit mobile Minutemen. This reflects the
                                consensus judgment that the GWO category was too large. The mobile
                                Minuteman was considered the least soundly justified of the various
                                components within this category.</item>

                            <item><p><hi rend="italic">General War Defensive Forces</hi>. The 12
                                    battery Nike-Zeus program was approved. Apparently the so-called
                                    six city program as such, was not agreed to. I take it that this
                                    means that the Research and Development and the Production will
                                    move forward on the 12 battery program, but that the deployment
                                    of the missiles is left open.</p>
                                <p>A Civil Defense program of $700 million per annum, projected over
                                    a five year period (for a total of $3.5 billion) was agreed to.
                                    As I understand it this represents the mid-range as between a
                                    $400 million proposed program and a $900 million program. The
                                    lower end of the range would involve maximum individual self
                                    help efforts. The $700 million range adds to this, assistance to
                                    selected institutions in meeting civil defense requirements
                                    (e.g. hospitals). The upper end of the range, the $900 million
                                    program, would have included assistance to other major social
                                    institutions (particularly in the industrial area).</p></item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">General Purpose Forces</hi>. The 16, as
                                contrasted to the 14, division level was agreed to. However, the
                                significance of this decision, from a political point of view, was
                                significantly undermined by virtue of the decision reached on the
                                force levels. Apparently, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                    >McNamara</persName> proposed a 960 thousand level for meeting
                                the 16 division requirement. This would be about 100 thousand below
                                the minimum service recommendations and about 175 thousand below
                                current force levels. Apparently the President took the initiative
                                in arguing for a higher level and Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was directed to take
                                another look at the numbers implications. (On this point, however,
                                the best guess seems to be that the likely revised recommendations
                                from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will
                                probably not exceed 980 thousand. In short, we must still accept a
                                fairly sizeable force cut within the new budget.) Finally, there was
                                apparently no discussion of reserves versus regular forces.</item>

                                These were approved for Research and Development purposes, I gather
                                with an expression of a certain amount of reluctance on the part of
                                the President. Interestingly enough, part of the justification for
                                the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> increment was that it
                                would serve to develop a new generation of mobile missiles which
                                would offset the loss of the mobile Minutemen program. By
                                implication this certainly means that some emphasis will be placed
                                on a mobile land-based weapon. There was no indication that sea
                                versus land deployment was discussed.</item>

                    <p>This paper was discussed at the Secretary's Policy Planning Meeting on
                        December 12. Most speakers were not identified by name. The “emphasis on
                        less developed areas drew favorable comment.” While the “idea of a viable
                        community of free nations found favor,” it “was pointed out that the
                        community should not become a pretext for the less savory forms of
                        neutralism.” Also, “the view was advanced that the paper was too much of an
                        essay and not enough of an action paper, but this would be corrected by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s proposal for adding Part
                        II to the paper.” Rostow stated that the issues in Part II should be limited
                        to those of direct concern to the President. (Summary of discussion, drafter

                    <p>[Here follows a table of contents.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi>. This paper outlines a strategy, which
                        could provide a sense of coherence and direction to our total effort in the
                        national security field. It is not intended to furnish a complete guide to
                        every policy action, but rather to provide an over-all doctrine which will
                        be relevant to the more important issues we face. Our decisions on these
                        issues are most likely to be mutually consistent and reinforcing if they are
                        based on a clearly defined strategic doctrine.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">National Objective</hi>. Our basic national purpose is
                        to help in the creation of a world environment in which a nation with values
                        and purposes such as ours can flourish. Such an environment will be one in
                        which countries can concert to promote their progress and security, without
                        losing their freedom in the process. That environment can best be described
                        as a “community of free nations”. A sustained US effort toward this end is
                        needed not only to fulfill our positive purposes but also to defeat the
                        Communist’ attempts to shape in their own image the order which will emerge
                        from the present era of revolutionary change.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I. Needed Tasks</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Constructive Tasks in Less Developed Countries</hi>. The
                        community of free nations must be one in which less developed countries can
                        progress toward becoming modern societies. We should use all the instruments
                        of <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0255"/>national policy—diplomacy,
                        military aid, programming guidance and technical aid, capital assistance,
                        and trade policy—to help them achieve evolutionary modernization. We should
                        give higher priority to this objective than to the promotion of special ties
                        with these countries or to securing their support for our political
                        policies. We should urge other Atlantic countries and Japan to take the same
                        view, and to act vigorously on it.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Defensive Tasks</hi>. The community of free nations must
                        also be made secure against war and aggression. We should meet indirect
                        aggression, the most urgent threat, primarily by strengthening the total
                        capacity of governments under attack to mount effective politico-military
                        programs in defense of their societies.</p>
                    <p>We should use US forces to defeat direct aggression in such a way as to
                        defeat its purposes with minimum risk of escalation. This will require not
                        only substantial and mobile conventional forces but also a reasonably stable
                        over-all strategic situation, i.e., one which is unlikely to degenerate into
                        general nuclear war under the pressure of crises and limited conflicts. We
                        should seek to create such an environment by maintaining an effective,
                        invulnerable, and flexible nuclear striking force and by prosecuting
                        adequate active and passive nuclear defense programs. The same purpose will
                        be served by an arms control policy which looks to feasible stabilizing
                        measures in the near term, e.g., safeguards against war by miscalculation
                        and against nuclear proliferation, as well as to the long-term goal of
                        general and complete disarmament.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. Needed Framework</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Atlantic Community</hi>. To prosecute these
                        constructive and defensive tasks we must mobilize the strength of nations,
                        and groups of nations, which can deploy substantial resources beyond their
                        borders. The European Community is such a grouping; we should vigorously
                        support the movement toward European integration. A major purpose of US
                        foreign policy should be to work toward an effective partnership between
                        Europe and the US, through institutions of the Atlantic Community. We should
                        seek vigorously to strengthen these institutions and the resulting capacity
                        for common action. This partnership should be capable of embracing Japan in
                        the economic sphere at the earliest possible time.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Other Ties Between Free Nations</hi>. We should, at the
                        same time, seek to develop manifold ties, embracing as wide a range of human
                        activities as possible, which will permit the developed and less developed
                        nations to work effectively together, and which will limit their ability to
                        harass each other or to act with utter irresponsibility. We should work to
                        strengthen bilateral ties, regional associations, and the <gloss

                            facs="0256"/>Such relationships are the warp and woof of the community
                        of free nations.</p>
                    <p>7. Relations With Communist Nations. We should try to manage our relations
                        with the Communist nations so that they will not divert us from constructive
                        tasks in the free world, and so that they will promote long-term
                        constructive evolution in the Bloc. To this end:</p>
                    <p>We should seek continuing communication with the Soviets, in business-like
                        attempts to avoid crises and reduce the risk of war, and we should promote
                        exchanges and cooperative ventures conducive to useful change in the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. When crises erupt, we should seek to
                        resolve them in a way which will restore equilibrium without incurring the
                        increased costs and risks that would be required to alter the existing
                        balance of advantage drastically in our favor.</p>
                    <p>We should seek contacts, and extend and encourage assistance, designed to
                        encourage helpful trends in Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>We should move toward policies which will place the onus for continued
                        hostility between Communist China and the US more squarely on Peiping and
                        thus mobilize greater free world support in resisting Chinese Communist
                        expansion. We should try to create a political climate in which the
                        Sino-Soviet rift will prosper; we should not go out of our way to make it
                        look as though <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s
                        preference for negotiation over fighting is a vain one; and we should make
                        clear that the contrary Chinese view, if put to the test, is likely to
                        entail swift disaster.</p>
                    <p>Our response to the Soviet ideological offensive should center upon
                        projecting and explaining our own efforts to build a community of free
                        nations. We should promote a free world consensus on this central goal. We
                        should not be drawn away from this goal by a presumed need to react to
                        Communist political and propaganda initiatives, but should seek to keep the
                        focus where it belongs: on our opportunities and affirmative purposes in the
                        free world.</p>

                    <p>1. The final decisions on the Defense budget are now before you. In making
                        these decisions, you will bear in mind that you are making a choice which
                        will determine expenditures not only in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        63, but for the whole of the rest of your administration. These decisions
                        thus will shape the availability of budget resources for non-military
                        programs for this whole period of time, as well as for next year. For this
                        reason, I recommend that you not concur in the suggestion of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s memorandum of
                        December 7 (attached)<note n="1" xml:id="d63fn1">Not found attached. In it
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that he had
                            that day submitted the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 defense
                            budget to the Bureau of the Budget and that Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> had concurred in his
                            recommendations with a few exceptions. “As we discussed briefly at
                            Hyannis Port, I am proposing to start the funding of 200 fixed Minutemen
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963, an increase of 100 missiles
                            to compensate for the elimination of the mobile Minuteman from the
                            program. Dave would prefer to eliminate mobile Minuteman with no
                            compensating increase.” (Ibid.)</note> with respect to his currently
                        revised force structure. Instead I suggest that you examine carefully the
                        possibility of a lower strategic striking force for the reasons set forth at
                        some length in my memorandum to you of November 22.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d63fn2"><ref target="#d57">Document 57</ref>.</note> Briefly,
                        these reasons are that we do not need as large a force as the <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> proposes to do the military job; and that
                        any error on the side of generosity has the undesirable consequence of
                        stepping up the arms race. In a world of missiles and thermonuclear warheads
                        more arms do not in any simple way add more security. This is not an
                        argument for a smaller force than military need requires, but an argument
                        against adding any substantial margin to what a careful examination of the
                        military situation shows to be necessary.</p>
                    <p>2. I suggest that you consider two alternative programs; one for hardened and
                        dispersed Minuteman and one for Polaris.</p>
                    <p>The alternative Minuteman program would provide for the following force

                    <p>If this appears too drastic a cut for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> to accept, it might be preferable to propose an
                        alternate program which achieved his original goal of 900 hardened and
                        dispersed Minutemen in 1967, but followed the same rate of buildup as the
                        lower program. I propose in the three fiscal years 63, 64 and 65, i.e., a
                        force structure as follows:</p>

                    <p>of military needs without too great a risk as we would become aware of an
                        increase of Soviet missile site construction before their deployment was
                        complete.</p>
                    <p>A slowdown in the rate of procurement and employment of Minuteman forces
                        would bring other significant positive advantages. The missiles now being
                        produced have a number of important technical shortcomings. The goal of 600
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 can be achieved only by a crash
                        program which permits no time for modifications that can deal with some of
                        these shortcomings. It is expected that after these missiles are in place, a
                        fairly expensive retrofit program will be required to bring them up to
                        desirable standards of performance. The slower the rate of buildup now, the
                        less will be the retrofit requirements later, since the missiles deployed
                        later will be able to incorporate improvements in range and penetration aids
                        from the start. Thus, the present program involves a faster buildup on paper
                        than real capability, and a hidden future cost in expensive retrofitting
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>On Polaris, I suggest that the additional procurement rate for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63 be cut to 3 instead of the 6 now proposed
                        and be maintained at 3 per year thereafter. This would cut the 1967 force
                        from 41 to 35, but there would be no change in the number of submarines
                        available before 1965. This change would save $75 million of expenditures in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63.</p>
                    <p>All the proposed changes are slow downs in the rate of buildup in our
                        strategic forces, not in any sense reductions in them. They would not affect
                        the prospective strategic balance between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. Annex I shows the effect of the proposed changes on the
                        total strategic force.</p>
                    <p>3. In addition to these major problems of force structure, there are several
                        other lesser but still important changes from the Secretary's
                        recommendations which ought to be considered.</p>

                        <item>First is the Nike Zeus Program—The case for the Nike Zeus is dubious.
                            If long leadtime production items are funded now, it may be very
                            difficult to resist going ahead with procurement and deployment of this
                            system. It appears desirable to avoid this. Eliminating these items
                            would save $50 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63.</item>
                        <item>Second, in view of the political problems involved in the future

                            desirable to defer the beginnings of development of a specific system
                            until next year. Studies on the comparative merits of land- and
                            sea-based systems, as well as research on command and control, and
                            research and development on stellar guidance will continue at high
                            priority. Postponing the development commitment would save $60 million

                        other members of the Task Force were Edward Lansdale, <persName

                        Council. According to a December 13 memorandum from <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2"
                            >George McGhee</persName>, the members served as individuals, not agency
                        representatives. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_S1"

                            >NSC</gloss> Files: Lot 70 D 265, Dec 61)</p>
                    <p>The report concluded that while there existed a “clear consensus within the
                        U.S. Government as to the magnitude and urgency” of the problem presented by
                        Communist indirect aggression, there was “no single high-level locus of
                        authority and responsibility” to undertake “vitally needed concerting of
                        interagency resources.” The Task Force recommended that this function should
                        be added to the responsibilities of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5412 Special Group, whose Chairman was General Taylor. The Special Group
                        should designate areas where subversive violence was already a “major
                        factor” or a “potentially serious threat.” For “critically threatened”
                        countries as designated by the Special Group, the Secretary of State should
                        establish interagency task forces to develop and review action programs.</p>
                    <p>In a December 12 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge
                            Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Robert Komer</persName>
                        stated that he had pressed for designation of the Special Group in the
                        report because “<persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> is already
                        heavily involved in this problem area, and expansion of Special Group
                        functions builds on a going concern. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1"
                            >Walt</persName> and I touched base with <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName>; he is in full agreement.” To overcome what <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> believed were problems in obtaining
                        interagency concurrence, “the technique we decided on was to have Bissell
                        transmit the report to you so that you could send a chit to the agencies
                        concerned suggesting that we have an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting on it.” In the margin of his own memorandum, <persName

                    <p>In his memorandum for the record of the White House daily staff meeting on
                        December 13, Colonel Ewell stated that <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                            >Bundy</persName> brought up the report and “jumped on the general idea”
                        because he felt it would <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0262"/>downgrade
                        the Secretary of State and the Assistant Secretaries. “I sense that some
                        very quick action is necessary to get this thing back on the track.” In his
                        memorandum of the daily staff meeting on December 15, Ewell wrote: “I
                        mentioned the cold war paper. Bundy said that he had your memorandum from
                        the Special Group. He is generally opposed to the Special Group getting into
                        the consideration of organizational policy. He plans to talk to you about
                        your memorandum. I suspect that <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>
                        has straightforward reservations about the Special Group—cold war idea, and
                        I also feel that he has deep reservations, which are not quite so
                        straightforward, about letting a strong, decisive group get hold of a block
                        of decisions. This tends to inhibit the free-wheelers around here who find
                        that they are unable to tinker around with the approach to a problem if the
                        policy formulation in its final stages is reserved to a small group. My
                        guess would be that the Bundy-Kaysen-Henry Owen axis is initiating a
                        preventive war on this idea and will try to sink it without a trace.” (Both

                        written for the record, Ewell's memoranda were customarily circulated to
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> and his staff. The
                        memorandum from the Special Group has not been found. <persName

                            >Lemnitzer</persName> advocated that the work of the new Special Group
                        should in the long run not be confined to “those areas in which the
                        Communists have already taken root” but should also concentrate on areas of
                        the “most strategic significance to the United States such as Brazil, in
                        which a well-coordinated, effective National Plan for progress should now be

                        highly-qualified staff” of six to eight people to prepare recommendations
                        and do “necessary spade work to permit monitoring the over-all

                            a concept for a broad program that would contribute to long-range

                    </list>
                    <p>The President is concerned that we may be missing an opportunity this year to
                        develop methods for supporting whatever contribution military forces can
                        make to economic and social development in less-developed countries. While
                        recognizing that civic action is not universally applicable, he hopes we
                        will take full advantage of its contribution in crisis areas as well as in
                        those where the threat of subversion is more remote.</p>
                    <p>By civic action we mean using military forces on projects useful to the
                        populace at all levels in such fields as training, public works,
                        agriculture, transportation, communication, health, sanitation, and others
                        helpful to economic development.</p>
                    <p>In countries fighting active campaigns against internal subversion, we should
                        encourage local forces to undertake civic action projects as indispensable
                        means of strengthening their society's economic base and establishing a link
                        between army and populace. In countries threatened by external aggression,
                        local forces should participate in civic action projects which do not
                        materially impair performance of the primary military mission. In countries
                        where subversion or attack is less imminent, selected military forces can
                        contribute substantially to economic and social development, and we should
                        make such a contribution a major function of these forces.</p>
                    <p>The President hopes that we can include civic action projects in existing and
                        future military and economic assistance programs wherever <pb n="232"
                            xml:id="pg_232" facs="0264"/>practicable and in guidance that will
                        affect future planning. He realizes we will have to develop new procedures
                        for supporting this sort of project but feels that the benefits to be gained
                        in some countries warrant considerable effort on our part. In an emergency,
                        we should also consider using U.S. training teams as catalysts for a more
                        rapid or substantial reorientation.</p>
                    <p>We must coordinate civic action with other programs directed at the same
                        goals. A number of programs—economic and military assistance, political
                        reform, paramilitary activities, police training, Peace Corps, and
                        others—have common goals, but each can make a unique contribution. The
                        President hopes that you might include civic action in any comprehensive
                        study made in connection with <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No.

                        programs, and other aspects of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        financial situation, and was sure that the reduction of $200 million in

                        programs.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the discussion on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> the
                        President emphasized the importance of military assistance to Latin American
                        countries and the care that should be taken in selecting Military Attaches
                        and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s in that area.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> stated that the Army
                        had been “done well by” in the proposed budget although he considered the
                        personnel ceiling fairly tight and regretted that the PEMA appropriation
                        would not be larger. He noted the Army's position as favoring the earliest
                        possible go-ahead on Nike-Zeus production. He agreed that the program for
                        reorienting the Reserves had military advantages but pointed out the
                        difficulties that would be encountered in reducing the number of National
                        Guard or Reserve Divisions. In response to the President's inquiry, General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> discussed the problems
                        related to the early release of the 32d Infantry and 49th Armored National
                        Guard divisions.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> expressed the
                        reservation of the Air Force on the long-range plans for strategic forces
                        which he believes will result in dangerously lowering in the time period
                        after 1965 the present U.S. nuclear superiority in strategic weapons. In
                        particular, he made the point that in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘63
                        an additional 100 hardened and dispersed Minutemen should be funded<note

                        authority for long-lead time construction for sites for missiles that would
                        be ordered in future years, and the further point that at the very least the
                        B-70 development <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0266"/>should be
                        permitted to proceed immediately on a full weapon system basis.</p>
                    <p>In commenting on General <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>'s
                        statement the President said that he would be happy to hear General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>'s presentation on the
                        subject of the strategic force structure, but he pointed out that the Air
                        Force should be prepared to support its position by showing how additional
                        strategic forces would improve the overall military posture of the U.S. vs.
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> made it clear that the decision
                        on strategic force levels was not dictated by availability of funds or other
                        budgetary considerations.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> expressed the
                        gratification of the Air Force that the new budget would provide it with
                        five more fighter wings and significant increases in airlift capacity.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of overseas dependents both the President and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stressed the significance of the
                        balance of payments problem and the alternatives which the U.S. faces if
                        military contributions to the current balance of payments deficit were not
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> said that the new
                        budget will support a “better Navy” and that the Navy can “live with the
                        budget” although maintenance and personnel funds will continue to be tight.
                        He also stated the case for the new carrier proposed in the budget and
                        summarized the reasons for accepting conventional rather than nuclear
                        propulsion for the carrier. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1"
                            >Anderson</persName> commented on the shortage of military construction
                        funds and the consequent adverse impact on shore stations. He also discussed
                        the problem presented by the recent expansion of 40 anti-submarine warfare
                            (<gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>) ships and 18 <gloss
                            target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> squadrons which are not provided for in the
                        1963 budget.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> stated that the current
                        budget had been better prepared than any previous military financial program
                        he had witnessed in the last seven years. He expressed his concern which Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> shared, over the importance of
                        proof-testing new weapons (including warheads).<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2"
                            >In a memorandum for record of the White House daily staff meeting on
                            January 5, 1962, Ewell stated that he briefed the group on the Palm
                            Beach conferences. “I deliberately told them about <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName>'s comments on not knowing
                            whether missiles would work, and added that this was kicked around the
                            table a bit and there was general agreement that there would be some
                            systems tests in the new testing program.” (National Defense University,

                    <p>I am not satisfied that the Department of Defense, and in particular the
                        Army, is according the necessary degree of attention and effort to the
                        threat of Communist-directed subversive insurgency and guerrilla warfare,
                        although it is clear that these constitute a major form of politico-military
                        conflict for which we must carefully prepare. The effort devoted to this
                        challenge should be comparable in importance to preparations for
                        conventional warfare.</p>
                    <p>I would like you to assure that this new attitude is reflected in the
                        organization, training, equipment and doctrine of the United States Armed
                        Forces, at home and abroad. As I suggested above, at this time I do not see
                        that this degree of effort is being made. The Army has a particularly
                        important role to play, and I would like to find recognition of this
                        importance in Army organization and training. As an immediate step, I should
                        like an Army general officer serving in the immediate area of the Chief of
                        Staff to be designated as the focal point for Army activities directed at
                        this problem. I should like another general officer designated in the Joint
                        Staff to perform a corresponding function there.<note n="1" xml:id="d67fn1"
                            >In a January 24 memorandum to the President on counterinsurgency,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that the
                            Army had selected Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_RWB1">William

                            counterinsurgency had been named to the Joint Staff pending a regular
                            appointment. (Ibid.)</note> I leave it to your judgment whether similar
                        action is necessary in the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.</p>

                            <persName>Kennedy</persName>'s questions were answered in a memorandum
                            from Decker to <persName corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName> dated
                            February 26. (All ibid.) On February 19, the Department of Defense
                            circulated a status report on “Guerrilla Warfare and Related Matters.”

                    <p>Even before having the benefit of this report, I am sure that the Department
                        of Defense and the Services should be making a thorough <pb n="236"
                            xml:id="pg_236" facs="0268"/>review of the training programs for
                        officers, beginning at the Service academy level and carrying through to the
                        National War College, to determine whether sufficient attention is being
                        paid to instruction in subversive insurgency and related forms of indirect
                        aggression. I have previously directed the Army to send selected officers to
                        South Viet-Nam for short periods of orientation and training in order to
                        expose them to the experience of actual conditions of guerrilla warfare. I
                        would like that program expedited and appropriate officers of the other
                        Services included.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I have directed that the Armed Forces consider giving special
                        training and orientation on guerrilla warfare (and the political
                        implications thereof in countries where Communist threats are evident) for
                        those officers being assigned to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>'s and
                        as attaches to countries where Communist subversive threats are apparent. To
                        accomplish this, it would seem that a period of training at the Army Special
                        Warfare Center, prior to departure for their posts, would be appropriate in
                        many cases.</p>
                    <p>As you perceive from my foregoing remarks, in preparing to meet “wars of
                        liberation” I should like the Department of Defense to move to a new level
                        of increased activity across the board. I expect to direct similar action in
                        other executive departments which have a part to play in this matter.</p>

                    <p>The President began his general discussion of policy problems by expressing
                        his gratitude to all for their work during 1961. He expressed the hope that
                        all concerned would move ahead in the same spirit of increasing cooperation
                        during 1962.</p>
                    <p>The President referred to the Council's responsibility for integrating the
                        work of the Departments of State and Defense and the Central Intelligence
                        Agency, with the participation of the Treasury Department and other agencies
                        when matters of interest to them were being considered. He asked the members
                        to cooperate in making the Council meetings useful, <pb n="239"
                            xml:id="pg_239" facs="0271"/>and ensuring that decisions arising out of
                        the Council meetings were effectively carried out.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that he had stated the objective of the United States
                        in his State of the Union Message as being the encouragement of a world of
                        free and independent countries. The independence of countries sometimes
                        created problems like those of Yugoslavia and Ghana. Our relations to such
                        countries could never be like those of the Soviet Union to its satellites.
                        We would simply have to live with these difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we have an enormous task, in that our responsibilities are
                        world-wide and of great complexity. The British and the French, formerly
                        world powers, are concentrating more and more on problems of Europe,
                        especially as the Common Market develops. This throws increasing weight on
                        us, and it is no wonder that we do not always succeed. When you think only
                        of our problems in Laos, Ghana, the Congo and Latin America, you can
                        recognize the magnitude of the limitations upon what a country with only 6%
                        of the world's population can accomplish.</p>
                    <p>These problems have a high degree of interrelation, in that the political and
                        military factors tie closely together. Thus, for example, the coming fight
                        on U.S. trade policy involves military interests very directly. If we cannot
                        keep up our export surplus, we shall not have the dollar exchange with which
                        to meet our overseas military commitments. We are spending $3 billion a year
                        abroad to maintain our international security position. We must either do a
                        good job of selling abroad or pull back. Our balance of payments position
                        has put a strain on our gold reserves, and while we are not at a point of
                        danger, we are at a point of concern. If confidence in the dollar is not
                        maintained, those holding dollar and gold obligations against us could
                        easily create grave difficulties for us. Any bank in which confidence is
                        weakened faces great dangers. The over-all importance of the balance of
                        payments position to our military security can be understood still more
                        clearly by noting the British experience. The British pull-back of forces
                        from numerous bases throughout the world in the years since World War II has
                        been very largely a response to balance of payments difficulties. We see
                        further pressure of this sort causing British planners to undertake further
                        military reductions overseas.</p>
                    <p>Turning to basic military policy the President remarked that we relied on our
                        nuclear deterrent. There are a number of places where our strength on the
                        ground does not match what the Communists can bring to bear, but they hold
                        back because they think we might use the bomb if they pushed us hard enough.
                        As of now, the credibility of our nuclear deterrent is sufficient to hold
                        our present positions throughout the world. Because Soviet nuclear strength
                        is developing, great emphasis must be placed on other kinds of reinforcement
                        of our military position.</p>
                    <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0272"/>
                    <p>In commenting on the nature of the Soviet threat, the President called
                        attention to the January 6, 1961, speech by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>, which he described as possibly one of the most
                        important speeches of the decade. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> had made clear the pattern of military and
                        paramilitary infiltration and subversion which could be expected under the
                        guise of “wars of liberation.”<note n="1" xml:id="d69fn1">For extracts from
                            the speech, delivered before a meeting of Party organizations of the
                            Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow, see American Foreign
                            Policy: Current Documents, 1961, pp. 555-558.</note> The President
                        believed that in response we must strengthen our conventional forces and our
                        capability for military leadership in dealing with that kind of war. This
                        was a matter which required imaginative and outstanding new efforts by all
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>The President specifically praised the discussion of this problem in the
                        January 1962 issue of the Marine Corps Gazette. He felt that all
                        forces—Army, Marine, Air and Navy—must learn how to fight on the edges of
                        the world. The record of the Romans made clear that their success was
                        dependent on their will and ability to fight successfully at the edges of
                        their empire. It was not so clear that we were yet in a position to do the
                        same.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, there were special unsolved problems. When the Chinese get missiles
                        and bombs and nuclear weapons, for example, what effect will that have on
                        our dispositions in Southeast Asia?</p>
                    <p>Turning to aid policy, the President emphasized that we wanted to be sure to
                        have military aid programs and military aid officers who would be alert to
                        the real problems faced in the countries to which they were assigned. The
                        basic danger was usually that of seizure from inside by Communist forces
                        supported by military or paramilitary efforts within and without. The
                        President believed that U.S. military personnel should establish the closest
                        possible relations with military men in the countries to which they are
                        assigned so that there could be mutual trust and, above all, understanding
                        of the real dangers with which the military forces in that country must be
                        prepared to cope—the dangers of subversion and Communist insurgency within
                        the country. The President believed in particular that more emphasis was
                        needed on military assistance to Latin America. He cited the example of
                        President Betancourt of Venezuela who needs such assistance to safeguard his
                        position with the military which may hold the balance of power in that
                        country.</p>
                    <p>The President emphasized that chiefs of U.S. military missions and U.S.
                        Military Attachés occupy extraordinarily important positions. Such U.S.
                        officers should not act as lobbyists against Washington by always seeking
                        increasing amounts of military assistance. The task of U.S. military
                        officers is to influence their opposite numbers. For example, in Iran we
                        would not wish our military men encouraging the Shah of Iran in <pb n="241"
                            xml:id="pg_241" facs="0273"/>resisting a decision to reduce their armed
                        forces to 150,000 men. We do not want our military men making the Iranians
                        any more unhappy than they already are.</p>
                    <p>In concluding this section of his remarks, the President emphasized again the
                        importance of cooperation among all departments and agencies concerned with
                        national security. He thought such cooperation had been very good and he was
                        grateful for it. He cited as an example the interdepartmental efforts to
                        improve the situation in the Dominican Republic. “We are partners,” he said,
                        “by necessity and choice.”</p>
                    <p>In a brief response, the Secretary of State expressed the gratitude of all
                        present for the chance to serve under the President in working on these
                        great issues. The Secretary noted the surging thrust of nationalism
                        throughout the world and expressed his belief that it was proving a tough
                        and resistant force against Communist imperialism. He noted in particular
                        the President's policy of understanding and support for free and independent
                        nations in all continents, and he said that all would wish to commit
                        themselves afresh to the service of the Administration in these
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>The President then spoke about the following specific items:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">West Irian</hi>. The area is a most unsuitable one for a
                        war in which the United States would be involved. We would not wish to
                        humiliate the Dutch, but on the other hand it would be foolish to have a
                        contest when the Dutch really do want to get out if a dignified method can
                        be found. We should recognize that this territory was likely eventually to
                        go to Indonesia, even though we ourselves might deeply dislike Sukarno as an
                        individual. The real stake here was not West Irian but the fate of
                        Indonesia, the most rich and populous country in the area and one which was
                        the target of energetically pursued Soviet ambitions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam</hi>. A really tough case in which the immediate
                        problem is how to cut off a Communist supply line, and in which he knew
                        there was intense and cooperative effort by the departments concerned.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Laos</hi>. A problem on which there might be serious
                        disagreement. After careful weighing of the risks and an examination of the
                        supply problem, where there was no seaport, we have decided to disengage—to
                        move toward a solution in terms of a neutral and independent Laos. We are
                        continuing in this direction, and we hope that Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, who is working on this problem,
                        will be able to work out an effective solution.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Cuba</hi>. We hope that Castro can be effectively isolated
                        at the coming meeting at Punta del Este,<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">At their
                            meeting at Punta del Este, Uruguay, held January 22-31, the Foreign
                            Ministers of the Organization of American States voted to exclude Cuba
                            from the Organization.</note> but we expect this to continue to be a
                        very <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0274"/>large problem on which further
                        action might be necessary. The time has not yet come when we must force a
                        solution to the Cuban problem.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi>. There had been no progress in the negotiation
                        up to this point. If that situation persisted, the Soviets could be expected
                        to proceed with a separate peace treaty and there might be a direct test of
                        nerves in the Spring. At such a point the responsibility on the military
                        would be increasingly great. We have to control the developing situation
                        from Washington and a heavy responsibility would rest on the President, the
                        Secretaries of State and Defense, and the military commanders. The President
                        believed that it was important to have prompt and careful study of our
                        contingency plans and to think hard about the ways and means of making
                        decisions that might lead to nuclear war. If there were to be any such war,
                        we must know what it is for, and know what other steps we can take before
                        such war comes.</p>
                    <p>The President then turned to the subject of relations with the press. He
                        thought there were still too many stories appearing which should not have
                        been given to reporters. We do better than others, and the President
                        referred specifically to Bonn and Paris as the worst offenders. But we
                        should improve our own security. We ought not to circulate important papers
                        and cables in a casual way. We ought to be sure that matters on which there
                        may be differences in the Government are not made public if we can avoid it.
                        The President believed that there had been fewer interagency struggles and
                        squabbles in this Administration than in any of which he was aware in recent
                        times. He hoped that this good record could be maintained and improved.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in remarks that were actually given at the opening of the second
                        part of the meeting, the President stated that there were still a number of
                        problems on which study, recommendation and decision took too long. He noted
                        in particular the case of policy toward Yugoslavia. Recommendations had been
                        requested at an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting three months
                        before, and the matter had come to him for decision only this week. Yet it
                        was not that difficult, and the solution was a relatively simple compromise.
                        The President instructed his own staff and the departments concerned to
                        avoid such delays in the future.<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">The President's

                        entitled “Basic National Security Policy.” A draft of February 7, 1962, was
                        circulated within the Department of State only. (Department of State, <gloss

                        February 14, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> described the
                        draft as “more analytical than the somewhat oracular texts of earlier basic
                        national security policy papers” and suggested that it might either be
                        circulated by the President after <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review
                        as an interim guidance, or that a shorter version might be prepared “in the
                        style of an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Record of Action.” Rostow
                        believed, however, “that it would be difficult to eliminate explanatory
                        material without leaving the policy prescription cryptic or open to serious
                        misunderstanding.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>A version dated February 24 is 193 double-spaced pages long. (Ibid., <gloss

                    <p>The March 26 draft, like its two predecessors, opens with an exposition of
                        “Doctrine,” or fundamental objectives, and proceeds to a section on
                        “Strategy,” or means of implementing these objectives. A third section sets
                        forth specific national security planning tasks, while the fourth and last
                        section details a procedure for anticipating crises.</p>
                    <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0276"/>
                    <p>Part One on “Doctrine” sets forth as the major “constructive goal” of U.S.
                        policy an evolving international “free community,” defined as one in which
                        nations effectively cooperate “in their areas of interdependence,” move
                        forward “in their own ways” toward governments based on “consent and
                        individual freedom,” regularly progress in social justice, settle disputes
                        peaceably, increasingly participate in supernational institutions “which
                        transcend and, to some extent, limit the independent powers of the
                        nation-state,” and “move progressively” toward an international legal order.
                        U.S. military power must remain at the center of this community to deal with
                        “the flexible arsenal of Communist techniques of aggression” and to support
                        “diplomatic efforts to curb anarchic nationalist impulses.” Within this
                        framework of U.S. and allied military power, the United States should work
                        for the attainment of the community objectives listed above.</p>
                    <p>The five major “dimensions” outlined in Part Two on “Strategy” were military
                        policy, policy in the underdeveloped areas, a “framework of organization,”
                        policy toward Communist states, and the “national [U.S.] base.”</p>
                    <p>Regarding the scale of U.S. strategic retaliatory forces, the paper states
                        that they should be “sufficiently ready and effective so that Sino-Soviet
                        leaders would expect—without question—the Bloc's power position to be
                        worsened drastically as a result of a general nuclear war.” They must be
                        “sufficiently invulnerable” so that their survival would not depend on a
                        first strike and controllable enough so that automatic response to perceived
                        threats would not increase the danger of war by miscalculation. In “general
                        war, nuclear weapons will be used from the outset, as determined in advance
                        by the President and subject to his direction and control.” Concerning the
                        first strike problem, the paper weighs many issues and concludes that while
                        the United States should not “lock” itself “into first strike plans and
                        assumptions,” it should not “so preclude the possibility of launching the
                        first nuclear blow as to deny ourselves the deterrent advantage of Soviet
                        uncertainty on this point.” The paper states also that the United States
                        “should not set an absolute requirement that [its] strategic forces be able
                        substantially to destroy all Soviet delivery systems in a first strike.” The
                        paper advocates sufficient civil defense to prevent “unnecessary casualties
                        from fall-out” but cautions against “generating unwarranted expectations as
                        to what such programs can accomplish.”</p>
                    <p>General purpose forces were to be of increased mobility and capable of
                        containing “non-nuclear aggression short of all-out Soviet or Chinese
                        Communist attack, without using nuclear” weapons. “If a balance must be
                        struck in the training and equipping of these forces as between non-nuclear
                        and nuclear combat, that balance should be struck in favor of non-nuclear
                        combat.” A major effort in anti-guerrilla forces, both U.S. <pb n="245"
                            xml:id="pg_245" facs="0277"/>and allied, was necessary and it would “not
                        be sufficient to make counter-guerrilla policy an ancillary objective to be
                        pursued only insofar as it does not interfere with more conventional
                        objectives.” While U.S. objectives should be attained whenever possible
                        without nuclear weapons, enemy use of them or overwhelming enemy advantage
                        in conventional forces might compel their use. In such cases, “the primary
                        purpose of the use of a small number of nuclear weapons would be political,
                        rather than military—to convey a signal of U.S. intent” to widen the war, if
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>The United States had an interest in arms control and disarmament for the
                        following reasons: a second-strike deterrent could be maintained at lower
                        levels of delivery capability if Soviet reductions in arms matched those of
                        the United States; growing Soviet nuclear capacity; the growing possibility
                        of an expensive nuclear stalemate; the “statistically real if, on the whole,
                        unlikely” possibility of war by accident; and the possibility of nuclear
                        proliferation. Current arms control objectives should “complement our
                        military policy through promoting a stable military environment.”</p>
                    <p>In the underdeveloped world, the United States had a military interest in
                        seeing nations not fall under Communist control, an ideological interest in
                        seeing them “evolve in directions” which would “afford a congenial world
                        environment for our own society,” and an economic interest that “the
                        resources and the markets of these areas are available to us and to the
                        other industrialized nations of the free world.” Toward these ends the draft
                        paper advocated such measures as fine-tuning economic and military aid to
                        the needs of particular countries and encouraging the remaining colonial
                        powers to withdraw gracefully. “In general our basic orientation must be to
                        the modern, progressive, and popularly-based groups within the
                        underdeveloped areas; however, we must recognize that the rise to power of
                        such groups will be a slow and uneven process, and that we may, on occasion,
                        have to accommodate ourselves to less desirable situations.”</p>
                    <p>The “framework of organization” referred to alliance systems, economic
                        organizations, the United Nations, and all other international organizations
                        that would serve to “weave together the countries of the free community,
                        draw closer those of the Communist Bloc, and pave the way for the stronger
                        international organizations” which were “essential to the evolutionary
                        development of the free community.” The “first and highest priority mission”
                        was to “bind the United States into effective partnership with Europe,
                        Canada, and Japan in the major tasks of defense and modernization within the
                        community of free nations.” The paper terms these nations “the northern hard
                        core.” Goals regarding Europe include European political integration without
                        destroying the Atlantic Community or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                        a corresponding reduction in the U.S.-U.K. “special relationship,” several
                        of the nuclear sharing schemes then <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0278"
                        />under discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, opposition to
                        additional national nuclear programs, and encouragement of the United
                        Kingdom to phase out its independent strategic nuclear program in favor of
                        its participation in a multilateral one.</p>
                    <p>Even though Japan lacked “the domestic political base” to play as great a
                        defense role as the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States should
                        “engage Japanese energies and resources within the free community” so that
                        “this powerful nation, moving forward at an extraordinary rate” would find
                        “a role of dignified world responsibility.” This engagement should take
                        place “in the whole area from Karachi to Seoul,” in Japan's bilateral
                        relations with the United States, and “in the common enterprises of the
                        north which fall within the work of the OECD.”</p>
                    <p>Concerning <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> the paper
                        observes that “the efforts of the United States to pool the military
                        resources of the area and to provide a feeling of security through regional
                        alliances have not worked out too well,” and suggests that the United
                        States, while continuing to support them “for the time being,” should “seek
                        to promote other, more broadly-based, and less defense-oriented regional
                        links,” with military emphasis being on counter-guerrilla operations.</p>
                    <p>The paper expresses general support for the United Nations but notes that
                        “the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can and should only play an ancillary
                        role in the major security issues in conflict between East and West.” When
                        necessary, the United States should risk “running against the current moods
                        and habits in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Assembly” in support of
                        its commitments.</p>
                    <p>Regarding Communist regimes, the draft states that there was both a “new
                        assertiveness,” which stemmed from a growing Soviet military power, and “a
                        certain mellowing” of Soviet policy during the post-Stalin period, partly
                        because of realistic Soviet appreciation of the consequences of nuclear war.
                        It was hence necessary to maintain “a constructive as well as a militant
                        track in relations with Communist regimes.” Fragmentation within the Bloc
                        would in time “open increased opportunities to deal with Communist nations
                        constructively in terms of limited areas in which our national interests
                        overlap with theirs.”</p>
                    <p>In crises, the United States should “try to meet immediate threats in ways
                        which, if possible, reinforce the long-term direction of our policy and
                        minimize the diversionary consequences of our reactions;” for instance, in
                        “the Vietnamese crisis, to increase the degree of mutual involvement and
                        support among non-Communist nations in Asia.” Regarding relaxation of
                        tensions, while the United States should “welcome temporary and partial
                        accommodations or detentes,” it “should not be diverted by them” from its
                        long-term strategy. The long-term purpose of U.S. policy was to “increase
                        the chance of constructive evolution within that society which might
                        eventually move it to participate in the <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247"
                            facs="0279"/>community of free nations.” The “natural forces of
                        fragmentation” in the Bloc made “this long-run hope not wholly
                        illusory.”</p>
                    <p>With Eastern Europe, the United States should seek to broaden its contacts
                        and therefore “should play ‘liberation’ in low key,” in order to promote
                        “gradual progress” toward an eventual goal of Eastern European countries
                        becoming “members of the free community by a process of peaceful evolution.”
                        Regarding China, the paper called for avoiding provocations, “informal
                        negotiations” on minor subjects, and doing nothing which might have the
                        effect of halting the Sino-Soviet split: “we should not so openly favor
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s point of view as to
                        make it difficult for him to justify it within the Communist camp.” The
                        United States “should make clear” that Sino-U.S. relations could be
                        normalized if China modified “its aggressive stance and behavior” and
                        recognized “de facto the existence of an independent Taiwan.” Removal of the
                        Nationalist Government from the offshore islands (without diluting otherwise
                        the U.S. military commitment to it) should be “a high priority objective,”
                        and the United States should promote the emergence on Taiwan of a “political
                        process increasingly based on popular consent.”</p>
                    <p>In the section on “The Domestic Base,” the paper called for high domestic
                        growth, “not because rapid growth itself has inherent virtue” but because “a
                        flow of increasing resources” would raise the standard of living, permit the
                        United States to deal with its military responsibilities, and provide a
                        context of prosperity which would make a liberal trading system acceptable
                        to Congress.</p>
                    <p>Part Three of the draft paper treats “national security tasks,” which were
                        “major unsolved problems” identified in the course of drafting Parts One and
                        Two. Twenty-five tasks are listed, such as <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> nuclear strategy, the military role in underdeveloped
                        areas, policy toward the Sino-Soviet split, the future of Japan, and U.S.
                        productivity.</p>
                    <p>Part Four, “The Anticipation of Crises,” lists 52 potential crises for
                        advance study in the hope of swiftly executing policy if the need arose.
                        Suggested topics include succession crises in the Soviet Union, China,
                        Spain, Portugal, and a number of other countries; “anti-regime” outbreaks in
                        the German Democratic Republic; Soviet intervention in Albania; threatened
                        Communist takeover in Cyprus; military action in the Arab-Israeli conflict;
                        assassination of King Hussein of Jordan; Ghanaian aggression against Togo,
                        Portuguese defeat in Angola; resurgent neutralism in Japan; and a Peronist
                        return to power in Argentina.</p>

                        for such programs are “fuzzy”, and there are many differing views as to what
                        kinds of police programs, if any, the US should support.</p>
                    <p>The Group should press on <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> that
                        it regards police programs, including equipment where necessary, as needing
                        the same type of renewed emphasis which we are currently giving to Special
                        Forces and other aspects of the overall counter-insurgency effort. Given the
                        checkered history of these programs in the aid agency, we might ask
                            <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName> to consider whether
                        giving them semi-autonomy within <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                        earmarking their funds separately, and re-centralizing the police function
                        under him personally might not be essential to protect them adequately.

                    <p>As you know, I desire the appropriate agencies of this Government to give
                        utmost attention and emphasis to programs designed to counter Communist
                        indirect aggression, which I regard as a grave threat during the 1960s. I
                        have already written the Secretary of Defense “to move to a new level of
                        increased activity across the board” in the counter-insurgency field.<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d72fn1"><ref target="#d67">Document 67</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Police assistance programs, including those under the aegis of your agency,
                        are also a crucial element in our response to this challenge. I understand
                        that there has been some tendency toward de-emphasizing them under the new
                        aid criteria developed by your agency. I recognize that such programs may
                        seem marginal in terms of focusing our energies on those key sectors which
                        will contribute most to sustained economic growth. But I regard them as
                        justified on a different though related basis, i.e., that of contributing to
                        internal security and resisting Communist-supported insurgency.</p>
                    <p>I am further aware that police programs, as a relatively minor facet of the
                        functions of the aid agency, may have tended to receive little emphasis as a
                        result. Therefore, I would like you to consider various ways and means of
                        giving the police program greater autonomy within <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                            >AID</gloss>, if this seems necessary in order to protect it from
                        neglect.</p>
                    <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0282"/>
                    <p>I fully recognize that police programs must be looked at on a case-by-case
                        basis and that in some instances they can indeed be cut back or eliminated.
                        I simply wish to insure that before doing so we have taken fully into
                        account the importance of the counter-insurgency objective as I view it.</p>
                    <p>In sum, I should like <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> to review carefully
                        its role in the support of local police forces for internal security and
                        counter-insurgency purposes, and to recommend to me through the Special
                        Group (Counter-Insurgency) what new or renewed emphases are desirable.<note

                        following lines.</p>
                    <p>I started off by saying that according to the Saturday Evening Post, <gloss
                            target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> was supposed to be the Devil's Advocate, so
                        I was about to advocate some deviltry.</p>
                    <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0283"/>
                    <p>I began by saying that the basic concept here reminded me very much of our
                        discussions in the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research concerning
                        the Free World System, and saying that I had been Paul Nitze's principal
                        collaborator in that but that some reservations ought to be made.</p>
                    <p>I said that we don't have as great leverage to create a community of
                            values<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">The drafts of February 14 and March 26
                            spoke in similar terms of the importance of the United States
                            encouraging the emergence of a free world community sharing common
                            democratic political values. See <ref target="#d70">Document
                            70</ref>.</note> as the paper suggests nor does a failure to do this
                        give the Communists as much of an opportunity as the paper suggests.</p>
                    <p>In the foreseeable future the lesser developed countries are not susceptible
                        to such organization by either side.</p>
                    <p>In Latin America, the United States has a great opportunity but not so in
                        Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>In these areas the notion of an order sponsored by the West is either
                        irrelevant or suspect. It is irrelevant because these nations are largely
                        preoccupied with creating a viable national order of their own. It is
                        suspect because one of the goals of these nations is precisely to
                        disentangle themselves from the old colonial order.</p>
                    <p>The assertion that governments by consent and respect for individual liberty
                        will play a larger role in these countries seems to us to be questionable.
                        In fact, it might be the reverse. The problem in the lesser developed
                        countries is precisely to accumulate power at the center. They must develop
                        a capacity to assemble information and skills at the center; to develop a
                        capacity to reach decisions about a society as a whole at the center; and to
                        develop a capacity to carry out those decisions effectively.</p>
                    <p>This first priority task of developing power, authority, and skills at the
                        center, is not always consistent with at least the forms of western
                        parliamentary democracy; if all the above is so, then in these parts of the
                        world our goal may be less to assure an environment of sustained progress,
                        higher standards of wealth, social justice and so on, and more so to play
                        the game that the Communists are not permitted to swing the balance in their
                        favor.</p>
                    <p>We do not suggest that we should repudiate the effort to create a world order
                        based on a community of value. It is a question of appropriate emphasis.</p>
                    <p>If our prior objective is to create a community of values, we are bound to
                        suffer disillusionment. If we are careless about how we talk about it, we
                        will alienate many on ideological grounds. If we emphasize too much using
                        our resources in helping those who share our values, we will lose
                        flexibility in offsetting Soviet advances.</p>
                    <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0284"/>
                    <p>The Secretary immediately challenged me by saying that he thought I should
                        examine this question empirically, that if I looked at the world country by
                        country, he was sure that I would find that most of the nations did in fact
                        share our basic values. He said that the charter of the United Nations was
                        really an expression of our national goals and of the national goals of all
                        countries. I argued that in a discussion in the Washington Center, I had
                        often taken the position that in countries like Ceylon, for example, it was
                        interesting to see that although the elites there frequently criticized the
                        United States, when it came to a choice, they generally acted for western
                        values. My point was one of emphasis.</p>
                    <p>To my amazement, my major support came from Harlan Cleveland,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d73fn4">Assistant Secretary of State for International
                            Organization Affairs.</note> who said that he thought <gloss
                            target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> had a good point here and that there were
                        other ways of expressing consent than the forms of parliamentary democracy.
                        This made a little headway with the Secretary who made a distinction between
                        a dictatorship and a monopoly of political power at the top, citing Pakistan
                        where Ayub<note n="5" xml:id="d73fn5">Field Marshal Mohammed Ayub Khan,
                            President of Pakistan.</note> would certainly not be replaced by any
                        democratic process, but that if you walked around the streets of the towns
                        or cities in Pakistan, you do not have the impression of a dictatorship.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">George McGhee</persName> challenged my point,
                        however, which gave me a good opportunity, because after talking about how
                        dependent he was on coffee plantation worker in Colombia for his coffee and
                        how the plantation worker was dependent upon George for drinking coffee, he
                        cited that he had worked hard to get Nitze's paper into the Draper
                            Report.<note n="6" xml:id="d73fn6">On November 24, 1958, President
                            Eisenhower appointed William H. Draper, Jr., to head the President's

                            1959, the Committee submitted to the President its Report on the
                            Organization and Administration of the Military Assistance Program
                            (Washington, 1959).</note></p>
                    <p>This gave me the opportunity to remind him that I was co-author of that piece
                        that he had worked so hard to get in and that I was not in a position of
                        saying that we should junk it, or, that is, junk the concept, that I was in
                        the same position that Max Millikan and others found themselves in after
                        they wrote the book about “A Proposal”<note n="7" xml:id="d73fn7">Max F.

                            1957). The book called for an expanded long-term program of U.S.
                            participation in the economic development of underdeveloped
                            areas.</note> and found themselves coming to Washington and making
                        speeches against their own book, because they had thought it had been
                        oversold. My point was not that we should not try to build in the direction
                        of a community of shared values but that we should not be oversold on the
                        possibilities of developing a community of shared values. In the process of
                        this, the Secretary suggested <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0285"/>that
                        we in <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> might sponsor a study with

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName></hi>: I
                        have gone over with interest your paper on Basic National Security
                            Policy<note n="1" xml:id="d75fn1">Reference is to the March 26 draft of
                            “Basic National Security Policy;” see <ref target="#d70">Document
                                70</ref>.</note> and take the liberty of submitting a few
                        comments.</p>
                    <p>The paper obviously covers a great deal of ground and with much of what is
                        said I am in entire agreement. What troubles me about it is primarily a
                        matter of emphasis and balance, not so much what is said as what is not
                        said.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me (1) that the paper concentrates almost entirely on the contest
                        with Communism and how to win it, and (2) that, even within that restricted
                        framework, disproportionate emphasis is laid on the military factor.
                        Certainly no one would deny that the successful conduct of the struggle with
                        Communism is central to the maintenance of our national security and
                        national purposes, or that a very strong military deterrent together with
                        other military, including counterguerilla, capabilities are vital components
                        of a successful national strategy.<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">Next to this
                            sentence <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> wrote the
                            following marginal note: “I don't, but I can see how he would.”</note>
                        My concern <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0290"/>is that certain other
                        equally important elements are passed over very cursorily, leaving the
                        impression that their place in our national strategy is relatively
                        inconsequential.</p>
                    <p>I have felt, long before taking on my present job, that the multilateral
                        framework existing in the United Nations and its related agencies created
                        for the United States both opportunities and duties which can contribute
                        substantially to the achievement of our national purposes. Even if one
                        narrows his interest to the struggle against Communism, certainly the
                        eventual orientation of the Afro-Asians and Latin-Americans is a factor
                        which in a hot war could be most significant, in a prolonged cold war
                        competition could be decisive.</p>
                    <p>Our two chief instruments for influencing these nations are (1) economic and
                        military aid and (2) our policies and tactics in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> and its subsidiaries. Of course there are many other of our
                        national purposes and national interests which are closely involved in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and which have little or nothing to do
                        with our struggle against Communism. Yet the original draft of the Security
                        Policy paper<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">Apparent reference to the February
                            24 draft, the first of the <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>
                            drafts to be widely circulated.</note> touched on the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> only in the most sketchy fashion and, while
                        the re-draft is an improvement, it still falls decidedly short of what I
                        would consider adequate to balance other elements in the paper. I therefore
                        strongly urge that this section be again reviewed with <gloss
                            target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> and substantially more of the material
                        supplied to <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_IO1"
                            >IO</gloss> be incorporated. We have submitted detailed comments to
                            <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>Another most significant area in which it seems to me the paper is seriously
                        out of balance is in the relative emphasis it places, on the one hand, on
                        the development of military and political means of combating the Communist
                        threat and, on the other, the development of equally essential means of
                        controlling nuclear weapons systems which, as they are refined, magnified
                        and proliferated, tend to become an even more critical threat to our
                        national security and our national purposes. True, the latter subject is
                        dealt with in the paper but it seems to be largely subordinated to the other
                        aim in a fashion which makes me doubt whether, if the directives of the
                        paper were scrupulously followed, we should ever escape from the
                        self-defeating, even though temporarily necessary, escalation in which we
                        are now engaged.</p>
                    <p>To be more specific, in the basic section entitled “The Setting”, pp 3-5,
                        there is only the most tangential and cloudy reference to the fact that an
                        essential element of the setting is that at present our national security
                        could be largely nullified and most of our national purposes frustrated in
                            <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0291"/>a matter of days or hours,
                        simply by accident or miscalculation. (In this connection I would contest
                        most strenuously the assertion (p. 78) that “The possibilities of a nuclear
                        war coming about by accident or miscalculation are statistically real if, on
                        the whole, unlikely.”)</p>
                    <p>Proceeding from this incomplete account of the setting, the paper immediately
                        moves on to “The Clash” and “The Threat” which concentrate almost
                        exclusively on dealing with the Communist threat. The paper then proceeds to
                        an “Outline of Strategy” in which Military Policy is given a probably
                        unavoidable priority but in which that policy is described in terms of “a
                        stable military environment”, than which no imaginable conception could
                        under present circumstances be in my opinion more unrealistic or more
                        dangerously misleading. Is it in fact possible to recall any time in history
                        when the military environment has been less stable or more perilous to
                        humanity and to civilization?</p>
                    <p>Later in this 285 page document “Arms Control” is briefly treated pp. 76-84.
                        In the section on “Relations with Communist Nations” there are three
                        paragraphs pp. 176-178 on “The possibility of a detente” and “Negotiation”,
                        but these two subjects are treated very gingerly as though both detente and
                        negotiation were instruments more likely to profit totalitarian than
                        democratic states, an assumption for which I see no justification.</p>
                    <p>Let me reiterate in conclusion that with much of the paper I am in
                        enthusiastic agreement. The extensive attention given throughout to
                        “building a community of free nations”, which involves both strengthening
                        our ties with Western Europe, and contributing to the economic and political
                        development of Latin America, Asia and Africa, is certainly admirable. So
                        are many of the proposals, military and non-military, for dealing more
                        effectively with the Communist threat.</p>
                    <p>But I remain deeply troubled by what seems to me the dangerous underemphasis
                        on the threat of uncontrolled nuclear weapons systems to our national
                        security, and on the failure to recognize and utilize adequately
                        multilateral instrumentalities for the pursuit of our national goals.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            the evident military capability to defeat the forces being deterred.
                            While many other variable factors contribute to effective deterrence,
                            this requirement to defeat the enemy is constant and must be

                            emphasis throughout the section that divisive factors in the Communist

                            impulses for human freedom move toward “a reduction in thrust toward the
                            external world…” While these forces tend in this direction, insufficient
                            emphasis is placed upon the still existing strong Police State

                                towards them. The understandable difficulties within a pluralistic

                                to project a positive image of U.S. intentions, as developed in this

                            meeting of the Planning Group, no record of which has been found. In a

                            dated April 23, Bundy reiterated the points he made in this memorandum
                            and then made a detailed critique of the paper. At many points he
                            objected to terms such as “national strategy,” “hard core,” and
                            “ideology.” He called for separation of Parts Three and Four from the
                            draft paper and a drastic reduction in the number of planning tasks.

                    <p>I myself question whether, when we come to action, we shall want to approve
                        as national policy a document anything like as long or as fully argued as
                        this one. I doubt very much if we can achieve consensus or clear
                        Presidential approval on anything as comprehensive as this, and I also think
                        that, to secure effective attention to the things we really do care about,
                        we need to put them more sharply and briefly. This pudding has most of the
                        plums, but I think they should be pulled out and made more feasible.</p>
                    <p>I have a grave reservation about the notions implied by the words “doctrine”
                        and “strategy” in connection with basic policy. They imply that our
                        attitudes are “doctrinaire” and our activities all bound by some single
                        “strategic” concept. I think neither proposition is correct, and I much
                        prefer the simple and traditional word “policy.” I do not think this is just
                        a terminological difference.</p>
                    <p>The paper seems to me to imply a kind of equal and adequate effort
                        everywhere, and I think both abroad and at home we have to have a clear
                        sense of limits, and of priorities.</p>
                    <p>Having said all this, I regard the paper as much the most important forward
                        move that has taken place in the area of framing basic policy positions
                        since we came in, and for its military passages alone it seems to me to

                    <p>The draft <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> is a commendable effort to
                        describe a coherent national security policy. It goes far toward meeting the
                        frequently expressed need for a “grand design” to which diverse activities
                        and day-to-day designs of government can be related. The key concepts in
                        this design appear to be four: <list>

                        <item>The world as viewed in this document divides neatly into two parts—a
                            free world and a Communist world. Although the ambiguous position of a
                            nation like Yugoslavia is recognized in detail, such details are not
                            reflected in the grand scheme. The free world is defined by exclusion as
                            simply the whole world minus the Communist bloc, and is referred to
                            either as the free community or as the evolving free community of
                            nations. In this context our security policy rests on two simple
                            propositions. First, we should guard the boundaries of the free world,
                            i.e., prevent any movement of nations from the free world to the Bloc
                            (pp 8-11, 14-16). Second, this is a feasible task. We can always succeed
                            in preventing any undesirable change by the proper combination of the
                            threat of military force, the application of military force, including
                            counter-subversive and counter-guerrilla force, and the provision of
                            economic aid. The use of other instruments of diplomacy is also
                            recognized, but given a lesser place (pp 22-31).</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item><p>These axioms imply two further propositions. First, Communism is an
                                aberration on the path of political-economic development. No nation
                                becomes Communist mainly because the Communist forces within it form
                                the best organized, most aggressive, most able political group whose
                                appeal to rising political elites—university students, army
                                officers, would-be prophets of national development—is strong enough
                                to carry the day. Not only did Marx not proclaim the universal
                                truth; he proclaimed the universal myth, false in all instances. It
                                is Communist subversion and indirect aggressions, Soviet or Chinese
                                led, not social revolution internally generated, that is the
                                cause.</p>
                            <p>That the present balance of membership between the free community of
                                nations and the Communist bloc is the optimum balance is the second
                                major corollary of the two fundamental propositions. Indeed if the
                                world does divide neatly into two parts and the smaller part is
                                trying to expand at the expense of the larger, there is something
                                obvious about the proposition that it is in the interests of the
                                larger part to resist such a <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0301"
                                />shift. Even at this level of analysis, however, obvious does not
                                equal correct. If, for example, we were to observe that the costs of
                                our resisting expansion are related to the strength of the expansive
                                impulse on the other side and, further, if we suspected that the
                                strength of the expansive impulses might obey the familiar dynamic
                                law of proportionality to the difference between the present
                                situation and the pre-set goal (e.g., world domination), then we can
                                see a simple counter-example to the truth of the obvious
                                proposition.</p></item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item><p>There is an alternative view of the world which appears more useful
                                for the purposes of defining national policy. From our own
                                perspective, the world is divided into at least three, rather than
                                two, parts, the boundary lines of which are by no means well-defined
                                or firm. One part consists of the U.S. and the nations most closely
                                associated with it in terms of fundamental security interests: the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance. Another group
                                consists of the Sino-Soviet bloc. Other nations have attachments to
                                these two groups of different degrees of permanence and strength.
                                The essential problem of our security policy is at the minimum to
                                prevent a significant shift in the balance of power between the two
                                polar groups and, to the extent consistent with other constraints on
                                our policy, to increase the unity, power and influence of our own
                                group at the expense of the Bloc. The constraints which operate to
                                limit the means available and appropriate to this purpose fall
                                broadly into two classes: those arising from our nature as an
                                individualistic, voluntaristic, democratic society and those arising
                                from the limitations of our own power and that of the group of
                                nations with whom we are most intimately bound. An important part of
                                the limitations of our own power arises from the fact that, while
                                the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations have goals
                                closely similar to ours, they are not in fact identical, and we deal
                                with them by consensus rather than direction. Although, logically,
                                it falls into the first category of constraints on our policy, the
                                awful character of thermonuclear war deserves mention as a separate
                                constraint. Its consequences for the character and possibly the
                                survival of our civil society are such that it becomes an instrument
                                of policy whose uses are sharply limited.</p>
                            <p>From the polar Soviet perspective the world looks much the same, and
                                our problem is to some extent the converse of theirs. We say “to
                                some extent” because the role of an ideological doctrine in the
                                Soviet world perspective has no parallel in our own world view. The
                                doctrine of freedom in individual and national choice is not one
                                that readily fills a parallel role to the doctrine of universal
                                class struggle ending in the ultimate triumph of communism.</p>
                            <p>The draft <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> cogently states the
                                significance of the revolution of modernization which is sweeping
                                the under-developed two-thirds of the world as the environment in
                                which the contest between ourselves and the Bloc is taking place. It
                                also properly states our hopes in respect to this struggle. However,
                                we must interpose a calculus of cost between our <pb n="270"
                                    xml:id="pg_270" facs="0302"/>hopes and our goals, and it is in
                                this calculus of cost that the draft is deficient.</p></item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>It is clear that an entirely different order of priority attaches to
                            maintaining the integrity and unity of the inner group of nations with
                            which we are closely allied. This high priority is reflected both in the
                            major significance that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has in our
                            military policy and in the framework of organizational arrangements for
                            economic and political cooperation within the North Atlantic community.
                            Our military commitments to defend at least these areas is on a par with
                            our military commitment to the defense of the United States itself. This
                            commitment is central to the intimacy of political and economic
                            relations within the area. It is an important question as to how far we
                            extend this framework to include Australia, New Zealand and Japan. One
                            question that arises in this connection, is the extent to which China
                            will grow to possess military power that threatens these nations to the
                            same extent that Soviet military power threatens Western Europe.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item><p>For the other parts of the world, our commitments are hard to state
                                in general a priori terms. In general, we do, as the draft states,
                                wish to help nations on the path to modernization and
                                self-realization, with a political orientation at least neutral as
                                between ourselves and the Bloc, other things being equal. And by the
                                same token, other things being equal, we wish to prevent, if we can,
                                any nation from joining the Bloc, or orienting itself strongly to
                                it. But it is difficult to say something less general and abstract.
                                In a given situation, we must evaluate all factors to decide what
                                kind of extension of Bloc influence or power raises what kind of
                                questions for us of countering it on the one hand; and on the other,
                                what means to attempt to counter it are available at what costs and
                                with what prospects of success. In general, it would appear safe to
                                say that in most cases we would resist direct expansion of Bloc
                                power by overt military means, but even here it is difficult to make
                                strong over-all commitments. If the Chinese Communists infiltrate
                                Burma, and follow this infiltration by an overt march across the
                                borders of Burma, which the Burmese do not resist, are we prepared
                                in fact to respond? If not, can we successfully communicate to the
                                Chinese Communists the sense that we are? If after five more years
                                of growth of Soviet influence in the Afghan Army, that Army revolts,
                                overthrows the present regime and invites the assistance of the
                                Soviets in their revolt, how should we be prepared to respond?</p>
                            <p>At all those lesser levels of violence covered by the phrase
                                “indirect aggression and subversion,” the difficulty of stating any
                                general policy line is even greater. A primary instrument—perhaps
                                even in fact a necessary condition—in successful resistance to

                        <item>The conclusion to be drawn with respect to our policy in the large
                            part of the world outside our own central group and the Soviet Bloc is
                            that we proceed here on a case-by-case method. To be sure we start with
                            some sense of relevant priorities, some calculus of costs and returns.
                            It is obviously of far greater importance to our own policy goals to
                            keep India on its present somewhat western-oriented neutral path than it
                            is to keep Burma from being infiltrated by Chinese Communists, and we
                            should behave accordingly. In Latin America, it is far more important to
                            try to keep Argentina and Brazil economically progressing and
                            politically stable than it is to prevent Georgetown from becoming a
                            quasi-Communist capital.</item>

                        <item><p>The perspective here sketched has obvious implications for both aid
                                policy and military policy. While it remains true that there are
                                reasons for giving aid not intimately connected with the orientation
                                of a nation in the contest between ourselves and the Bloc, it also
                                remains true that we cannot ignore this contest in determining aid
                                priorities. The whole argument for giving Latin America a special
                                priority is a political one, not one based on development
                                criteria.</p>
                            <p>What we are prepared to defend by military means, and what we state
                                or suggest we are prepared to defend, is still the key element in
                                the application of our power. Ultimately it is these commitments,
                                explicit and implicit, which form the framework of our foreign
                                policy, since they give substantive content to the term “vital
                                interest” used in a literal sense. Therefore, the difference in
                                perspective suggested here makes an important difference in the way
                                we view our military responsibilities and accordingly in the way we
                                determine our military needs.</p></item>

                    <p>I feel that the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> should contain a clear
                        statement of policy with regard to the dual capability desired in our Armed
                        Forces. This refers, of course, to their ability for sustained combat,
                        either with or without the use of atomic weapons. Several years ago the Army
                        made this dual capability its objective and has developed its forces with
                        reasonable consistency to this principle. The Air Force, and to a lesser
                        degree the Navy, went the other way, assuming that atomic weapons would
                        henceforth be used with little limitation. For them to change completely now
                        would be a very expensive operation, and with respect to strategic weapons,
                        undesirable—all the more reason for giving specific guidance.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">b. The Role of Tactical Atomic
                            Weapons</hi></p>
                    <p>To my knowledge there has never been a comprehensive statement of national
                        policy on the role of tactical atomic weapons in the Armed Forces. Such
                        statements as have been made on this subject have been confused by failure
                        to define what are tactical atomic weapons. In the course of time, this term
                        has come to mean those weapons employed by the Army or delivered by tactical
                        aircraft. Thus, they vary in yield from the very small Army Davy Crockett to
                        the megaton weapons transportable in tactical aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, there is little in common either as to use or effects of weapons
                        of such differing characteristics. In my view, we should divide this
                        category into two parts: One, those for short-range battlefield employment
                        varying in yield from a few tons of TNT to a few <gloss target="#t_KT1"
                            >KT</gloss>; the second, the interdiction weapons which would include
                        the higher yields among the present tactical weapons. The interdiction
                        weapons would be used to keep hostile ground forces from the battlefield.
                        The small atomic weapons would be used to destroy the enemy at relatively
                        close range with discrimination and without significant fallout hazard to
                        our own troops or friendly populations. Something like this needs to be said
                        in the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss>.</p>

                            >BNSP</gloss> recognizes specifically the need to modernize <gloss

                        recent visit to Europe with the interest, particularly of the Germans, in
                        our modernization policy. They will never be content to be told that the
                        weapons on the continent will gradually disappear to be replaced by better
                        ones over the horizon, perhaps, in the United States. It is perfectly clear
                        that the so-called external nuclear forces have no application to the
                        battlefield requirements which can be met only by the small atomic weapons
                        mentioned in the preceding paragraph. To Germans concerned with the safety
                        of Hamburg and Munich, it is no reassurance to know that <gloss

                    <p>Is it impossible for the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> to give some
                        guidance as to the size of an aggression which we should be able to meet
                        without resort to atomic weapons? I understand the difficulty of expressing
                        dimensions, but am often impressed with the difference in time apparently
                        present in the minds of people discussing the “pause” to be imposed by
                        conventional weapons. To some in General <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1"
                            >Norstad</persName>'s headquarters, this seems to mean a very short
                        time, or perhaps no time at all after contact with the enemy has been made.
                        Elsewhere one talks in term of days, or perhaps weeks. Between these
                        extremes, there is a very wide range of requirements in friendly forces to
                        impose the pause. It would be interesting to war game a <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact conflict to determine the
                        difference in forces required to hold one day against a full onslaught
                        versus the forces needed to hold for eight days.</p>

                        is true, will they be willing to wait five or six years to get it? I would
                        think that if we are sincere in supporting this later force, we would be

                        the employment of existing weapons. I find nothing in the <gloss

                    <p>On April 25, 1962, the U.S. Intelligence Board circulated <gloss
                            target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 13-2-62, “Chinese Communist Advanced
                        Weapons Capabilities.” The Estimate acknowledged important gaps in available
                        information and therefore did not attempt to predict the year in which
                        deployment of a complete weapons system would probably begin. Regarding a
                        Chinese nuclear test, the Estimate concluded: “Assuming an accelerated and
                        highly successful program for the production of plutonium since 1960, the
                        Chinese Communists could detonate an all-plutonium device in early 1963.
                        However, in the light of all the evidence, it is unlikely that the Chinese
                        will meet such a schedule. We believe that the first Chinese test would
                        probably be delayed beyond 1963, perhaps by as much as several years.” The
                        Air Force dissented, believing that a plutonium explosion was “likely” by
                        1963 and that if this occurred, it would be within Chinese capabilities to
                        test a thermonuclear device “by the end of the decade.” The Navy, on the
                        other hand, believed there was insufficient evidence to make any “reliable
                        estimate of the Chinese Communist program in the development of nuclear
                        weapons.”</p>
                    <p>The Estimate also concluded that a nuclear weapons program had been underway
                        in China since the early 1950s, and a guided missile program since the late
                        1950s; that the Chinese program had received substantial Soviet assistance
                        until about mid-1960; that any attempt to mass-produce advanced weapons
                        would be difficult for China; that China would need 2 or more years after
                        its first nuclear test to develop fission weapons for nuclear warheads, and
                        that it would probably not undertake to develop surface-to-air missiles
                        until at least the mid-1960s; that “within the next few years, the Chinese

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. General Nuclear War and Its
                            Deterrence</hi></p>
                    <p>Nuclear technology has revolutionized warfare over the past seventeen years.
                        The unprecedented destructiveness of these arms has radically changed ways
                        of thinking about conflict among nations. It has properly focused great
                        attention and efforts by the Alliance on the prevention of conflict.
                        Nevertheless, the U.S. has come to the conclusion that to the extent
                        feasible basic military strategy in general nuclear war should be approached
                        in much the same way that more conventional military operations have been
                        regarded in the past. That is to say, our principal military objectives, in
                        the event of a nuclear war stemming from a major attack on the Alliance,
                        should be the destruction of the enemy's military forces while attempting to
                        preserve the fabric as well as the integrity of allied society.
                        Specifically, our studies indicate that a strategy which targets nuclear
                        forces only against cities or a mixture of civil and military targets has
                        serious limitations for the purpose of deterrence and for the conduct of
                        general nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>In our best judgment, destroying enemy forces while preserving our own
                        societies is—within the limits inherent in the great power of nuclear
                        weapons—a not wholly unattainable military objective. Even if very
                        substantial exchanges of nuclear weapons were to occur, the damage suffered
                        by the belligerents would vary over wide ranges, depending upon the targets
                        that are hit. If both sides were to confine their attacks to important
                        military targets, damage, while high, would nevertheless be significantly
                        lower than if urban-industrial areas were also attacked. As an example, our
                        studies of a hypothetical general nuclear war occurring in 1966 show that,
                        with the conflict starting under one particular set of circumstances, and
                        with the Soviets confining their attacks to military targets, the United
                        States under present civil defense plans might suffer 25 million deaths and
                        Europe might suffer somewhat fewer. On the other hand, were the Soviets to
                        attack urban-industrial as well as military targets, the United States might
                        incur 75 million deaths and Europe would have to face the prospect of losing
                        115 million people. While both sets of <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276"
                            facs="0308"/>figures make grim reading, the first set is preferable to
                        the second. There are others like them.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these findings the United States has developed its plans in
                        order to permit a variety of strategic choices. We have also instituted a
                        number of programs which will enable the Alliance to engage in a controlled
                        and flexible nuclear response in the event that deterrence should fail.
                        Whether the Soviet Union will do likewise must remain uncertain. All we can
                        say is that the Kremlin has very strong incentives—in large part provided by
                        the nuclear strength of the Alliance—to adopt similar strategies and
                        programs. Thus, we calculate that in 1966, if the Alliance were to limit its
                        retaliatory attack to miltary targets in the Soviet Union, while holding
                        superior forces in reserve, the Soviets might suffer around 25 million
                        deaths, whereas if we attack urban-industrial targets in the wake of a
                        Soviet strike against European and American cities, the Soviets would suffer
                        at least 100 million deaths.</p>
                    <p>Other factors besides target strategies of the belligerents would determine
                        the damage in a thermo-nuclear war. The yields of the warheads used in a
                        nuclear exchange would make a significant difference in the amount of blast,
                        thermal, and fallout damage; and it is possible to match the yields to the
                        particular targets under attack and so reduce damage to civilians.
                        Furthermore, as the accuracy of missiles improves, the belligerents could
                        attack targets with greater assurance of destroying them; they could also
                        reduce the yields with which they strike. If they so choose, they could
                        regulate the height at which they burst their weapons and thereby affect the
                        amount of fallout that is distributed. The existence of civil defenses also
                        could have a significant impact on the number of deaths, especially if only
                        military targets are attacked so that the principal danger to most civilians
                        is from fallout. Depending on these and other factors, the number of deaths
                        could vary over a wide range—by four times or more. The more discriminating
                        the attacks, the less the damage.</p>
                    <p>I have raised these points because we think they are relevant to allied
                        defense policies now and in the future. In particular, we believe that they
                        have important implications for the general war posture of the Alliance and
                        the role that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should assign to nuclear
                        forces in its grand strategy.</p>

                            Alliance</hi></p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most important implication of these observations is that nuclear
                        superiority has important meanings. I want to stress that for the most
                        relevant planning period—through the mid 1960's—there can be little question
                        about the ability of the Alliance to maintain nuclear superiority over the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc. During the coming fiscal year the <pb n="277"
                            xml:id="pg_277" facs="0309"/>United States plans to spend close to $15
                        billion on its nuclear weapons to assure such superiority.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a description of the U.S. strategic retaliatory arsenal, target
                        coverage of the threat to Europe, survivability and control, and
                        indivisibility of control.]</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. The Role of General War Strength in
                            Alliance Strategy</hi></p>
                    <p>What does the Alliance accomplish by creating this complex machinery to
                        maintain nuclear superiority over the Sino-Soviet Bloc? And what is the
                        impact on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s policies of both the grave
                        damage that would result from nuclear war and the great variations in that
                        damage under different strategies?</p>
                    <p>My Government feels that the strategic capabilities I have described have
                        important political consequences. The Alliance continues to possess much of
                        the diplomatic freedom that it has enjoyed in the past. We can confidently
                        reject the missile threats that Mr. <persName>Krushchev</persName> so
                        imprudently brandishes. If the Soviets or their satellites impinge on our
                        interests we can resist with considerable confidence that our antagonists
                        will not wish to escalate the conflict. The question at issue now is the
                        point at which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, not the Soviets, would
                        wish to escalate a non-nuclear conflict.</p>
                    <p>As the President has indicated on a number of occasions, the United States is
                        prepared to respond immediately with nuclear weapons to the use of nuclear
                        weapons against one or more members of the Alliance. The United States is
                        also prepared to counter with nuclear weapons any Soviet conventional attack
                        so strong that it cannot be dealt with by conventional means. But let us be
                        quite clear what we are saying and what we have to face. Owing to our
                        non-nuclear deficiencies, there is, first, a high probability that in an
                        ambiguous situation the West, not the East, would have to make the decision
                        to initiate the use of nuclear weapons. Secondly, there is the almost
                        certain prospect that, despite our nuclear superiority and our ability to
                        destroy the Soviet target system, all of us will suffer deeply in the event
                        of major nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>The Berlin crisis exemplifies a type of threat that we should expect to face
                        elsewhere in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area. In such a
                        crisis the provocation, while severe, does not immediately require or
                        justify our most violent reaction. Also as such a crisis develops, as
                        military force is threatened or becomes engaged—even in limited
                        quantities—the increasingly alert nuclear posture of the belligerents makes
                        the prospective outcome of a nuclear attack for both sides even less
                        attractive.</p>
                    <p>In short, faced with the more likely contingencies, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, not the Soviets, would have to make the momentous
                        decision to use nuclear weapons, and we would do so in the knowledge that
                        the consequences might be catastrophic for all of us.</p>
                    <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0310"/>
                    <p>We in the United States are prepared to accept our share of this
                        responsibility. And we believe that the combination of our nuclear
                        superiority and a strategy of controlled response gives us some hope of
                        minimizing damage in the event that we have to fulfill our pledge. But I
                        would be less than candid if I pretended to you that the United States
                        regards this as a desirable prospect or believes that the Alliance should
                        depend solely on our nuclear power to deter the Soviet Union from actions
                        not involving a massive commitment of Soviet force. Surely an Alliance with
                        the wealth, talent, and expression that we possess can find a better way
                        than this to meet our common threat.</p>
                    <p>We shall continue to maintain powerful nuclear forces for the Alliance as a
                        whole. They will continue to provide the Alliance a strong sanction against
                        Soviet first use of nuclear weapons. Under some circumstances they may be
                        the only instrument with which we can counter Soviet non-nuclear aggression,
                        in which case we should use them. But, in our view, the threat of general
                        war should constitute only one of the several weapons in our arsenal and one
                        to be used with prudence. On this question I can see no valid reason for a
                        fundamental difference of view on the two sides of the Atlantic.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">IV. Tactical Use of Nuclear
                        Weapons</hi></p>
                    <p>Our great nuclear superiority for general war does not solve all our problems
                        of deterring and dealing with less than all-out direct assault. What, then,
                        is the prospect that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> can fall back on
                        the local or tactical use of nuclear weapons? Battlefield nuclear weapons
                        were introduced in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at a time when our
                        Shield forces were weak and the Soviet atomic stockpile was small. In these
                        circumstances it was reasonable to hope that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> might very quickly halt a Soviet advance into Western
                        Europe by unilateral application of nuclear weapons on or near the
                        battlefield. Using nuclear weapons tactically might still accomplish a
                        desired end in the early 1960's. Consequently, we continue to maintain
                        substantial nuclear forces within the European theater and we now have over
                        [omission in the source text] nuclear weapons of various yields stockpiled
                        in Europe.</p>
                    <p>But how much dependence should <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> place on
                        these capabilities? We should succeed in deterring the Soviets from
                        initiating the use of nuclear weapons, and the presence of these weapons in
                        Europe helps to prevent Soviet use locally. But <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> can no longer expect to avoid nuclear retaliation in the
                        event that it initiates their use. Even a local nuclear exchange could have
                        consequences for Europe that are most painful to contemplate. Further, such
                        an exchange would be unlikely to give us any marked military advantage. It
                        could rapidly lead to general nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>To be sure, a very limited use of nuclear weapons, primarily for purposes of
                        demonstrating our will and intent to employ such weapons, <pb n="279"
                            xml:id="pg_279" facs="0311"/>might bring Soviet aggression to a halt
                        without substantial retaliation, and without escalation. This is a
                        next-to-last option we cannot dismiss. But prospects for success are not
                        high, and I hesitate to predict what the political consequences would be of
                        taking such action. It is also conceivable that the limited tactical use of
                        nuclear weapons on the battlefield would not broaden a conventional
                        engagement or radically transform it. But we do not rate these prospects
                        very highly.</p>
                    <p>Highly dispersed nuclear weapons in the hands of troops would be difficult to
                        control centrally. Accidents and unauthorized acts could well occur on both
                        sides. Furthermore, the pressures on the Soviets to respond in kind, the
                        great flexibility of nuclear systems, the enormous firepower contained in a
                        single weapon, the ease and accuracy with which that firepower can be called
                        in from unattacked and hence undamaged distant bases, the crucial importance
                        of air superiority in nuclear operations—all these considerations suggest to
                        us that local nuclear war would be a transient but highly destructive
                        phenomenon.</p>
                    <p>I realize there is a school of thought which believes that the United States
                        and the Soviet Union might seek to use Europe as a nuclear battleground and
                        thus avoid attacks on one another's homelands. Not only does my government
                        emphatically reject such a view; we also regard it as unrealistic. It
                        ignores the basic facts of nuclear warfare I have described; it contemplates
                        geographical limits unrelated to the actualities of target locations, and of
                        the varied sources from which attacks would come. Any substantial nuclear
                        operation in Europe inevitably would involve both forces and targets in the
                        U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It is possible, as I have
                        mentioned, that a small, demonstrative use of nuclear weapons could be
                        contained locally, and possibly, distant nuclear operations in less vital
                        locations outside the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area, or at sea,
                        may be limitable. But there is likely to be no effective operational
                        boundary, or set of mutual restraints, which could restrict large-scale
                        nuclear war to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Europe and the
                        satellites. As we understand the dynamics of nuclear warfare, we believe
                        that a local nuclear engagement would do grave damage to Europe, be
                        militarily ineffective, and would probably expand very rapidly into general
                        nuclear war.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">V. Non-Nuclear Forces and
                        Deterrence</hi></p>
                    <p>With the Alliance possessing the strength and the strategy I have described,
                        it is most unlikely that the Soviet Union will launch a nuclear attack on
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. But there are other forms of
                        aggression, and in December I mentioned our concern that the threat of
                        general war might be adequate against many lesser Soviet actions, political
                        as well as military. Some such hostile actions we could thwart now; others
                        we might not. To deal with these others, how can we convincingly show that
                        aggression, if <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0312"/>continued, would
                        lead to a situation where the danger of nuclear war was very great indeed?
                        Let us assume two situations:</p>
                    <p>In the first, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> front is lightly
                        covered by our forces. In the event of deep penetration by Soviet
                        non-nuclear forces which our forces cannot prevent, the only military
                        options open to Alliance forces are immediate nuclear response or defeat.
                        This might be true even for a minor Soviet challenge.</p>
                    <p>In the second, we assume the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> front
                        firmly held under a concept of forward strategy. Ready and able to deal with
                        any Soviet non-nuclear attack less that all-out, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces guard positively from the frontier against any
                        quick strike or ambiguous aggression. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> front can be broken only by massive application of Soviet
                        power. In such a major fight, if Western forces were thrown back, Alliance
                        nuclear action would follow.</p>
                    <p>If you were on the other side, which situation would you consider more laden
                        with a real risk of nuclear war with all its consequences? Which would make
                        you more inclined to refrain from a series of actions designed, step by
                        step, to erode <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s interests? To us the
                        answer is clear.</p>
                    <p>In the first situation, it simply is not credible that <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, or anyone else, would respond to a given
                        small step—the first slice of salami—with immediate use of nuclear weapons.
                        Nor is it credible that a chain of small actions, no one of which is
                        catastrophic, would evoke a response of general nuclear war. We regard it as
                        much more evident that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would find it
                        politically possible to act in effective defense of its interests from the
                        second posture than from the first.</p>
                    <p>The development of recent events concerning Berlin may provide relevant
                        evidence of the utility of limited but decisive action. Although it would be
                        premature to announce the end of this crisis, and in any case we cannot be
                        certain of the influences that most affect Kremlin policy, it is not
                        unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> non-nuclear buildup
                        conveyed to the Soviets the right message about Berlin. When the Soviets
                        began menacing Berlin, they may have entertained doubts about Western
                        determination; clearly they were not deterred from their initial steps by
                        our previous nuclear threats. But the creation of greater new non-nuclear
                        strength has reinforced our overall deterrent, and the aggression has not
                        occurred. It was not simply the substantial increase in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> manpower and the addition of the
                        equivalent of four combat-ready divisions, 88 more ships and 19 more air
                        squadrons, but the meaning which their addition conveyed of our
                        determination that may have given the Soviets second thoughts.</p>
                    <p>For the kinds of conflicts we think most likely to arise in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area, non-nuclear capabilities appear to
                        be clearly the sort the Alliance would wish to use at the outset. The
                        purpose of our common effort is the defense of the populations and
                        territories of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. To achieve this, at
                        least initially, with non-nuclear means requires that our non-nuclear <pb
                            n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0313"/>defense begin where the populations
                        and territories begin. A truly forward deployment, along the lines General
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGLC1">Norstad</persName> has advocated, we
                        consider an urgent need of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>Let me make clear however that we do not believe that a forward defense must
                        be able to defeat in non-nuclear action every conceivable element of Soviet
                        strength that might be thrown against it. Our nuclear forces would rapidly
                        come into play if an all-out attack developed. We believe the Soviets can
                        hardly doubt that; hence, we think it quite improbable that a major attack
                        would develop out of a crisis.</p>

                    <p>On May 7, 1962, the Policy Planning Council circulated a revised draft of the
                        paper, “Basic National Security Policy.” On May 9, the Council circulated a
                        “short form” of the document, 66 pages long. In a covering memorandum to the
                        May 7 draft, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName> stated
                        his intention, after taking into account suggested changes, to prepare a
                        draft to be circulated by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                            >Rusk</persName> to the President and <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> members. “The President will then give instructions for the
                        further consideration of the document.” (All in Department of State, <gloss

                    <p>The revision of May 7, 166 pages in length, drops the two concluding sections
                        on national security planning tasks and the anticipation of crises which had
                        been included in the March 26 draft (see <ref target="#d70">Document
                            70</ref>). The remainder of the paper retains the same basic structure
                        while incorporating many changes.</p>
                    <p>Part One, formerly titled “Doctrine,” is renamed “Principles and Purposes.”
                        In numerous places in the text, “principles” is substituted for “doctrine.”
                        In an early section on the “Nature of the Communist Threat,” a statement
                        retained from the March 26 draft that nuclear war itself “is one threat to
                        the American interest” is followed by new language stating that “the safety
                        of the nation and the possibility of deterring Communist aggression require
                        that we be prepared to face nuclear war in defense of our vital interests,
                        and that this fact be universally understood.” Introductory material retains
                        emphasis on the creation of a “free world community,” but cautions that its
                        creation is “a task which will remain unfinished for a long time.”</p>
                    <p>In Part Two, “Strategy,” a new discussion of tactical nuclear weapons
                        identifies roles for them, such as deterring enemy initiation of tactical
                            <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0314"/>nuclear warfare, enhancement of
                        the overall deterrent, selective use in situations in which escalation would
                        be unlikely to result (“notably” at sea and in the air). In use of tactical
                        nuclears, account should be taken of the danger of escalation, ability to
                        “frustrate aggression” without their use, and the political and physical
                        effects of a “local nuclear exchange.” The draft continues the emphasis on
                        buildup of non-nuclear general purpose force capability, but introduces the
                        term “dual capability” to describe the capacities of general purpose forces.
                        It states that if “a conflict or priority arises in the training and
                        equipping of general purpose forces as between non-nuclear and nuclear
                        combat, the balance should be struck in such a way as to ensure that the
                        entire requirements of non-nuclear combat are met.”</p>
                    <p>The section on arms control and disarmament states that “the possibility that
                        a nuclear war might result from accident or, more likely, miscalculation or
                        failure of communication is large enough to be an important reason for
                        seeking remedial measures.”</p>
                    <p>In the section on the “Framework of Organization,” the term “Northern ‘Hard
                        Core'” is retained. The draft continues the call, in connection with overall
                        strengthening of the European community, for reduction in the special
                        relationship with the United Kingdom, but states that the change should be
                        “carefully developed and evolutionary, and should avoid the appearance of an
                        abrupt turnaround.” The revision retains the remarks regarding the
                        ineffectiveness of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1"
                            >ANZUS</gloss> and the need for encouragement of their members to engage
                        in wider regional relationships on non-defense matters, but speaks also of
                        “maintaining fully the Manila Pact [<gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                        >SEATO</gloss>]as the foundation for the U.S. commitment to Southeast Asia.”
                        The section on the United Nations places somewhat greater emphasis on its
                        utility for the achievement of U.S. objectives.</p>
                    <p>Under “Relations With Communist Regimes,” the draft omits in the section on
                        Eastern Europe the former language on playing “‘liberation' in a low key”
                        but is otherwise substantively similar to the March 26 draft. In the
                        paragraphs on China, the language from the March 26 draft on PRC “de facto
                        recognition of the independent existence of Taiwan” as a condition for
                        normalization of Sino-U.S. relations is dropped: “The specific kinds of
                        modification that we would require as the price of more normal relations
                        should be the subject of continuing planning study.” Regarding Quemoy and
                        Matsu, the draft states: “The removal of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                        forces and/or the disengagement of U.S. prestige from the offshore islands
                        remains an objective of U.S. policy.”</p>
                    <p>In the last section, “The Domestic Base,” the revision gives increased
                        prominence to a proposal for solving the balance-of-payments problem through
                        encouragement of gains in U.S. productivity.</p>

                        repeat them in detail here but would, however, like to emphasize several of
                        the points I tried to make.</p>
                    <p>For some years I have advocated larger conventional forces which would give
                        us some choice other than all-out retaliation or retreat when faced with
                        Communist aggression. Consequently, I am much pleased to note the added
                        emphasis accorded these forces in your paper. But what concerns me now is
                        that this emphasis may have gone too far.</p>
                    <p>My basic reason in the past for pressing for larger conventional forces has
                        been to give us flexibility of response to hostile acts of aggression. It
                        has always seemed to me that the aim of our military policy should be to
                        increase the available alternatives in the possible uses of military force
                        and thereby achieve a graduated series of possible responses. The
                        development and use of very low yield atomic weapons for battlefield use has
                        always seemed to me to offer the possibility of a very valuable intermediate
                        stage in any escalating series of responses. If I understand the language of
                        the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss>, it would reduce this possibility
                        to the point of eliminating it.</p>
                    <p>It is true that some people in government doubt that we have a rational
                        program for the development and employment of tactical nuclear weapons.
                        Indeed, I am one of them. In the past the emphasis has been too heavily on
                        high yield weapons that are tactical only in the sense that they are
                        delivered by tactical aircraft or Army-type missiles. That is why I have
                        suggested that we should talk not of “tactical” nuclear weapons, but of
                        battlefield nuclear weapons—very small in yield—and of interdiction nuclear
                        weapons. The ambiguity of the present situation has been called to the
                        attention of the President who has directed a thorough study of the question
                        by the Department of Defense.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">see <ref
                                target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note> Until that study is
                        complete, we should not adopt language in the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1"
                            >BNSP</gloss> which, in effect, would <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284"
                            facs="0316"/>anticipate, possibly incorrectly, the results of the study.
                        In dealing with this question, we must not forget that the Soviet forces
                        have these weapons—at least the big “tactical” weapons and propose to use
                        them when needed. I doubt that any responsible official in our government
                        would want to take a position on this subject which would, in effect, put
                        U.S. forces on the battlefield with weapons inferior to those of the
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>Another point in your latest revision is the implication that since our
                        problems of actively defending the United States against direct attack by
                        sophisticated weapons are becoming increasingly difficult, we should
                        carefully evaluate new programs to avoid putting too many of our resources
                        in weapons that add little or nothing to the defense of our country.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">Both drafts contain language stating that
                            attainment of active defense objectives “will present increasing
                            difficulty as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> develops more
                            sophisticated weapons systems; hence, the actual level of resources to
                            be devoted to this mission should be reconsidered frequently and
                            thoroughly.” In the March 26 draft, however, an additional sentence
                            reads: “The political and psychological consequences of Soviet
                            acquisition of a real or reputed AICBM system—prior to the U.S.—should
                            be the subject of study and forehanded offsetting action.”</note> Such
                        guidance does not seem to me to be one that will encourage development of an
                        effective active defense and probably should be modified. I am often
                        impressed with how important Soviet air defense measures are to our
                        war-planners while we seem to attribute little importance to our own.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I would like to mention that I believe the paragraph in your
                        previous draft on the conduct of general war, as modified by the Joint
                        Chiefs, should be included in the final version of this paper.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d84fn5">In the March 26 draft, a paragraph on general war states
                            that because of the difficulty of fixing in advance detailed plans for
                            conducting military operations, the targeting plans and command and
                            control system must be designed to enable Presidential or
                            Presidentially-designated civilian control during an attack. Pre-attack
                            planning should aim at identifying ways to reduce the strategic
                            offensive capabilities of the enemy, particularly counter-city attacks,
                            and “facilitating the conduct of negotiations designed” to end the war
                            on terms consistent with U.S. interests. This paragraph does not appear
                            in the May 7 draft. In the Appendix to <ref target="#d76">Document
                                76</ref>, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> expanded and
                            redefined the tasks in general war.</note> Given the total resources we
                        now have invested in our ability to meet this dreaded but, hopefully,
                        unlikely contingency, it would seem essential to provide the military
                        planners some fairly specific guidance on their operations during any such
                        event. Otherwise, planning may take place that does not support national
                        objectives as fully as could otherwise be the case were guidelines provided,
                        and our ability to exercise control over the course of events may diminish
                        drastically.</p>
                    <p>I would be pleased to talk over any of the above comments with you. Also, I
                        would appreciate being kept abreast of the course of this next revision <pb

                    <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName>:</p>
                    <p>I am sorry to have been so long in acknowledging your letter of March 30<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d85fn1">Not found.</note> and in responding to your
                        suggestion that I comment on the draft of the <gloss target="#t_SP1"
                            >S/P</gloss> paper on “Basic National Security Policy.”<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d85fn2">Reference is to the March 26 draft; see <ref
                                target="#d70">Document 70</ref>.</note> The present security
                        regulations, which make it impossible to take work home in the evenings and
                        difficult to get at materials for use in the office after hours, have
                        complicated the performance of this sort of work.</p>
                    <p>Let me say first that from the technical standpoint, and speaking as one who
                        once held your present responsibilities, I am full of admiration for this
                        paper. I know what the preparation of such a document involves. I cannot
                        recall seeing in the files of our Government a document of such scope
                        remotely so well prepared: so lucid, so comprehensive, so well-written, and
                        so well knitted together. I think you and your associates deserve warmest
                        congratulations.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I find it difficult to advance the sort of comment you
                        invite. When, a year ago last winter, I decided to accept the President's
                        invitation to return to Government, I did so in the awareness that my views
                        on many problems of our relationship to the outside world were hopelessly
                        remote from the concepts prevailing both in our public opinion and within
                        Government. I also recognized that I had been <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286"
                            facs="0318"/>largely unsuccessful in making my own positions understood
                        or in winning support for them both in and out of Government in the years
                        since World War II. The decision to return to Government in the capacity of
                        Ambassador to Yugoslavia marked a deeper decision to abandon this struggle
                        and to try to be useful in a practical way by working loyally within a
                        framework of concept I could not personally share. In this I was guided by
                        admiration and solicitude for the new president and by the recognition that,
                        finding myself in so tiny a minority, I was quite apt to be wrong even where
                        I could not myself perceive the error.</p>
                    <p>In my daily work here, it has not been hard to perform this act of
                        detachment. Your inquiry now challenges me, however, on a plane so personal
                        that there can be no escape into the official personality, and so broad that
                        there can be no avoiding the underlying issues of public philosophy. The
                        fact is that to take issue properly with your paper, I should have to write
                        one equally long; and this, in the circumstances, is out of the
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Let me therefore content myself with reminding you, first of some of the
                        broader elements of my disagreement with outlooks and policies reflected in
                        your paper. I shall try just to identify the issues, without arguing them.
                        Here are a few:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1.View of Soviet intentions.</hi></p>
                    <p>I have never been able to share the wide-spread view of Soviet intentions—a
                        view which made the Stalin and the <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> of the postwar era almost indistinguishable not
                        only from each other but also from the Hitler of the Thirties. I have never
                        believed that there was serious danger of an outright Soviet military attack
                        on western Europe in the recent postwar period—of an attack, that is, that
                        would not be associated with an advanced state of social and political
                        disintegration in the area and could not be portrayed as auxiliary to a
                        major internal social upheaval. I have thought it unlikely that such an
                        attack entered into Soviet aspirations and plans. This being the case, I
                        have never been able to agree with the almost universally held belief (first
                        authoritatively enunciated, I think, by Churchill at Fulton) that only our
                        atomic deterrent had restrained the Russians from launching such an
                            attack.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">Reference is to Winston Churchill's
                            address delivered in March 1946 at Westminster College in Fulton,
                            Missouri.</note> I have always placed more weight on internal economic
                        and social stability in this and other areas than on military defense. This
                        difference of interpretation has affected my attitude towards western policy
                        on a host of occasions, and continues to do so.</p>
                    <p>Your paper, to be sure, does not wholly embrace the purely military view of
                        Soviet intentions that prevailed in former years. It gives far <pb n="287"
                            xml:id="pg_287" facs="0319"/>greater recognition to prospects for
                        infiltration, guerrilla warfare, use of disaffected local minorities, etc.
                        In this respect, I welcome it as an important advance over earlier thinking.
                        But the old concept shines through in a number of places, as for example on
                        pp. 141-143.<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">These pages deal with alliances,

                    <p>It has been my belief that we should not settle for the indefinite communist
                        control of Eastern Europe but should seek to create conditions in Europe
                        which not only give maximum incentive for a gradual detachment of the
                        Eastern European countries from their present exclusive tie to Moscow, but
                        facilitate that detachment to maximum degree. For this reason I have
                        disfavored putting major emphasis on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        at the cost of the prospects for disengagement, and have felt that we should
                        devise our undertakings in Europe, as was done in the case of the Marshall
                        Plan, in such a way that they could attract and invite participation by the
                        European countries without raising clear-cut issues with respect to their
                        military and political ties with Moscow. With this in mind, I have
                        questioned the soundness of the concepts on which <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> has developed. I would have preferred to see in effect a
                        unilateral guarantee by the United States of the present <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> territory in Europe, rather than the
                        present network of mutual obligation—a guarantee reinforced by a special
                        relationship of military support by the United States for the Brussels Pact.
                        Above all, I have never favored the admission of Germany to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and the development of West Germany's
                        resources and territory as a major component of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        with the goal of German unification, and was bound to make impossible for an
                        indefinite period to come any withdrawal or even any real slackening of the
                        Russian hold on the satellite area. The intensive rearmament of Western
                        Germany meant, in other words, the affirmation and perpetuation of the
                        division of the continent. This error, as I see it, has been and continues
                        to be compounded by the rejection of the Rapacki concepts and by the
                        development of West German and other continental territory as a base for

                        that European integration is to be pursued in an area that includes the

                    <p>If you will glance at a Policy Planning Staff paper prepared, I believe, just
                        at the end of 1949 and probably bearing a date in the first weeks of 1950,
                        on the subject of European integration,<note n="6" xml:id="d85fn6">Reference

                        will see that this concept is diametrically opposed to the one I then
                        favored, and still favor. The view I put forward at that time opposed
                        pressing Britain into an association with the Continent. It favored the
                        pursuit of integration—i.e., the bridging of sovereignties—in two groupings:
                        the U.S., U.K., and Canada, on the one hand; the major continental
                        countries, on the other. It recognized that Britain could be made a part of
                        a continental grouping only at the cost of watering down the significance of
                        the latter and preventing it from assuming a form sufficiently advanced to
                        meet the requirements of the German problem. It has taken us a further
                        twelve years of trouble to demonstrate something of the correctness of that
                        prognostication; and we have not yet come to the end of that road.</p>
                    <p>The same <gloss target="#t_PPS1">PPS</gloss> paper also warned, as I recall
                        it, against any forms of economic association in Western Europe which would
                        not be open, and attractive, for adherence by the Eastern European
                        countries, and in such a way that adherence would not involve questions of
                        Soviet military and political prestige. Today we have, in the example of the
                        Common Market, precisely the situation against which I attempted to warn. It
                        is an arrangement closely connected with the political and military
                        institutions which have been evolved in Western Europe; and we ourselves are
                        the first to insist that the privilege of association with it be denied to
                        anyone not prepared to acknowlege this association as extending into the
                        political field. Meanwhile, as was also predicted in the <gloss
                            target="#t_PPS1">PPS</gloss> paper under reference, we have provoked a
                        major crisis in the relations between Britain and the Commonwealth, with the
                        dreadful possibility that Canada itself will lose its internal and external
                        stability, and that one of the deepest sources of our security in North
                        America will thus be jeopardized.</p>
                    <p>Here again, as you see, we have very fundamental differences, and ones which
                        involve the entire philosophy underlying your paper.</p>

                    <p>For many years, I have advocated a policy designed to free us from all
                        dependence on atomic weapons, as on other weapons of indiscriminate mass
                        destruction, with a view to putting us in a position to seek, at the
                        earliest possible moment and if necessary at the cost of some apparent risk,
                        an agreement with the Russians for the total abandonment of the cultivation,
                        maintenance, and use of this sort of weaponry. To this end, I <pb n="289"
                            xml:id="pg_289" facs="0321"/>have urged that we free ourselves as soon
                        as possible from the invidious principle of “first-use” of atomic weapons,
                        which I believe must lead inexorably to a nuclear catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>Your paper, while again marking a great progress over the concepts of earlier
                        years, retains the principle of “first-use” and contemplates a continued
                        U.S. dependence on atomic weaponry.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this, your paper reflects at many points (pp. 35 and 46, for
                        example) the view that there could be a war fought with atomic weapons which
                        would be less than wholly disastrous for us—that there could, in other
                        words, be some pieces worth picking up for those who survived, and that this
                        prospect ought to enter into our thinking and planning. I wholly disagree.
                        As a historian, I confidently submit that if the western world is subjected
                        for the third time in a century to a military holocaust even comparable in
                        severity to those of 1914-1918 and 1939-1945, we have had it. If it is a war
                        with atomic weapons, I do not wish to see the result; and I would rather see
                        my children dead than to have them experience it.</p>

                            to policy toward the underdeveloped countries.</hi></p>
                    <p>Your paper is deeply imbued with a relatively optimistic view of the sources
                        of human behavior. This permits you to see such things as national
                        independence, individual freedom, industrialization, high living standards,
                        social justice, and restraint in foreign policy as all fusing into one
                        harmonious whole. This view, I suspect, is drawn from the example of our own
                        society; and one could argue that such inference was not wholly unwarranted,
                        though here, too, I should have doubts. It is, in any case, a view which,
                        when applied to the great mass of humanity, I cannot share. The ability to
                        harmonize these various elements into the political life of a state is
                        something which, if it exists at all, seems to me to be peculiar to peoples
                        who have had their origins on or near the shores of the North Sea; and here
                        I must attribute it not to any inherent superiority but to the favorable
                        effects of climate and to a fortunate discipline of experience running back
                        over the centuries. This being the case, I cannot expect this example to be
                        readily or generally imitated elsewhere. The various features of
                        civilization to which I referred seem to me to be as a rule in conflict,
                        rather than in harmony, in the affairs of men. Such conflicts exist even in
                        the highly advanced nations, where they are only successfully contained, not
                        resolved. There is often, for example, a conflict between social justice and
                        individual freedom, between egalitarianism and true liberty, between freedom
                        for the nation and freedom for the individual, between democracy and
                        national restraint.</p>
                    <p>You look on the various forms of authoritarianism and despotism, oligarchical
                        and autocratic, as abnormalities—as something to be overcome by better
                        living standards and enlightenment. I, on the contrary, <pb n="290"
                            xml:id="pg_290" facs="0322"/>see such forms of government as a part of
                        the natural state of mankind; our system, rather, is the exception and the
                        abnormality. I reflect, furthermore, that some of the most hideous
                        manifestations of modern totalitarianism have come in some of the most
                        highly industrialized and best educated countries. I am therefore skeptical
                        of your whole thesis. I suspect rapid social change itself to be the deepest
                        cause of the political instability and violence. For this reason, I expect
                        no good to come of the sort of precipitate development which you so warmly
                        embrace, particularly in an environment where population growth is to be
                        permitted to run rampant, with all that that implies. Whether absence of
                        encouragement on our part would steady these people down and temper the
                        demand for earlier industrialization, I doubt; but I still think it
                        irresponsible of us to encourage them along this path. By advancing along it
                        ourselves, we have only landed ourselves—as I shall have occasion to say
                        presently—in problems to which we see no answers. How can we, in good
                        conscience, impel others in the same direction?</p>
                    <p>You have a vision, in particular, of a humane Africa, divided into God knows
                        how many independent states, all with neat borders, U.N. membership, and all
                        the other trappings of sovereignty on the western pattern, and all thrusting
                        happily ahead into the nirvana of an industrial civilization. I see ahead in
                        this area, no matter what we do: primarily childishness, bewilderment,
                        inexperience, violence, racial hatred, and internecine strife of every sort,
                        the repetition (but in an era of devastating weaponry and population
                        explosion) of the long ordeal of political experience out of which the
                        public order of Europe has been bred. I cannot agree that it will always be
                        compatible with the safety of our country to increase the industrial
                        strength of these peoples, to put weapons into their hands, to discourage
                        violence among them, to encourage their proliferation. Divided and weak,
                        they are no menace to us. Given strength, God knows what they will do. I
                        wish them no harm. I would not see us move to injure them. But I regard our
                        American people of this mid-century, with all their faults, as almost the
                        only truly good-humored, well-meaning, and enlightened people of this age in
                        their attitude towards others. The peoples of the southern continents, in
                        particular, have, as I see it, no real belief in world brotherhood, and no
                        spontaneous sense of restraint in world affairs. Aside from what they think
                        they may get out of us at the moment in the way of immediate one-sided aid,
                        they would witness without a quiver of pity or regret the greatest
                        catastrophe of our civilization that the mind could conceive; and most of
                        them would be happy to be in at the kill.</p>
                    <p>In such circumstances, we should have a policy towards these people, as I see
                        it, devoid of illusions about their probable future, devoid in particular of
                        any fond belief that they are going to grow in our image, based rather on
                        the recognition that their advance to literacy and <pb n="291"
                            xml:id="pg_291" facs="0323"/>national consciousness is going to release
                        the most explosive and dangerous forces conceivable, and on a determination
                        to keep ourselves out of the way of these forces and in a position where
                        they cannot damage us.</p>
                    <p>All this may, of course, involve aid, given for tactical reasons, at one
                        point or another; but then, please, aid without illusions, without false
                        hopes, with clear eyes and the coldest sort of calculation. Perhaps this
                        view is conditioned by a failure to share the great concern so many people
                        feel over the expansion of Russian or Chinese influence into Africa in the
                        absence of major American counter-effort. It is true that this gives me
                        little concern. I think this cauldron of Africa can accept and consume all
                        the manpower and resources the Russians and the Chinese want to ship into
                        it, and that they will have no more profit than we would have by their
                        effort to remake it in their own image. Their ideas of civilization will be
                        just as irrelevant to the approaching chaos of that continent, it seems to
                        me, as will be ours.</p>

                    <p>The view put forward in your paper of what we should seek in the way of a
                        role of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in international life is, in
                        general, far closer to my views than that which was entertained in
                        Washington in earlier years. I still have certain fundamental differences,
                        however, with the general tendency of your paper (or do I mistake it?) to
                        seek multilateral channels of diplomacy wherever possible in preference to
                        bilateral ones. Insofar as problems of security are concerned, in the face
                        of the bloc, I am skeptical of the utility of collective and multilateral
                        arrangements, in many instances. I suspect that we lose more, by such
                        arrangements, in the way of promptness and flexibility of action and privacy
                        of decision than we gain in the way of added military and political
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>My main divergence, however, from the concept put forward in your paper,
                        relates to what can be done in the field of universal international action.
                        Here, I see possibilities which do not seem to me to be recognized in your
                        paper. The target of action ought to be, I think, those aspects of human
                        activity by which the integrity and hopefulness of our national environment
                        is being, or might be, adversely affected—such as, for example,
                        contamination of the atmosphere and of international waters in one way or
                        another, use of outer space, development of Antarctica, manipulation of
                        weather conditions, etc. Here, it seems to me, there is not only an
                        opportunity but a need for an actual narrowing of the concept of
                        international sovereignty, a concept which has been so grievously distorted
                        in this century, and so unwisely and lavishly bestowed on immature political
                        entities.</p>
                    <p>I have little confidence in multilateral associations based on the principal
                        of unanimity, or even of majority decisions, among a large number of nations
                        which retain, in relation to the matters under discussion, the full
                        prerogatives of absolute sovereignty. In the first case, that of <pb n="292"
                            xml:id="pg_292" facs="0324"/>unanimity, the necessary decisions will not
                        be taken; in the second case, they will not be enforced. I am impressed with
                        the advantages, illustrated by the European Iron and Steel Community, of the
                        transfer of sovereignty in the sense of the resigning of actual power of
                        decision within a limited area to an international body. Governments, by and
                        large, are timid and fearful of responsibility. They will happily submit to
                        dicta by an international body having genuine authority, even in instances
                        where, if they had been asked to share responsibility for the decision, they
                        would have been unwilling to do so. I would like, accordingly, to see the
                        establishment of international authorities with real power to do such things
                        as to control all use of outer space, to lay down and to enforce rules for
                        the preservation of the cleanliness and resources of the oceans, to say what
                        can and what cannot be done in the way of pollution of the atmosphere, to
                        administer the Antarctic, etc.</p>

                    <p>Underlying my misgivings about policy toward the underdeveloped areas are
                        certain fundamental doubts which I have about the trend of our society, and
                        particularly about the concepts which are outlined on pages 208-216 of your
                        paper. These doubts go very deep. I can do no more than to touch on them
                        here. They are the ones that cut to the heart of the whole question of the
                        desirability of a high degree of industrialization, urbanization, and
                        complexity in a society. I can only say that I have come, over the years, to
                        question the absolute application of the principle that the best way to have
                        things done is the way that is mechanically most efficient and involves the
                        least use of human labor. I do not think this is necessarily true, and I
                        have come to feel that the goal of economic and technological policy within
                        a society should not be just to discover the most efficient way of doing
                        things, in terms of human labor output, but rather to discover the ways of
                        doing things which are most beneficial to people themselves, which may be a
                        quite different thing. For this reason, I think that arbitrary decisions
                        ought to be made, of a type that we have never as yet contemplated:
                        decisions as to where to pause on the path of higher industrial efficiency,
                        and what sort of mechanical devices, affecting the patterns of human life,
                        to select among a choice that is now overwhelming in variety. I think, in
                        other words, that what our society now has to ask itself is: What is the
                        good life? How is it led? How is it best encouraged? And I think that we may
                        find that the answers to these questions are wholly different from those
                        which are being automatically produced by a policy of giving free rein to
                        the compulsions of technological efficiency.</p>
                    <p>In strongest contrast to the authors of your paper, I fail to see any
                        conclusive advantage in the principle of economic growth; on the contrary, I
                        see great dangers in it. I am unable to perceive that a society which is
                        able to discover its deepest values only in a process of constant
                        quantitative <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0325"/>multiplication—in a
                        state of instability, that is—is the best society. I would admire more a
                        society that can achieve a state of equilibrium in material and quantitative
                        terms and can seek its development in terms of the improvement and
                        enrichment of the individual human experience.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly concerned about the principle of unlimited economic
                        “growth,” because it involves precisely those features of our contemporary
                        American civilization which give me greatest concern: the progressive
                        over-crowding and urbanization of our territory, the reckless plundering of
                        its resources, and the increasing contamination of its natural elements. All
                        these things are connected with population growth and industrialization.
                        There can be no question but that our form of society is immensely wasteful
                        in terms of natural resources, and essentially unstable just from this
                        standpoint alone. As for population growth, this is not just, or even
                        primarily, a question of feeding people: it is a question of how such things
                        as privacy and access to nature are to be preserved in a crowded and heavily
                        urbanized society. I should have been inclined to regard 150 million as a
                        maximum desirable size for our population. When it gets beyond 200 million,
                        the effects—I am sure—will be appalling. I view this prospect with dismay,
                        not just from the standpoint of what will happen to the land and the water
                        and the air and the minerals, but also from the standpoint of what will
                        happen to the human soul and to the capacity for citizenship; for I regard a
                        certain connection with the land, with growing things, and even with
                        animals, as essential to spiritual health in the case of the great majority
                        of people.</p>
                    <p>As for the specific reasons which the paper states for maintaining a high
                        growth rate, I would only say the following: <list>
                            <label>A.</label>
                            <item>Other countries expect to get along, and to maintain their
                                security somehow, with a far smaller flow of resources than that
                                which we are contemplating. I see no great virtue involved in being
                                the world's strongest country in a material and military sense, if
                                this goal is to be pursued at the expense of the deeper human
                                values.</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>I do not see a flow of endlessly increasing resources as related
                                to an improvement in the standard of living. To look at things this
                                way is to accept the most vulgar and wasteful concept of what
                                compromises the good life, and to insist that people lead lives of
                                appalling complexity and artificiality.</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>I see no reason why a country must be in a state of explosive and
                                unnatural expansion in order to play a decent role in world trade.
                                Again, countries far smaller than ours make perfectly respectable
                                contributions in this field. If the developing countries
                                over-produce, I fail to see that it is our responsibility to assure
                                that they can unload this over-production on us. So far as
                                unemployment is concerned, the paper rests on assumptions which I
                                simply cannot accept. I think the real problem of chronic
                                unemployment in our country is very small indeed and could be easily
                                solved. <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0326"/>What we call
                                “unemployment” is simply a condition we have created by definition;
                                and what it refers to is primarily people who, in the face of the
                                fact that the government is willing to pay them for doing nothing,
                                prefer not to work at all rather than to accept the opportunities
                                for employment open in our society. We do ourselves the deepest
                                damage by the semantic confusion we produce when we speak of having
                                several million “unemployed”, because the condition of these people
                                is wholly different from that which most of the world's people
                                picture when they hear that word.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The above observations are simply suggestive of the extent to which my own
                        thinking has departed from that which is not only reflected in your paper
                        but is already accepted by a large portion of our intellectual community.
                        Having had your position in previous years, I am well aware that every paper
                        of this nature has to constitute, to a large extent, a compromise between
                        the private thinking of the individuals who draft it and that which will
                        find useful acceptance in wider circles. I do not mean, therefore, to
                        criticize or to assign blame when I point out these differences. To be
                        useful and to find acceptance, any paper would have to bow to the spirit of
                        the time and embrace many of the elements which yours does. It is I who am
                        out of step; and it is a good thing that it is you, not I, who occupy the
                        chair in which you now sit. If I am to make my peace with my
                        fellow-countrymen, intellectually, it will have to be in a different way,
                        and in a different forum. I say these things merely to point out why it is
                        difficult for me to comment as you have asked me to do.</p>

                    <p>As I indicated in my memo dated 17 February 1962, subject: A Requirements
                        Study for General Purpose Forces,<note n="1" xml:id="d86fn1">Not
                            found.</note> I would like you to <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295"
                            facs="0327"/>organize a study of requirements for tactical nuclear
                        weapons. I visualize this as a continuation of the General Purpose Forces
                            Study,<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">see <ref target="#d115">Document
                                115</ref>.</note> carried on by a nucleus of about ten officers from
                        the group conducting that study, beginning no later than July 1. Planning
                        for the study should begin now with selection of leaders and preparation of
                        terms of reference in collaboration with my staff.</p>
                    <p>I suggest that the first phase of the study be directed by Lt. General
                        Hamilton H. Howze, <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, with Major General
                        Paul S. Emrick, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, acting as his deputy.
                        General Howze should continue to direct the Army aviation study,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d86fn3">See <ref target="#d115fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                115</ref>.</note> but both he and General Emrick should be relieved
                        of other assignments until the first phase of the tactical nuclear weapons
                        study is completed. That should be accomplished by 1 October.</p>
                    <p>I would like the first phase of the study to concentrate on the use of
                        tactical nuclear weapons in ground and supporting air-to-ground combat in
                        Europe. I believe that our posture, doctrine, and understanding of
                        objectives for use of tactical nuclear weapons in ground combat in Europe is
                        in a very unsatisfactory state.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly concerned about the basis for requirements for the family
                        of nuclear weapons for Army ground forces from Davy Crockett and artillery
                        rounds to Pershing. What is the purpose of these weapons? In what
                        contingencies would they be used? And to achieve what objectives?</p>
                    <p>The case for having at least a relatively small number of tactical nuclear
                        weapons in the theatres (for example, a posture composed of nuclear weapons
                        for alert tactical aircraft, based in the theatre primarily for non-nuclear
                        combat anyway, and perhaps several battalions of Pershings to do nuclear
                        interdiction) appears to be based on such political and psychological
                        factors as the following: First, “the psychological position of our allies
                        without United States nuclear weapons in the theatres would be intolerable.”
                        Second, “the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in the theatre can help to
                        deter the Soviets from escalating a non-nuclear conflict to a nuclear
                        conflict, by threatening to transform a one-sided nuclear war into a
                        two-sided nuclear war.” Third, “having such weapons in the theatre may be
                        useful for purposes of detonating one or few on key military targets in time
                        of crisis as a way of showing our resolve or showing the Soviets the risks
                        inherent in the course of aggression in which they are engaged.” But the
                        objectives to be served by a larger posture of tactical atomic weapons and
                        the specific numbers and types of weapons required to meet those objectives
                        are quite unclear.</p>
                    <p>Are we buying Davy Crockett, Corporal, Sergeant, Lacrosse, Honest John,
                        Pershing, <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>'s, etc., to defend Europe in a
                        general nuclear war? If so, is not the return of the investment dubious;
                        does not all the evidence <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0328"/>suggest
                        that the long-range strategic forces would be decisive in such a conflict?
                        Moreover, if that were not the case for the planned posture, should we
                        acquire enough strategic weapons to make it so?</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, is the purpose of these weapons to defend Europe in a nuclear
                        war that is confined to the theatre? If so, a number of questions should be
                        considered. Is such a conflict at all likely? Would we meet a Soviet nuclear
                        attack in Europe without going to general war ourselves? Do we want to
                        devote resources to that contingency? Perhaps it would make more sense for
                        us to contract out of that possibility. On the other hand, would it be to
                        our advantage to go to nuclear war in the theatre in response to a Soviet
                        conventional attack? What evidence supports the notion that the use of
                        nuclear weapons is advantageous to the side with less manpower and superior
                        technology? Is it not at least as plausible that the bilateral use of
                        tactical atomic weapons in Europe would be to our military disadvantage? In
                        any case, is it feasible to defend Europe with nuclear weapons without
                        destroying it? Moreover, are we buying complete capabilities for such a war?
                        Are we buying complete weapons systems in the broad sense, i.e., complete
                        military capabilities able to live and fight in the nuclear environment, or
                        are we buying merely the weapons? Our lines of communication are vulnerable
                        to atomic attack and we seem to be doing nothing to remedy that. How do our
                        men survive fallout? How do we preserve command and control in the tactical
                        atomic environment? These problems do not appear to have been thought out.
                        Rather, it appears that the tactical atomic posture we have bought for our
                        forces in Europe may be preparation for World War II all over again, with
                        nuclear weapons overlaid. If we are not going to buy a complete posture for
                        the fighting of nuclear war in the theatres, but settle for a sort of
                        nuclear facade instead (as we appear to be doing today), then such a facade
                        can probably be procured at substantially less cost and risk than is
                        associated with our program.</p>
                    <p>In order to clarify and resolve these problems, I believe the study should
                        consider the following questions:</p>
                    <p>A. Examine the feasibility and outcome (in terms of military position and
                        civil damage) of a tactical-atomic war in Europe limited to the battle zone
                        and growing out of: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>A Soviet assault using tactical nuclears; and</item>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>Would such a war be feasible in the sense that stable limits could be found
                        that would keep it from escalating to an intercontinental nuclear war
                        involving major attacks on the U.S., Allied and Soviet homelands? Would such
                        a war be feasible in the sense that it would be possible to sustain
                        organized military operations despite nuclear attacks on command and control
                        airfields and <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>? Would escalation of a
                        non-nuclear conflict to the tactical nuclear level enable us to defend
                        Europe in circumstances in which we could not do so without the use of
                        nuclear weapons? <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0329"/>Which side gains
                        militarily from the bilateral use of nuclear weapons (as opposed to
                        limitation to non-nuclear weapons)?</p>
                    <p>B. Examine the role of tactical nuclear weapons in a general war initiated by
                        the Soviets. Evaluate the contribution to our success that would be made by
                        the various types of tactical nuclear weapons beyond the results that would
                        be achieved by the use of strategic nuclear weapons. Consider quantitatively
                        the implications for our ground forces of the Soviet use of strategic
                        nuclear weapons against them.</p>

                        first phase which concentrates on the use of tactical nuclear weapons in
                        ground and supporting air-to-ground combat in Europe will be completed by
                        October 1. This is a much needed effort to clarify doctrine and objectives
                        in an area where much cloudiness has existed up to now.</p>
                    <p>In connection with this matter, I recently took a fresh look at what we know
                        about Soviet tactical atomic weapons. Thanks to the intelligence source with
                        which you are familiar, we have quite a bit of comparatively new data. We
                        are reasonably sure, for example, that the Soviets have developed tactical
                        weapons for large caliber mortars, artillery pieces, certain free rockets
                        and short-range guided missiles, all of which are now in the hands of the
                        ground forces. Ranges vary from 11 to 300 nautical miles and yields from 5
                            <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> to several megatons.</p>
                    <p>Current Soviet military literature indicates a clear intention to use these
                        atomic weapons from the outset of any major operation in general war. We
                        have recently acquired the account of a Soviet army group exercise in the
                        Carpathians held in July 1961. The exercise consisted of an army group
                        attack against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces on a 250-mile
                        front, using some 25 divisions. The plan of attack corroborated known Soviet
                        military doctrine which calls for the allocation to an army group of 250 to
                        300 nuclear weapons with a total yield of from 120 to 150 megatons. In the
                        exercise, 60 to 75 of these weapons were used in a surprise first strike
                        against the opposing nuclear-equipped forces and against troop concentration
                        targets down to company size. About 70 warheads were physically moved about
                        in the area of the exercise. The foregoing figures were exclusive of
                        airplane-delivered weapons.</p>
                    <p>The conduct of the maneuver suggested the U.S. thinking on tactical weapons
                        which was current about 1955. The Soviets show a similar lack <pb n="300"
                            xml:id="pg_300" facs="0332"/>of appreciation of weapons effects which
                        would result in this maneuver from the high megaton dosage of the
                        battlefield. They appear to ignore the obstacles (craters, contamination,
                        forest fires, and blown-down trees) which their own weapons would create.
                        They are also at a loss to know how to find appropriate targets for the
                        overwhelming fire power in the hands of their troops.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are showing parallel concern to ours over the command and control
                        of atomic weapons. Soviet control procedures governing the tactical
                        employment of nuclear weapons appear to be highly centralized and designed
                        to prevent use except at the direction of the High Command. Evidence
                        indicates certain basic procedural steps, including (1) a specific decision
                        by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and the Party leaders
                        authorizing the use of nuclear weapons; (2) a determination by the High
                        Command Minister of Defense that a military requirement for nuclear weapons
                        exists on a given army group front and the specific notification to the
                        major field commanders that nuclear weapons may be released for use, as well
                        as a simultaneous notification to stockpile commanders that weapons have
                        been released; and (3) specific authorization by commanders of the rank of
                        an army commander or above for nuclear weapons to be released for designated
                        tactical use.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the review of our own policy on tactical atomic weapons,
                        it will be important to take a hard look at what the Soviets are doing or
                        may do.<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">In a May 24 memorandum to <persName

                        <item>The “billboard” effect of this <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> is
                            that the Soviets, in the US estimate, are about 4-5 years behind us in
                            their thinking on a suitable nuclear strategy, but their planning may
                            not evolve along the same lines that ours has.</item>

                        <item>The major divergency in US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            thinking concerns tactical nuclear weapons. The Soviets apparently will
                            not have, by 1964, incorporated low yield (fractional kiloton) nuclear
                            weapons into their inventory; the lowest yield we credit them with is 3
                                <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss>. (Chart, p 32). Since 1958 the
                            Soviets nevertheless have emphasized more the use of nuclear weapons in
                            support of field forces (p 13). Furthermore, the indications are that
                            this emphasis will increase in the future (p 27). Thus at a time in
                            which US planning calls for a decreased emphasis on tactical nuclear
                            weapons, Soviet thinking is calling for an increased one. The
                            implications of these divergent trends have not yet been fully explored.
                            They should be; hopefully the study on tactical nuclear weapons<note

                                86</ref>.</note> will do so. Also, if the Soviets find they cannot
                            fight using large yield tactical weapons because of fear of
                            self-inflicted damage on <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> troops,
                            our possession of low yield weapons could possibly give us a step in
                            escalation not open to the Soviets. This also should be looked
                            at.</item>

                        of a stable military environment requires strategic forces sufficiently
                        effective so that Sino-Soviet leaders would expect—without question—the
                        Bloc's present power position [relative to the US] to be worsened
                        drastically as a result of a general nuclear war. In assessing the
                        appropriate scale of a US effort designed to meet this requirement it should
                        be borne in mind that the Soviet calculus must take into account not merely
                        relative [US]-Soviet strength after a nuclear exchange but also its
                        consequences for the Communist position in Eastern Europe, for the relative
                        power of Communist China, and for the possibilities of maintaining Communist
                        control over the Russian base.”<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">All brackets are

                    <p>It seems to me that the resulting position is too weak. To say that our
                        strategic forces should only be able to worsen the Bloc's power position in
                        a general nuclear war is to set too modest an objective. The ability to
                        worsen the Bloc's power position as the result of a general nuclear war
                        would be easily satisfied in an absolute sense with a much less effective
                        strategic retaliatory force than we provide for in our present 5-year plan.
                        The concept of the relative strength of the U.S. to that of the Soviet Union
                        seems to me important to state clearly. Below are two formulations for you

                    <head>90. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>On June 6, 1962, the Policy Planning Council circulated a revised, 182-page
                        draft of the paper “Basic National Security Policy.” Once again, the paper's
                        fundamental structure remained unchanged, while numerous passages were
                        rewritten or amended. Among the changes are the following:</p>
                    <p>In Part One, “Principles and Purposes,” new language calls for accelerating
                        “constructive changes in the character and policies of the Communist
                        regimes, to erode the grip of Communism on peoples under its rule and to
                        facilitate their absorption into the community of free nations.” In a brief
                        segment concerning U.S. regional objectives, there is renewed emphasis on
                        the special importance of Iran and language on the need to make resolution
                        of South Asian issues such as the Kashmir and Pushtu questions “a major
                        objective of our diplomacy.”</p>
                    <p>In Part Two, “A Strategy,” under “Military Policy,” a new sentence states
                        that a major mission of U.S. forces is, in the event of war, “to bring about
                        a conclusion of hostilities on terms acceptable to the U.S. and its allies.”
                        A section on general war notes that while precise plans for the conduct of
                        operations in such a conflict cannot be drawn up in advance, preparations
                        against that possibility should aim at: reducing enemy strategic offensive
                        capabilities, particularly ability to “mount repetitive attacks against U.S.
                        population centers;” retaining forces for use against enemy population
                        centers and other “major elements of enemy strength;” and “facilitating the
                        conduct of negotiations designed to bring the war to an end on terms which
                        are consistent with U.S. interests, as set forth in this paper.” A very
                        similar paragraph appears in the March 26 draft but is missing from the May
                        7 draft.</p>
                    <p>A section on covert operations contains the added language, with respect to
                        such actions, that the United States “cannot accept an asymmetry which
                        allows Communist probes into the free community without possibility of
                        riposte.”</p>
                    <p>In a paragraph on current policy, also under “Military Policy,” a new
                        sentence is added to the paragraph (see <ref target="#d70">Document
                        70</ref>) stating that the United States should not set an absolute
                        requirement that its strategic forces be able to destroy substantially all
                        Soviet nuclear delivery systems in a first strike. “Such an objective does
                        not appear practical.” New introductory material appears in the section on
                        tactical nuclear weapons. It is unchanged in the portion of the June 22
                        draft printed as Document 93.</p>
                    <p>The paper states, still under “Military Policy,” that U.S. arms control
                        planning should be integrated with military planning. New language in the
                        June 6 draft expands this idea: “On the one hand, in proposing an arms
                        control measure, we must take into account its effect on relative <pb
                            n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0337"/>military capabilities and support
                        of national strategy. At the same time, military contingency plans, research
                        and development, and programming of armed forces and armaments should
                        reflect an awareness of the extent to which they affect stability in the
                        military environment, the evolution of weapons and doctrine, and the
                        likelihood of unauthorized use of weapons.” (Department of State, <gloss

                        such countries to maintain internal security. The Department of State has
                        prepared a list identifying the countries facing a threat of subversive
                        insurgency and will direct the formulation of outline plans for internal

                        country which encompass the total U.S.-supported internal defense field.
                        These plans will include the military, police, intelligence and

                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Communist Strategy</hi>. A persistent characteristic of
                        Communist military strategy has been its searching attention to specific
                        gaps—regional and technical—in the defense of the free community. It has
                        been, thus far, an evident purpose of Communist strategy to avoid a direct
                        confrontation not only with U.S. main strength, but with positions of
                        relative strength within the free community of other nations as well. Soviet
                        policy appears to be based on pressure against particular areas of
                        vulnerability (e.g., Northern Azerbaijan, Greece, Berlin, Indochina, South
                        Korea, etc.) and particular types of vulnerability (e.g., the geographical
                        position of Berlin, the inadequate defenses against subversion and guerrilla
                        warfare in Laos and South Viet-Nam, etc.)</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Future Threats</hi>. Given foreseeable U.S. nuclear
                        capabilities, including, in particular, our powerful ability to strike
                        second, it is estimated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will
                        not deliberately take actions which would bring about general nuclear war.
                        There is, nevertheless, always a possibility that the Soviets may
                        miscalculate U.S. capabilities or misjudge U.S. intentions. They may
                        calculate that their growing nuclear strength makes non-nuclear aggression,
                        especially against areas believed to be not vital to U.S. interests, a
                        feasible course of action. They may also under-estimate the importance
                        attached by the U.S. to particular interests or areas, and initiate action
                        in the belief that the U.S. will not respond. Accordingly, it is a first
                        charge on U.S. military policy to make grossly unattractive and unprofitable
                        a direct Soviet assault on the U.S. or on other vital areas, notably Western
                        Europe. But a major lesson of postwar history is that U.S. and allied policy
                        must also achieve, to the maximum degree possible, a closing off of all
                        areas of vulnerability, if we wish to minimize the number and effectiveness
                        of Communist probes. It is this lesson which calls for the U.S. and its
                        allies to develop a fuller range of military capabilities, capable of
                        covering as much as feasible of the free community, if they are to create a
                        stable overall military environment.</p>

                        Although the military stance of the free community is basically defensive,
                        the U.S. and its allies also require capabilities for limited overt and
                        covert action in areas under Communist control. Such action must be
                        carefully weighed in the light of particular circumstances, costs, and
                        risks; but the U.S. cannot accept an asymmetry which allows Communist probes

                    <p>The prospect of confronting reserve U.S. nuclear forces after any attack may
                        give a potential enemy powerful incentive to refrain from planning or
                        executing unrestricted attacks on U.S. or Allied civil society. Such ready
                        forces, held in reserve and threatening—by their very exist-ence—surviving
                        enemy targets, may also conceivably extend deterrence into the wartime
                        period, and thus destroy the will of surviving enemy leaders to pursue
                        unrestricted attacks or to continue the war. Moreover, the goal of ending
                        hostilities on acceptable terms requires that plans and operational
                        decisions preclude the prospect of an unarmed U.S. confronting armed
                        opponents. <hi rend="italic">For all these reasons, it is essential—whatever

                        relates to the optimum use of nuclear weapons if we must initiate such
                        use.</p>
                    <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0347"/>
                    <p>On the one hand, since 1945 American policy has ruled out the initiation of
                        nuclear attack on the Soviet Union as a means of bringing the cold war to an
                        end and providing a definite victory for the Free World. Aside from its
                        violation of our moral and political tradition a policy of initiating
                        nuclear war was always shadowed by its consequences for Western Europe; and
                        its rationality on strictly military grounds has been gradually reduced with
                        the Soviet acquisition of medium and long-range nuclear delivery
                        capabilities.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we are committed explicitly to defend the populations and
                        territory of Western Europe, and we have similar though implicit commitments
                        to use nuclear weapons rather than accept major defeat in Asia and the
                        Middle East.</p>
                    <p>This situation immediately raises the question of whether, if we initiated
                        use of nuclear weapons, a limited use of nuclear weapons with a concomitant
                        risk of escalation of nuclear engagement by the other side would be the
                        sensible course to follow, or whether an initial strike against Soviet
                        strategic nuclear delivery systems would be the optimum course.</p>
                    <p>At the present time this question—involving complex problems of intelligence
                        assessment and projection as well as evolving military technology—is subject
                        to legitimate debate. The answer may well vary according to circumstances
                        which cannot be foreseen in advance.</p>

                        military advantage. It could rapidly lead to general nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>A very limited use of nuclear weapons, primarily for purposes of
                        demonstrating our will and intent to use such weapons, might bring Soviet

                    <p>It is also conceivable that the limited tactical use of nuclear weapons on

                    <p>Highly dispersed nuclear weapons in the hands of troops would be difficult to
                        control centrally. Accidents and unauthorized acts could well occur on both

                        great flexibility of nuclear systems, the enormous firepower contained in a
                        single weapon, the ease and accuracy with which that firepower can be called
                        in from unattacked and hence undamaged distant bases, the crucial importance

                            national military power, such a program would promote the growth of more

                            international disputes, and development of an international peace force
                            capable of effectively protecting all nations against breaches of the

                    <p>By June 1962 there was considerable discussion within the U.S. Government of
                        the ultimate disposition of the paper on “Basic National Security Policy”
                        (see <ref target="#d70">Documents 70</ref>, <ref target="#d83">83</ref>,
                            <ref target="#d90">90</ref>, and <ref target="#d93">93</ref>). At times
                        consideration of the question was intermingled with that of the publicity
                        the paper had received, a development described in <ref target="#d95"
                            >Document 95</ref>.</p>
                    <p>On June 13, 1962, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                        in a letter covering a list of changes in the May 7 draft proposed by his
                        Department, wrote Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> that
                        “the thrust of the proposed policy seems highly suitable,” and that as
                        “between the short and the long versions of the paper, I believe the long
                        version to be the preferable format. The shorter one lacks the amplifying
                        background so necessary to full understanding of policy statements as well
                        as to setting the tone of policy.” <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> suggested that more sensitive portions of the final

                    <p>On June 26, 1962, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George W. Ball</persName> testified before
                        the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with respect to their work on the
                        Department of State drafts of “Basic National Security Policy.” This
                        testimony was occasioned by a series of news accounts of the drafts,
                        especially two articles by Willard Edwards that appeared in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Chicago Tribune</hi> on June 17-18. Edwards stated that
                        the main theme of the paper was that Soviet domestic and foreign policies
                        were “mellowing,” but that military and intelligence officials who had seen
                        the draft believed that it adduced no evidence to support this
                        assertion.</p>
                    <p>In his testimony, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stated that
                        “mellowing” was “not a word of my choice” and that although there were
                        significant changes in the Soviet Union which held a long-term hope of
                        liberalization they did “not affect current policy.” They might “in the long
                        run, as Secretary Dulles used to point out,” but meanwhile there were
                        dangerous confrontations in Berlin, South Vietnam, and Laos. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> then gave extensive testimony on his
                        views on a wide range of foreign policy and national security topics.</p>
                    <p>Members of the Committee requested copies of the current draft, but <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> refused on the ground that it was a
                        document “under the control of the National Security Council,” and therefore
                        any such request would have to be made directly to the President. On July 3,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stated before the Committee
                        that he would ask the President about possible publication of <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s testimony given on June 26.

                    <p>At his press conference on June 27, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                            >Kennedy</persName> was asked whether he had assigned the writing of the
                        paper to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> “or did he just
                        undertake it on his own to interpret policies of the Government?”
                            <persName>Kennedy</persName> stated that “we have in the National
                        Security Council voluminous papers from the Fifties which are the general
                        guide of policy lines in the United States. But there have been a good many
                        changes since the nineteen-fifties.” He continued: “We are examining to see
                        guerilla warfare, anti-insurgency, what should be our military policy in it,
                        what should be our force levels. These are matters which both the State
                        Department and the Department of Defense are examining and will <pb n="332"

                        Council and to see whether there should be any changes in the policies that
                        we laid down—were laid down in the nineteen-fifties.” He concluded: “I have
                        not studied the paper; the Secretary of State has it. But Mr. <persName

                            striking forces. First, as forces for attack on Eurasia are reaching
                            planned levels, greater emphasis is being placed on forces for
                            intercontinental attack, especially <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss>s. Second, the Soviets are attempting <pb n="333"
                                xml:id="pg_333" facs="0365"/>to improve their capabilities for both
                            preemptive and retaliatory action, by measures designed to shorten
                            reaction times and increase survivability.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The tempo of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program has
                            quickened. The present relatively modest force level of about 50
                            operational launchers will probably grow substantially, reaching some
                            125-175 launchers in mid-1963 and 200-300 in mid-1964.<note n="2"

                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force will probably be
                            deployed at launch sites having some degree of hardening.</item>

                        <item>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is developing a
                            submerged-launch ballistic missile submarine system, with medium or
                            intermediate range missiles. This improved system will probably be
                            incorporated into some portion of the 40 or so existing ballistic
                            missile submarines, and into a new submarine class. Soviet submarines
                            armed with cruise-type missiles are also capable of attacking land
                            targets. Within the next few years, Soviet nuclear-powered missile
                            submarines will probably be conducting regular patrols within firing
                            range of the US.</item>

                            improve. Their limited bomber capability against North America will be
                            tailored increasingly to conduct missions supplementary to ballistic

                            range striking forces and a general upward trend in weapon yields.
                            Within the next few years, limited numbers of very high yield weapons in
                            the 25-100 megaton range will be available for delivery by bombers and
                            probably <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. Ground-launched missile
                            units are believed to have more than one missile per launcher, to

                        <item>The Soviets regard forces for long range attack as essential for
                            supporting an aggressive political posture, deterring the West from
                            resort to military action, and fighting a war as effectively as possible
                            should one occur. In our view, they are building forces which they
                            regard as appropriate to these objectives rather than attempting to
                            achieve the very high degree of superiority required to launch a
                            deliberate attack on the West. Efforts to gear their forces better for
                            both preemptive and retaliatory operations, along with greater emphasis
                            upon forces capable of attacking the US, are the major new developments
                            in the Soviet programs for long range striking forces.</item>

                        <item>In building these forces, the Soviets put initial stress on creating a

                            systems occurred earlier and in much larger numbers. This pattern is
                            probably changing. We believe that deployment of medium range systems is
                            approaching the planned level, and that major emphasis is now being
                            given to further development of forces for intercontinental attack,

                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> almost certainly relates to a
                            Soviet decision to deploy the first generation system in only limited
                            numbers. The SS-6 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> is a very large
                            vehicle of nearly half a million pounds gross takeoff weight, with
                            nonstorable liquid propellants and radio-inertial guidance. Ground
                            control and support facilities are correspondingly large and include
                            rail service direct to launchers. The second generation SS-7 <gloss

                            bulky, and probably employs storable liquid propellants and all-inertial
                            guidance. A typical SS-7 complex consists of a rail-served support area
                            and eight or more launchers, which are deployed in pairs and are

                            having some degree of hardening. Considering past Soviet practices, we
                            estimate that there will be two <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            launchers at each site. The first of these new sites will probably be
                            operational in early 1963. It is probable that such sites are to employ
                            either the SS-7 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> with redesigned

                        submarines, including 7 diesel-powered “Z” class, 25 diesel-powered “G”
                        class, and 10 nuclear-powered “H” class submarines. This force carries a
                        total of about 120 ballistic missiles with ranges up to 350 n.m. The
                        effectiveness of these submarines is limited by the small number of missiles
                        each carries, the short range of the missiles, and the requirement for
                        submarines to surface for launching. There is reliable evidence, however,
                        that the Soviets are now developing a capability to launch ballistic
                        missiles from submerged submarines. The range of the missiles may be either
                        650 or 2,000 n.m. A program to retrofit some portion of the existing force
                        of about 35 “G” and “H” class submarines will probably begin soon. All of
                        these submarines could be so equipped within the next two or four years. A
                        new nuclear-powered submarine class is probably also under development to
                        employ this new missile system; we estimate that the first submarine could

                        missile systems, designed primarily for low altitude, supersonic attack
                        against Western surface ships, particularly carrier task forces. They are
                        now carried by a few converted diesel-powered submarines and at least four
                        nuclear-powered submarines. We believe that the Soviets are now extending
                        their capability to attack land targets with missiles of this type.</p>

                    <p>20. Soviet Long Range Aviation, by reason of its equipment, basing, and
                        deployment, is much better suited to Eurasian operations than to
                        intercontinental attack. We estimate that as of mid-1962 Long Range Aviation
                        comprises some 165 heavy bombers and 950 jet medium bombers.<note n="6"

                    <p>21. In attempting to overcome the range limitations of Long Range Aviation
                        for intercontinental attack, the Soviets have given considerable emphasis to
                        aerial refueling and Arctic training in Badger and Bison units. Most of the
                        Bears have been modified to deliver 350 n.m. air-to-surface missiles. We
                        believe that the Soviets might plan to commit as many as 400-500 aircraft to
                        initial attacks on North America. Considering a variety of operational
                        factors, but excluding combat attrition, we estimate that the Soviets could
                        now put about 200 bombers over North America on two-way missions in initial
                        attacks; of these nearly half could be heavy bombers. The patterns of Arctic
                        training and base utilization indicate that aircraft would probably be
                        staged through a few bases in successive waves over a number of hours.<note

                            of attack. He further believes that the Soviets could commit about 750
                            aircraft to initial two-way attacks on North America. Considering
                            operational factors and allowing for noncombat attrition, about 300
                            bombers could reach North American targets. [Footnote in the source

                    <p>22. The present Soviet stockpile consists almost entirely of weapons
                        developed from nuclear tests conducted prior to the 1961 test series. Most
                        of the weapons allotted to Long Range Aviation are probably high-yield types
                        ranging from about 100 <gloss target="#t_KT1">KT</gloss> to 8 <gloss
                            target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss>. Ballistic missiles now in service could
                        deliver warheads with maximum yields in the megaton range. <gloss
                            target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s are probably also equipped with lower
                        yield warheads. Naval cruise-type missiles and air-to-surface missiles are
                        probably armed with warheads of low or medium yield for use against ships,
                        but could deliver warheads in the low megaton range against land or coastal
                        targets. The general trend in the yields of weapons allotted to long range
                        attack will probably be upwards. A few very high yield bombs of 25 <gloss
                            target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss>, or even 100 <gloss target="#t_MT1"
                            >MT</gloss>, could now be available. It is possible that a few <gloss

                        continue to strengthen and modernize its long range striking forces, with
                        emphasis on those systems capable of attacking the US. The effort devoted to
                        long range attack forces will be affected by the competing demands of other
                        essential military and nonmilitary programs. We cannot estimate with
                        confidence the decisions the Soviet leaders will make or the success they
                        are likely to achieve in various weapons programs. However, we believe that

                        will be retained, the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> will be the

                    <p>24. The Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program will be
                        influenced by a variety of factors: Soviet strategic concepts, technical
                        improvements, other Soviet weapons programs, the nature and size of Western
                        forces, and the international situation. These factors place broad limits on
                        the future Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force but do not
                        lead us too particular program. For this reason we can only estimate the
                        Soviet force level within a broad range. All things considered, we believe
                        the Soviet force level in mid-1967 will be within the range of 300-600
                        operational launchers. The majority of launchers will probably have a degree
                        of hardening, including some fully hardened. To achieve the high side of the
                        range, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would need to commit
                        resources throughout this period at rates at least as high as those now

                        launchers will probably have more than one missile available, to provide a
                        refire capability. Our estimate, reflecting the considerable range of
                        uncertainty in any figures for this period, is as follows:</p>

                    <p>25. The smaller force would give the Soviets high assurance in an initial
                        attack of destroying US soft fixed nuclear bases, semihardened <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites, communication and control
                        facilities, and the principal US metropolitan areas. The larger force would
                        provide an additional attack capability against some hardened targets,
                        control centers, and other elements contributing to US striking and
                        defensive strength, and would increase the Soviet retaliatory capability. We
                        believe that the programmed buildup in US intercontinental attack forces
                        makes it increasingly unlikely that the Soviets would judge that they could
                        launch an <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0372"/>on US nuclear forces and
                        inflict sufficient damage to assure that resulting damage to the <gloss

                    <p>26. The accuracy, reliability, and reaction time of the <gloss

                        communications, and other equipment will increase its flexibility and
                        capability for simultaneous attack. The bulk of the force will probably be
                        equipped with warheads in the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source

                        survivability of the force, the Soviets will probably continue to deploy
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s at launchers which are dispersed
                        and have some degree of hardening. They will also probably develop a fully
                        hardened system which we believe could become operational in 1965 or
                        1966.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> and

                    <p>27. Soviet strength in these systems will probably have been stabilized
                        before 1965 at approximately 550-650 operational launch pads. To improve the
                        survivability of the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> force, the
                        Soviets may also develop road mobile or hardened systems.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Submarine-Launched Forces</hi></p>
                    <p>28. Soviet planners will probably look upon submarine missile forces as an
                        important supplement to their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength
                        because of their relative invulnerability and their capability for varying
                        the direction and nature of attacks on the US. We believe that the number of
                        nuclear-powered submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles will be
                        on the order of 25-30 in mid-1967. The Soviets will probably also have about
                        two dozen nuclear submarines equipped with cruise-type missiles. In
                        addition, diesel-powered missile submarines will remain in operation. The
                        ranges of submarine-launched missiles may be extended to as much as 2,000
                        n.m. for ballistic missiles, and to 650 n.m. for cruise missiles. By the
                        mid-1960's, some Soviet nuclear-powered missile submarines will probably be
                        conducting regular patrols within missile range of US coasts.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Bomber Forces</hi></p>
                    <p>29. With the growth and improvement of missile capabilities, the Soviets
                        would probably plan to employ bomber forces in follow-on attacks after
                        initial missile strikes had been delivered or to supplement the retaliatory
                        blow if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were attacked first.
                        Aircraft equipped with improved penetration aids and nuclear weapons would
                        probably be used for increasingly specialized missions, such as armed
                        reconnaissance and attacks on hard targets. By mid-1967, Long Range Aviation
                        will probably include some 750 medium bombers, about one-third of them
                        supersonic Blinders. Heavy bomber strength will probably have been reduced
                        to about 100 aircraft. We estimate as follows the strength of Long Range
                        Aviation in the mid-1960's:</p>

                    <p>30. We have no evidence of Soviet plans or programs for the military use of
                        space. We think it highly unlikely, however, that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would omit this field in its vigorous
                        search for qualitative improvements in its military posture and for
                        achievements with which to support claims of superiority. We believe that
                        the Soviets could launch reconnaissance, communications, meteorological,
                        navigation, or geodetic satellites at any time. There is no evidence that
                        the Soviets are working to develop offensive space weapon systems, but the
                        course of the Soviet space program to date suggests that any effort in this
                        field would be directed toward an orbital bombardment vehicle. It would be
                        technically feasible for the Soviets to launch weapons of limited capability
                        into orbit in the mid-1960's, but we do not believe they could achieve an
                        effective offensive capability by the end of the decade.<note n="13"
                            xml:id="d96fn13">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss

                            bombardment capability could be achieved prior to the end of the decade.
                            Based on technical considerations and using a (large) SS-8 booster and
                            techniques known to exist today or to be within Soviet capability, he
                            believes that such a system could be developed as early as 1965. This
                            system could be composed of orbital vehicles of 30,000 pounds gross
                            weight, which could deorbit a very high yield weapon to a CEP of 4 n.m.
                            initially and later to 1.8 n.m. [Footnote in the source

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Implications of Capabilities</hi></p>
                    <p>31. The capabilities of Soviet long range striking forces will be only in
                        part a function of the numbers of weapons available, their performance, and
                        the adequacy of supporting elements. Equally critical will be the way in
                        which the Soviets employ their striking forces, their ability to maximize
                        the effects of these forces under the various circumstances in which war
                        could begin, and their assessment of Western capabilities and plans.</p>
                    <p>32. The current Soviet targeting concept reflects the view that even a
                        general nuclear war is likely to be protracted and that victory requires the
                        reduction of all elements of the Western warmaking potential. These <pb
                            n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0374"/>elements include: the bases of
                        strategic delivery systems; nuclear weapons facilities; communication and
                        governmental centers; military and war supporting industry. We have no
                        evidence that avoidance of heavy civilian casualties is among the objectives
                        underlying Soviet targeting.</p>
                    <p>33. Should the Soviets conclude that the West was irrevocably committed to an
                        imminent nuclear attack on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, they
                        would launch their available ready forces in a pre-emptive attack designed
                        to blunt the expected Western blow. The mixed force which they have
                        available for such operations would permit flexibility of tactics and
                        complicate Western defensive problems, but would pose severe difficulties of
                        coordination. Initial missile and bomber attacks against the US would
                        probably extend over a period of many hours, and those against Eurasia over
                        at least a few hours. We believe that at present the Soviets would plan to
                        employ few if any missile submarines in initial attacks against the US;
                        initiation of routine submarine patrols within missile range of the US could
                        change this situation.</p>
                    <p>34. By the mid-1960's, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will have
                        acquired a substantial missile capability to deliver nuclear weapons against
                        the US, in addition to its already formidable forces for strikes in Eurasia.
                        Significant portions of this force will be relatively invulnerable to
                        attack. The Soviets will be in a position to strike pre-emptively at the
                        fixed bases of an important segment of the US nuclear delivery force, and
                        they will have some prospect that a portion of their own force could survive
                        an initial US attack and retaliate with high yield nuclear weapons. With the
                        long range striking forces we estimate that they will have in the
                        mid-1960's, however, the Soviets could still not expect to destroy the
                        growing numbers of US hardened, airborne, seaborne, and fast reaction
                        nuclear delivery vehicles.<note n="14" xml:id="d96fn14">On July 7, <persName

                        noted the President's request that “a study be made of the effect on the

                    <p>There is hereby submitted the report of the interagency committee created
                        pursuant to your request in National Security Action Memorandum 146.<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d99fn1">The 22-page report is not printed. (Ibid.)
                            Regarding <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 146, see <ref
                                target="#d72fn3">footnote 3, Document 72</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Briefly, the Committee believes that the U.S. police assistance programs form
                        a very important but neglected part of our intensified effort to help
                        emerging nations counter subversion and insurgency. Such programs are
                        particularly helpful as “preventive medicine”, since the police are normally
                        responsible for coping with urban and rural dissidence before it reaches
                        major proportions. Moreover, police assistance costs very little in
                        comparison to the potential return. For example, in the peak year of <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 the cost of <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                            >AID</gloss> programs in 21 countries, involving 690,000 police, totaled
                        only about $14,000,000. In that year, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        programs ran $5,800,000 in 5 countries. It is also worth noting that the
                        Bloc has not to date provided much competition in this field. We and our
                        allies should continue to pre-empt them in this highly sensitive area.</p>
                    <p>However, police programs in general, despite their repeated highest level
                        endorsement since 1954, have not received the U.S. Government attention they
                        deserve. The most serious weakness has been lack of strong central direction
                        by the responsible agencies and comparative neglect by their policy-level
                        officials over the past several years. We have also identified serious
                        technical shortcomings that limit the effectiveness of our programs.</p>
                    <p>The Committee further believes that we have set our program sights too low.
                        The U.S. should increase its emphasis on the use of police programs as
                        counter-insurgency tools wherever there is a clearly demonstrable need.
                        After a quick survey, we feel that the U.S. could perhaps usefully invest up
                        to double the present program level over the next year or so, if adequate
                        personnel can be found. Thereafter we would envisage a more gradual
                        increase, but almost certainly a continued substantial one in view of the
                        increasing number of new countries needing such help. Indeed, we doubt that
                        there is another aspect of the U.S. internal defense effort where greater
                        gains can be realized at such small cost.</p>
                    <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0378"/>
                    <p>But police assistance programs will not reach their full potential unless the
                        program is given more vigorous management. While the Committee believes that
                        this management should be civilian in character, and thus should remain
                        logically in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, this agency must greatly
                        strengthen its capabilities to manage police programs if the objective is to
                        be achieved.</p>
                    <p>Much improved training, both of foreign police personnel and of U.S.
                        trainers, is another pressing need. Since present U.S. facilities are wholly
                        inadequate, there should be established in the U.S. an international police
                        academy for this purpose. Detailed studies should immediately be undertaken
                        to this end. The U.S. needs to develop a professional cadre of experienced
                        police advisors, few of whom exist at present.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the Committee recommends that you approve the following
                        recommendations which are designed to overcome these shortcomings and to
                        give proper focus to a key element in the U.S. internal defense effort:<note

                    <p>I thought you might want to acquaint yourself with the draft report prior to
                        our meeting on the final version for formal submission to you, and I would
                        of course appreciate any comments you might have at this stage. I also want
                        to alert you to the one disagreement in our considerations.</p>
                    <p>The divergence of view concerns the implications for our own programs of more
                        rapid Soviet advances in anti-missile programs than we had previously
                        expected. In our view, the rapid Soviet development of an anti-<gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system, and recent initiation of
                        deployment of an anti-<gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> system, counsels
                        a fresh look at our decisions on deployment of an anti-missile system. We do
                        not believe that we should inject ourselves into the controversy within the
                        Pentagon over whether the degree of military utility of the presently
                        developed anti-missile systems, in particular the Nike Zeus, is sufficient
                        to justify at this time a decision on grounds of the military capabilities
                        of that system. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        has concluded that it is not. However, since the question is one of degree,
                        and since there will be powerful political and propaganda repercussions of
                        who is first in deploying anti-missile defenses, we do believe that the
                        question should be reexamined with due weight given to the political
                        considerations favoring deployment as quickly as feasible at least on a
                        limited scale.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul Nitze</persName> and, we understand, Bob
                        McNamara prefer not to raise this question. Nevertheless, it seems to us
                        that there is an appropriate policy implication of the new intelligence,
                        calling for a recommendation to look again at this question. We would like
                        to discuss this subject with you further, at an appropriate time, but I
                        wanted now to outline the difference as it presently stands within our
                        committee. The view of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> is not yet
                        clear, and that of Max Taylor is not known. <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> has informally indicated agreement with the view we had
                        advanced, but they prefer not to engage directly on the issue other than to
                        support our reading of the intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Chip Bohlen and Foy Kohler have taken the lead in drawing the foreign policy
                        implications.</p>

                    <p>The Special Group for Counterinsurgency was established on January 18, 1962
                        to assure the integrated and most effective use of all available resources
                        to prevent and resist subversive insurgency and related forms of indirect
                        aggression in friendly countries. While the Special Group (<gloss

                        U.S. counterinsurgency activities, certain major functional categories stand
                        out. These are doctrine, organization, training, research and development,
                        paramilitary assets, country internal defense plans, foreign training, and
                        civic action.</p>

                    <p>In order to reach agreement on the nature of the problem, to establish common

                        became necessary at the outset to formulate doctrine and policy guidance.
                        The Department of State in collaboration with the other departments and
                        agencies concerned has prepared a statement of national doctrine, which is

                        counterinsurgency activities. A chart setting forth the organization for

                        within them. The Department of State has directed Chiefs of Mission to
                        develop country internal defense plans. These plans will be reviewed by the

                        September. In the meantime, one plan—that for Colombia—has been approved and
                        returned to the Ambassador for discussion with the host government and
                        subsequent implementation. Another, a preliminary plan for Thailand, has

                        as they are in Washington, and through periodic status reports prepared by

                    <p>We would like to draw your attention particularly to the following broad
                        conclusions of the study: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The new estimates of Soviet capabilities for long range attack,
                                and of other Soviet military capabilities, do not require basic
                                revisions or changes either in our foreign policy or in our current
                                defense policy.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>While intending to avoid war, the Soviets expect their growing
                                strategic strength to lend increasing weight to their foreign
                                policies. On a general level, growing Soviet capabilities will
                                strengthen the Soviet leaders' belief in their ability to influence
                                the course of events in all areas of the world. In particular issues
                                involving a direct clash of Soviet-American interests, however, more
                                acute considerations of military risk figure in Soviet
                                calculations.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Soviets previously were willing to act only with caution on
                                the basis of a capability which they knew existed mainly in their
                                opponents' minds. Their appraisal of risks may change now that their
                                capability has become real and is growing. We recognize this
                                possibility and its hazards for the period ahead. We nevertheless
                                regard it as likely that the Soviets will not abandon caution in
                                Soviet-American confrontations, including Berlin. We believe they
                                recognize that there are limits to the challenges which they can
                                pose without incurring the risk of military response by the
                                U.S.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The Soviets will almost certainly test Western, and particularly
                                American, reactions in order to judge whether their gains in
                                strength have so inhibited the U.S. as to widen the scope of action
                                which they can undertake without substantial risk of war. But the
                                depth and vigor of their probing will depend more upon their
                                estimate of U.S. reactions than on their calculations of relative
                                military strength. Accordingly, they will not, in our view,
                                automatically conclude that actions which were heretofore too risky
                                have now become tolerably safe. It is also important to note that
                                the calculations of relative military strength and Western reactions
                                to probes are only part of the host of factors which will affect
                                Soviet decisions.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>It is clear that the Soviet successes with sputniks and <gloss
                                    target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> tests in 1957-1958 had much to do
                                with inspiring the confidence which led the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> to open its challenge on the Berlin question in
                                November 1958. Beyond this general observation, we find no precise
                                relationship in timing between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>'s Berlin tactics and the progress of its buildup
                                in strategic forces. In particular, the quickening of the tempo of
                                the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program in 1961 seems
                                unlikely to have resulted from any new decisions regarding Berlin.
                                It reflects development and deployment decisions taken several years
                                previously. The fairly regular buildup of intercontinental forces of
                                all kinds projected in the estimate for the next year or so does not
                                suggest that Soviet efforts are concentrated toward reaching <pb

                            <item>The Soviet forces now estimated for the period 1962-1967 are of a

                                in developing our own recommended strategic force mix (force levels
                                and weapons systems) for this period. Soviet <gloss

                                estimated for the period to be approximately of the size forecast in
                                the intelligence estimates dated September 19, 1961,<note n="3"

                                    substantially lower than the June 7, 1961 (<gloss

                                the assumed high and median Soviet postures used by <gloss

                                forces last fall. The new estimates indicate that a hardening
                                program may be proceeding somewhat sooner than previously
                                anticipated, but again the total number of hardened sites forecast
                                for the period is still well below our planning assumption figures
                                for 1965 and 1967. Perhaps the principal unknown presented for our
                                planning is the influence which introduction of large yield
                                weapons—and their number—may have on future Soviet offensive and
                                defensive capabilities. While such weapons were taken into account
                                in our force planning last fall, there are still uncertainties as to
                                some of their physical effects which must be resolved before their
                                full military implications can be determined.</item>

                            <item>Our present re-examination of the situation in light of the latest
                                estimates of Soviet posture indicates that the objectives we have
                                been seeking through our recommended strategic forces mix and other
                                programs are still essentially valid. In brief, these objectives
                                have been: first, to provide the United States with the capability,
                                even under unfavorable circumstances of war outbreak, to deny the
                                Soviet Union the prospect of military victory or of knocking out the
                                U.S. retaliatory force, while at the same time assuring prompt
                                destruction of a high proportion of Soviet nuclear bases and
                                remaining nuclear forces; second, to retain a large protected
                                reserve force for (a) follow-on attacks against Soviet military
                                forces, (b) attacks if necessary against Soviet urban society, and
                                (c) attempting to bring the war to a negotiated end without attacks
                                on cities.</item>

                                strategy which it supports would appear to be that the Soviets hope

                                continuing political pressure, subversion and various forms of
                                unconventional warfare under the umbrella of their growing strategic
                                power. At the same time, they would hope to capitalize on their
                                conventional military power by the implicit threat of bringing it to
                                bear in situations where they have a local conventional superiority.
                                The broad conclusion to be drawn for our defense policy is to
                                reaffirm the importance of shaping our military posture so as to
                                provide credible military options over a wide spectrum of
                                contingencies from general war at one end to local wars and minor
                                aggressions at the other. It is also important to reaffirm that our
                                own strategic forces must provide a corresponding umbrella under
                                which we may meet Soviet confrontation on lesser scales than general
                                war.</item>

                            <item>We judge the greatest hazard to be in the Soviet calculation (or
                                miscalculation) of the risks of particular courses of action as
                                Soviet military capabilities grow. A dangerous change in the
                                calculus of risks would of course be most likely if the Soviets
                                thought they had obtained a temporary military superiority,
                                especially in the field of AICBMs, whether or not we shared that
                                estimate. The current estimates of future Soviet military strength,
                                and current U.S. defense programs, do not lead us to expect such a
                                situation. Nonetheless, it should be a basic task of the United
                                States, if possible, to see to it that this military advantage does
                                not occur and to this end to give the highest priority to the
                                established defense programs of the United States and to continue
                                and, if possible, to increase the effectiveness of our intelligence
                                collection systems, and to conduct effective informational programs
                                to blunt Soviet efforts to exploit politically real or alleged
                                Soviet military advances, such as an anti-missile capability.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s desire to overcome the
                            advantage which the US had enjoyed in this vital ingredient of the power
                            equation. The Soviet weapons programs are obviously aimed at obtaining
                            greater security for the Bloc and greater freedom for Soviet policy in
                            the face of the immense threat posed by US strategic power. Within the
                            last year, with the availability of a more suitable second-generation
                            missile, a rapidly unfolding deployment program has carried the Soviets
                            farther toward these aims.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Soviet View of the Risks of
                            War</hi></p>
                        <p>2. It is clear, from the trends in Soviet strategic capabilities
                            estimated in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-62, that the
                            Soviet leaders have considered that they can continue to pursue their
                            present political policy, while simultaneously avoiding courses of
                            action involving high risk of general war. If they had not, they would
                            surely have provided themselves with much stronger forces than they now
                            have and would be embarked on a much steeper buildup. Instead, they are
                            building strategic forces at a pace which, while a substantial burden on
                            an already strained economy, is well below their maximum potential. This
                            in turn implies that they intend to pursue courses of action which, in
                            their view, will keep the risks of war under control. It does not
                            assure, however, that they will always estimate these risks
                            correctly.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Effect on the Soviet Outlook</hi></p>
                        <p>3. While intending to avoid war, the Soviets expect their strategic
                            strength to lend increasing weight to their foreign policies. On a
                            general <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0392"/>level, growing
                            strategic capabilities will strengthen the Soviet leaders' belief in
                            their ability to influence the course of events in all areas of the
                            world. Their sense of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                            political weight, its “right” to a voice in all international questions,
                            is closely linked to their appraisal of relative military power. As the
                            gap has grown between their own military strength and that of all other
                            countries save the US, they have increasingly insisted upon their
                            great-power prerogatives and have injected their demands into all sorts
                            of world issues. This attitude has encouraged them to pursue more
                            forward courses of action in remote areas, for example, Southeast Asia.
                            The growing capabilities estimated in <gloss target="#t_NIE1"
                                >NIE</gloss> 11-8-62 will nourish this tendency.</p>
                        <p>4. In particular issues involving a direct clash of Soviet-American
                            interests, however, more acute considerations of military risk figure in
                            Soviet calculations. The Soviets know the magnitude of Western military
                            strength. We believe that their appraisals of the implications of that
                            strength are realistic. We also think it certain that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has come to appreciate US
                            intelligence capabilities and now credits the US with a fairly accurate
                            estimate of Soviet long-range striking power. At present, the Soviets
                            estimate that each side could inflict great damage on the other, despite
                            their respective defense capabilities, and they believe that the US
                            makes the same estimate. They realize, however, that the US still has a
                            greater capability to damage Soviet territory than they do to damage US
                            territory. Unless some highly effective antimissile system alters the
                            strategic balance, or some unforeseen break-through in offensive weapons
                            occurs, we believe that they will continue to hold this judgment.<note

                                effectiveness—before the US does. A propaganda campaign is already
                                underway to persuade the world of a marked Soviet advantage in this
                                field. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>

                        <p>5. The Soviets hope—indeed they think it all but inevitable—that their
                            growing intercontinental striking power, together with their air defense
                            posture, will so inhibit US policy as to widen the scope of actions
                            which they can undertake without substantial risk of war. During most of
                            the 1950's, the Soviet deterrent consisted mainly of the threat of
                            ground and air attack, and more recently <gloss target="#t_MRBM1"
                                >MRBM</gloss>s, against Western Europe. The Soviets evidently
                            regarded this form of deterrence as insufficient because it could not be
                            applied directly against the US, and their foreign policies reflected a
                            cautious approach to the calculation of risks of war.</p>
                        <p>6. During the same period, however, they were vigorously pursuing the
                            development of new and more effective systems for attacking the <pb
                                n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0393"/>US and for protecting
                            themselves against US attack. They evidently believed that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, by posing a direct threat to the US
                            homeland, would radically increase the force of their deterrent and thus
                            permit them to undertake bolder advances with no increase of risk. By
                            late 1958, they concluded that their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss> claims, borrowing credibility from their sputnik
                            demonstrations, had begun to achieve this result. At this point, a
                            decade after the Berlin blockade, they felt themselves able to resume
                            the exploitation of the West's geographic vulnerability in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>7. Nearly four years have elapsed, and during this time the Soviet
                            leaders' expectations have sobered. They have acquired a keener
                            appreciation of the difficulties of translating gains in military power
                            into tangible political advances. During much of the period, they had
                            reason to believe that the US was overestimating their <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. Even so, they evidently did
                            not consider that the West was so deterred that they could safely
                            undertake unilateral moves against its vital interests in Berlin.</p>

                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-62 makes it clear, however,
                            that during 1958 and 1959 the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
                            fact had no <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability, and that
                            even in 1960 and 1961 this capability was quite small. But in 1962 the
                            second generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> is being
                            deployed at operational sites, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> almost certainly knows that the US knows, not only of
                            the deployment, but also the actual location of the sites. The Soviets
                            previously were willing to act only with caution on the basis of a
                            capability which they knew existed mainly in their opponents' minds, but
                            their appraisal of risks may change now that their capability has become
                            real and is growing.</p>
                        <p>9. We recognize this possibility and its hazards for the period ahead. We
                            nevertheless regard it as likely that the Soviets will not abandon
                            caution in Soviet-American confrontations, including Berlin. We believe
                            they recognize that there are severe limits to the challenges which can
                            be posed with weapons which the challenger is as concerned as the
                            opponent to avoid using. As before, when their inflated <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> claims had won considerable
                            acceptance, they will again seek to persuade the West of their
                            determination to advance. They will believe that the US ought to draw
                            the conclusion that, under these circumstances, it can no longer
                            maintain its exposed positions. They will almost certainly test Western,
                            and particularly American, reactions in order to judge whether their
                            gains in strength have had this effect. But the depth and vigor of their
                            probing will depend more upon their estimate of US reactions than on
                            their calculations of relative military strength. Accordingly they will
                            not, in our view, automatically conclude that actions which were
                            heretofore too risky have now become tolerably safe.</p>
                        <p>10. It is also important to note that the calculations of relative
                            military strength and Western reactions to probes are only part of a
                            host of factors which will affect Soviet decisions. The movement of
                            politics <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0394"/>within the <gloss

                            and the nature of opportunities for expansion which arise in the Free

                            foreign policy.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Question of Timing</hi></p>
                        <p>11. It is clear that the Soviet successes with sputniks and <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> tests in 1957-1958 had much to do
                            with inspiring the confidence which led the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> to open its challenge on the Berlin question in
                            November 1958. Beyond this general observation, we find no precise
                            relationship in timing between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>'s Berlin tactics and the progress of its buildup in
                            strategic forces. In particular, the quickening of the tempo of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program in 1961 seems unlikely
                            to have resulted from any new decisions regarding Berlin. It reflects
                            development and deployment decisions taken several years previously. The
                            fairly regular buildup of intercontinental forces projected in the
                            estimate for the next year or so does not suggest that Soviet efforts
                            are concentrated toward reaching some particular force level at any
                            particular time or in relation to any particular situation, e.g.
                            Berlin.</p>

                        <p>12. One additional implication deserves attention. The Soviet long-range
                            forces estimated in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11- 8-62 for the
                            next few years are neither as large nor as well protected as
                            corresponding US forces. In these circumstances, we believe that the
                            Soviet leaders will continue to think it highly important to make it as
                            difficult as possible for the US to acquire targeting information. This
                            in turn implies that they are unlikely to ease their basic attitude
                            toward inspection of arms control agreements. It also indicates that
                            they will continue to attach a very high priority to the countering of
                            Western reconnaissance.</p>

                        <p>1. We have examined the implications for our defense policy of changes in
                            the Soviet military posture over the next five years, as pro-jected in
                                <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-62 and other pertinent
                            national estimates. Among the changes forecast are several potentially
                            significant developments on which some new light has been shed since

                            attention and review of certain US programs. We can, however,
                            tentatively <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0395"/>conclude from our
                            examination of estimated changes in the Soviet military posture that
                            these changes, in themselves, presently call for no major alterations in
                            the US strategic retaliatory force structure which was recommended to

                            programs in areas associated with such matters as large yield weapons
                            effects, penetration aids, and satellite survivability. Our present
                            examination also reaffirms the continuing need to press ahead with
                            programs we have laid out in other fields, including civil defense, air
                            defense, and general purpose forces.</p>
                        <p>3. The Soviet forces now estimated for the period 1962-1967 are of a size
                            and character which remain within the parameters used last fall in
                            developing our own recommended strategic force mix (force levels and
                            weapons systems) for this period. Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss> forces in particular, are estimated for the period to
                            be approximately of the size previously forecast in our intelligence
                            estimates, and they remain substantially less than in the assumed high
                            and median Soviet postures used by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>

                                requirements is shown in Table 1, attached to Annex A. [Footnote in
                                the source text.]</note> The new estimates indicate that a hardening
                            program may be proceeding somewhat sooner than previously anticipated,
                            but again the total number of hardened sites forecast for the period is
                            still well below our planning assumption figures for 1965 and 1967.
                            Perhaps the principal unknown presented for our planning is the
                            influence which introduction of large yield weapons—and their number—may
                            have on future Soviet offensive and defensive capabilities. While such
                            weapons were taken into account in our force planning last fall, there
                            are still uncertainties as to some of their physical effects which must
                            be resolved before their full military implications can be
                            determined.</p>
                        <p>4. Our present re-examination of the situation in light of the latest
                            estimates of Soviet posture indicates that the objectives we have been
                            seeking through our recommended strategic forces mix and other programs
                            are still essentially valid. In brief, these objectives have been:
                            first, to provide the United States with the capability, even under
                            unfavorable <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0396"/>circumstances of
                            war outbreak, to deny the Soviet Union the prospect of military victory
                            or of knocking out the US retaliatory force, while at the same time
                            assuring prompt destruction of a high proportion of Soviet nuclear bases
                            and remaining nuclear forces; second, to retain a large protected
                            reserve force for (a) follow-on attacks against Soviet military forces,
                            (b) attacks if necessary against Soviet urban society, and (c)
                            attempting to bring the war to a negotiated end without attacks on
                            cities.</p>
                        <p>5. Our present and previous analyses recognize that even in the most
                            favorable case with restraints in targeting on both sides, civil
                            casualties in the United States and Western Europe could be on the order
                            of ten million each, while without restraints during the 1962-1967
                            period, under many circumstances of war outbreak, they could be on the
                            order of 100 million or more each. As time passes the Soviet potential
                            for doing civil damage to the West will grow; the incentive to actually
                            carry out such attack may, however, diminish.</p>
                        <p>6. The new estimates of Soviet posture do not lead us to alter our basic
                            assessment that during this time period we retain a relatively strong
                            military posture in the event of nuclear war, but that the potential
                            civil damage implications are progressively more unfavorable with the
                            passage of time. The latter, of course, applies to both sides, so that
                            the prospect of real victors emerging from any major nuclear war
                            diminishes further.</p>
                        <p>7. In addition to the problem areas given prominence by our latest
                            estimates of Soviet long-range striking forces for the 1962-1967 period,
                            there are several areas of potential significance which merit
                                attention.<note n="10" xml:id="d103fn10">In the attached Annex A

                        <p>8. The rapid Soviet development and initiation of deployment of
                            anti-ballistic missile systems require the US to counter Soviet

                        <p>9. It is our view, after examination of the Soviet military posture in
                            light of our most recent intelligence estimates, that the Soviets are
                            pursuing an essentially deterrent military strategy in which their
                            military forces are designed to: <list>

                        <p>10. Our intelligence estimates indicate an increase in the number of
                            Soviet forces capable of hitting directly at the United States in the
                            1962-67 period, as well as a general trend of larger warhead yields
                            deliverable by these forces. However, the relative US-<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> military postures during the period
                            do not significantly improve Soviet chances of launching a disarming
                            nuclear strike against us. During this period, the Soviet military
                            posture shows some improvement in surviving nuclear military forces
                            following an initial nuclear exchange, but the Soviet Union would still
                            be left in a militarily inferior position relative to the US under
                            almost all circumstances of war outbreak.<note n="12" xml:id="d103fn12"
                                >The exception would be an out-of-the blue, perfectly executed and
                                coordinated attack on our forces, without our having received any
                                strategic or tactical warning. In this case, U.S. forces surviving
                                might be limited largely to Polaris submarines and carriers at sea,
                                together with airborne alert aircraft and some hardened missiles.
                                This situation could leave neither side with a clear military
                                superiority. For a variety of reasons, this eventuality appears
                                highly improbable. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The Soviet
                            military posture also increases the Soviet ability to inflict civil
                            damage, already great for most war outbreak situations.</p>
                        <p>11. The general implication of the Soviet military posture and the
                            strategy which it supports would appear to be that the Soviets hope to
                            confront us with continuing political pressure, subversion and various
                            forms of unconventional warfare under the umbrella of their growing
                            strategic power. At the same time, they would hope to capitalize on
                            their conventional military power by the implicit threat of bringing it
                            to bear in situations where they have a local conventional superiority.
                            Thus—barring successful effort on our part to create additional
                            options—such a strategy could, at worst, leave open to us the
                            unpalatable choice of a first strike or swallowing our losses in a
                            series of confrontations at local pressure points around the periphery
                            of the Soviet Bloc. Increased Soviet <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366"
                                facs="0398"/>ability to put direct pressure on the United States
                            (through the threat of larger forces capable of hitting the US) would
                            also open us to added Soviet efforts to separate us from our Allies, and
                            to create divisions among them.</p>
                        <p>12. The broad conclusion to be drawn for our own defense policy is to
                            reaffirm the importance of shaping our military posture so as to provide
                            credible military options over a wide spectrum of contingencies from
                            nuclear war at one end to local wars and minor aggressions at the other.
                            The developments we have considered here, while not of a kind to dictate
                            basic change in our strategy and military posture, do reduce even
                            further the desirability of resort to the high end of the spectrum of
                            nuclear means and consequently increase the importance of developing
                            alternative means of bringing military power to bear around the
                            world.</p>

                            <item>The estimates contained in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                                11-8-62 of Soviet capabilities for long-range attack do not require
                                basic revisions or changes in our foreign policy as a whole. This
                                view is predicated on the expectation that the defense policies
                                outlined in Section II of this study are vigorously and effectively
                                carried out. If these policies are effectively implemented, there is
                                no reason to believe, in the period under review, that the
                                correlation of forces in any significant extent will favor the
                                Soviet Union. We can anticipate the continuance of the tensions,
                                strains, and dangers of the cold war. As Soviet strategic
                                capabilities grow the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may well
                                judge that it can press more aggressively toward limited objectives
                                without running serious risks of general war. A more aggressive
                                political action by the Soviet Union is, however, not at all
                                certain, and cannot be predicted at this time. Any such development
                                would depend upon a number of factors which, at present cannot be
                                foreseen—in particular, their estimate of relative military
                                strength, and of the Western reactions which they encounter when
                                they try to test the political potency of their strategic
                                strength.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>We judge the greatest hazard to be in the Soviet calculation (or
                                miscalculation) of the risks of particular courses of action as
                                Soviet military capabilities grow. A dangerous change in the
                                calculus of risks would of course be most likely if the Soviets
                                thought they had obtained a temporary military superiority,
                                especially in the field of AICBMs, whether or not we shared that
                                estimate. In such circumstances, the Soviets might seek to exploit a
                                temporary military advantage before the United States could redress
                                the balance. The current estimates of future Soviet military
                                strength, and current US defense programs, do not lead us to expect
                                such a situation. Nonetheless, it should be a basic task of the
                                United States, if possible, to see to it that this military
                                advantage does not occur and to this end to give the highest

                            <item>It has long appeared likely that the Soviet Union would follow the
                                United States' lead and develop a submarine missile force of some
                                strength. These forces now appear likely to be larger than was
                                previously estimated. Reasonable figures consistent with the
                                estimates in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-62 are about
                                90 submarines with some 350 missiles by 1967. This is almost double
                                the numbers forecast a year ago for 1966. (See comparison of
                                estimates and explanatory note in Table 2.)<note n="14"

                                be noted that the bulk of the increase is accounted for by cruise
                                missiles (30 submarines with 156 missiles by 1967, compared with
                                none in last year's forecast). There is uncertainty both as to the
                                eventual number of these cruise missile subs (which as estimated
                                will include many more nuclear than diesel-powered types), and their
                                intended use—whether they are intended for attack against land
                                targets as well as surface shipping. The latter presently appears to
                                be their more likely major role.</item>

                            <item>Other aspects of the changing composition of the Soviet missile
                                sub force also present difficulties in assessing the potential
                                threat this force poses. On the one hand, there is an increase in
                                the ballistic missile threat (about 60 submarines in 1967 compared
                                with 48 submarines previously forecast for 1966), and a greater
                                number of nuclear-powered submarines (about 50, compared with 24
                                submarines previously), which will increase the potential for
                                protracted stationing of these forces at sea. <pb n="368"
                                    xml:id="pg_368" facs="0400"/>Also, there are strong indications
                                that the Soviets are developing a submerged ballistic missile launch
                                capability. With missiles of ranges estimated at 650 to 2,000 miles,
                                these submarines could increase the difficulties of our <gloss

                                developed them on an operational scale. On the other hand, while the
                                Soviets are actively pursuing a submerged launch program, these
                                developments at their present stage indicate that a Polaris-type
                                threat has not yet materialized. Furthermore, the component of the
                                Soviet force which combines nuclear-powered submarines with
                                ballistic missiles shows no appreciable change from what was
                                previously estimated (25-30 submarines in 1967 compared with 24
                                submarines previously forecast for 1966).</item>

                            <item>Despite the many uncertainties which exist with respect to the
                                potential threat of the Soviet sub-launched missile force, both in
                                terms of weapons and methods of operation, it is apparent that we
                                shall have our work cut out for us in finding ways to deal with this
                                problem. In the future, as the number of nuclear-powered submarines
                                increases, the Soviets may adopt operational practices that would
                                make it very difficult to counter the sub-launched missile threat.
                                In the mid-60's, a portion of the Soviet nuclear-powered submarine

                                superior naval technology. So far, it has been possible for the
                                United States to operate submarines on station close to Soviet
                                territory while the Soviets have not done likewise. Nevertheless, if
                                the Soviets continue their technical progress, build the numbers of
                                ships estimated, and keep a substantial portion of their force on
                                station with long-range missiles (although probably a much smaller
                                proportion than we will be able to keep on station), we will be
                                presented with problems of great difficulty.</item>

                            <item>Two contrasting cases are of interest in illustrating some of the
                                problems we face. In the first, favorable to us, the Soviet
                                submarine fleet—following current practice—for the most part would
                                not be deployed at war outbreak and virtually some would be in
                                position to launch immediately against the United States. In this
                                case, we could expect our attacks on Soviet naval and submarine
                                bases (some 50 aiming points in the mid 1960's) to kill a large
                                proportion of the missile sub force. The remainder would face
                                further attrition in seeking to reach launch areas. The surviving
                                sub-launched missile threat to the United States in this optimistic
                                case would be minimal in comparison with other Soviet nuclear forces
                                that are likely to survive.</item>

                            <item>In a second and more likely case, much less favorable to us, the
                                Soviet submarine fleet would be largely deployed either on a
                                steady-state <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0401"/>basis or
                                during a crisis. The survival to time of launch of the Soviet force
                                would depend, in addition to circumstances of war outbreak, on the
                                effectiveness of our sea surveillance, tracking and sub-killing
                                systems. If the Soviets operate their nuclear submarines very
                                carefully, and especially avoid making much noise, a portion of
                                their force will probably be able to avoid detection while on
                                station within missile range of targets in the United States. On the

                                submarines on station is small, we may be able to count and to track
                                them with fair precision. If ordered to fire in a coordinated
                                attack, the Soviet missiles could undoubtedly be launched before the
                                submarines could be destroyed. However, it might be possible through
                                prompt attack to destroy many of the submarines and at least deny
                                the Soviets the prospect of retaining a highly protected reserve
                                force on station.</item>

                            <item>The Soviets might be able on occasion to put enough submarine

                                virtually no tactical warning to our soft bomber and missile bases
                                (submarine missiles are unlikely to have a combination of yield and
                                accuracy to present a major threat to hardened dispersed sites).

                                very large yield weapons may pose for our military systems, such as
                                possible vulnerability of our Minuteman LCC's to electromagnetic
                                pulse effects, it would be unwise at this time to dismiss the
                                potentially serious military implications that Soviet employment of
                                these weapons might have. For example, some recent preliminary
                                investigation suggests that the thermal effects from a 100 <gloss
                                    target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> weapon burst at very high altitude
                                over a bomber base might greatly reduce the number of bombers that
                                would survive to undertake their assigned missions, even with 15
                                minutes of <gloss target="#t_BMEWS1">BMEWS</gloss> warning.
                                Likewise, the multiple effects of large yield bursts against
                                hardened installations like a Minuteman complex might present a more
                                serious problem than previously thought. (Calculations based on
                                existing data indicate that the advantage over lower yield weapons
                                in this case is not likely to be more than 10-15%, but this is by no
                                means certain.) It must, indeed, be emphasized, that there are still
                                many uncertainties with regard to these and other examples of large
                                yield weapon effects, which can only be determined through further

                                effects may indicate, the following implications of possible Soviet
                                employment of such weapons can be drawn from our war gaming and
                                other analyses to date. First, the military outcome in the mid-60's
                                in terms of relative force survival under various circumstances of
                                war outbreak and targeting policies does not appear to be
                                appreciably affected. A major study of United States strategic force
                                requirements now scheduled for completion by 1 October 1962 will,
                                among other things, provide a reassessment of our tentative
                                conclusions on this issue. Second, while a definitive assessment of
                                the direct military advantages of using large yield weapons will
                                depend on factors not yet determinable, such weapons would certainly
                                lend themselves to a Soviet deterrent strategy with strong “terror”
                                overtones. Third, the magnitude of civil damage ensuing as a result
                                of use of large yield weapons would depend heavily on the targeting
                                strategy employed by the Soviets—military, urban-industrial, or
                                mixed. Variations in civil damage from use of high yield weapons are
                                more sensitive to the kind of targeting elected in military attack
                                cases than in urban-industrial or mixed attacks. For example,
                                assuming that 60% of the US population is afforded fall-out
                                protection consistent with our present civil defense goals for the
                                mid-60's, tentative estimates for illustrative cases in this period

                                    >PSI</gloss> or more) would begin to appear in 1965. By this
                                time, improvements in our Minuteman force will give us reasonable
                                expectation of adequate destruction capabilities against such

                                introduce these hard-category sites in greater numbers than have
                                been hitherto estimated for later 1963 and 1964, that is—before the
                                improved Minuteman becomes available. Such a development could
                                degrade our target destruction capabilities somewhat in this
                                intervening period. We could reassign some Atlas E and F and Titan I
                                and II missiles against additional hard-category sites, but this
                                would be at the cost of target coverage flexibility. The extent of
                                this potential problem is clearly sensitive to: (a) our ability to
                                meet our own operational missile schedules; (b) our criteria for

                            <item>Our latest intelligence estimates indicate that the Soviets are
                                working to improve the readiness and reaction times of their medium
                                and long-range missile units, and that they are investing in
                                measures to provide a re-fire capability. Present Soviet procedures
                                for firing initial and subsequent salvoes are relatively slow and
                                complicated, and design limitations of their current missile systems
                                appear to preclude attainment of readiness conditions approaching
                                those of US systems. Nevertheless, some improvement can be expected.
                                These trends, together with the beginning of an <gloss

                                for the Soviets to defer decision in any ambiguous situation. It
                                would also place their forces in a somewhat better posture than at
                                present for attempting to carry out preemptive and retaliatory

                            <item>With regard to Soviet refire doctrine and capabilities, several
                                points are worth noting in connection with our own planning. In
                                Soviet eyes, the size of their missile force may be regarded not in
                                terms of numbers of launchers, but launchers plus re-fire. (While
                                the evidence is not <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0405"/>firm on
                                this point, we believe an average of two missiles is provided per
                                launcher.) This could lead the Soviets to place somewhat greater
                                weight on the potential of their missile force than circumstances
                                may warrant. Our estimates indicate that Soviet time to re-fire is
                                measured in hours (perhaps 10 hours minimum for <gloss
                                    target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s, and about 4 to 6 hours for
                                    <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>'s), which means that in
                                fact, under any likely circumstances of war outbreak and with our
                                planned targeting, the bulk of Soviet launchers would not survive
                                for a second round of fire. Soviet re-load capabilities to date are
                                associated with soft sites. It is not clear whether their hardened
                                sites will be adaptable to re-fire. Should the latter prove to be
                                the case, we would, of course, want to insure that hardened sites
                                were not left to deliver further fire. Even if complete destruction
                                of a hardened site should not be attempted, a weapon detonated in
                                the vicinity could render such a site unfit for re-fire for an
                                indefinite period.</item>

                                advised to examine factors bearing on this potential problem.
                                Studies now underway in the Department of Defense are taking this

                                does not seem to offer any significant advantages to the Soviets

                                more of this highly vulnerable force will survive than if it were
                                somewhat smaller. If the Soviets strike first, they already have

                                under some intermediate circumstances, the Soviets might consider it
                                important to have the additional assurance of a larger missile force
                                posed against Europe. The pattern of deployment of this force also
                                shows that the Soviets count on it, particularly on its <gloss

                                outside the immediate area of Western Europe. This is another factor
                                which may seem to them to justify some redundancy with respect to

                                without publicity, since we stand more to gain than the Soviets by

                                this has been the attempt to design our forces and provide options
                                for their use so as to exert pressures on the Soviets to minimize
                                civil targeting in the event of nuclear conflict. As to be expected,
                                there has been conspicuous Soviet refusal (exemplified by <persName

                                damage-limiting concept. What we know of private Soviet discourse on
                                the subject, as reflected in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                                11-8-62, does not indicate that the Soviets have given much thought
                                to minimizing civil damage in a strategic exchange. Clearly, we
                                cannot count on the Soviet Union using restraint in its targeting
                                policies, even in self-interest. Nevertheless, the stakes involved
                                would seem to warrant continued effort to influence the Soviets in
                                this direction. In this connection, planning on our side to ensure a

                                among the more persuasive “educational” tools at our disposal. Our

                                of our program. As currently developed, this program calls for
                                protection of the population from the fallout threat. It offers no
                                guarantee against the blast effects of a potential attack. In the
                                mid-range period, this shelter program would be very effective in
                                saving lives in case of attacks primarily against military targets.
                                (See page 5, paragraphs 2c (1) and (3).) If attacks were launched
                                against large urban-industrial areas, there would be very large
                                numbers of fatalities in any event, although fallout shelters would
                                make a significant difference. The currently projected program
                                (about two-thirds complete in the mid-60's) would reduce total US
                                casualties, under a Soviet first strike, approximately on the

                    <p>Since World War II, the Soviets have given top priority to the maintenance of
                        undisputed military superiority over the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces in Western Europe. To this end, in recent years
                        they have given emphasis both to conventional forces (which include
                        relatively high yield tactical atomic weapons) and to medium range nuclear
                        missiles sited on Soviet soil. They continue to expand this formidable
                            <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> array, the effective

                        potent tool for the intimidation of Western Europe, particularly when the

                    <p>Vis-à-vis the United States, the Soviet position is much less secure. Soviet
                        leaders must appreciate their inferiority in certain aspects of the
                        preparations for general nuclear war, particularly in numbers of strategic
                        weapons and delivery vehicles and in early warning means. However, it is
                        clear that they are not content to live with this inferiority and intend to
                        correct it, if possible, tilting the scale in their favor and upsetting the
                        present “balance of terror.” Toward these ends, the Soviets are steadily
                        increasing their offensive strength in deployed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>'s and in missile-launching submarines, and are augmenting
                        the invulnerability of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s by
                        hardening and perhaps by concealment of launching sites. A growing
                        appreciation of the effectiveness of U.S. reconnaissance capabilities has
                        probably been a shock to Soviet leaders who may be <pb n="380"
                            xml:id="pg_380" facs="0412"/>expected to accelerate these programs in
                        order to correct the weaknesses which they know that we have detected.</p>
                    <p>The attention paid by the Soviets to the defensive aspects of general war
                        preparations is particularly notable. The effort to offset our superior
                        bomber force by a very extensive system of <gloss target="#t_SAM1"
                            >SAM</gloss> defenses has been going on for several years and still
                        continues. Recent intelligence indicates the probability of deployment of an
                        Anti-Ballistic Missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) which may have
                        already begun. Whatever we may think or say about the effectiveness of this
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, the Soviets probably feel that it
                        will pay for its cost in giving some degree of protection to Russian cities
                        and in gaining prestige abroad and morale at home. The Soviets probably hope
                        by these efforts to move from the present strategic situation where the U.S.
                        holds the balance of nuclear superiority largely through manned bombers with
                        neither side having an acceptable missile defense, to one where the U.S.
                        offensive strength against military targets is neutralized by an
                        invulnerable Russian missile force on land and sea and the Soviet homeland
                        defenses are significantly better than those of the U.S. The “balance of
                        terror” then would be tipped in favor of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                    <p>With the declining U.S. superiority in the strategic field, it is reasonable
                        to expect that the Soviets may increasingly press in Europe to gain local
                        advantages without risking general war. If, beyond this, they succeed in
                        upsetting the “balance of terror” in their favor—particularly if they beat
                        the U.S. to an effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> while the U.S.
                        remains unprotected against missile attacks—the potential limits of Soviet
                        aggressiveness are greatly extended. It is not hard to visualize as a
                        consequence a Western Europe swinging to neutralism as the precariousness of
                        the situation becomes clear.</p>

                        must take a decision without delay with regard to the deployment of
                        Nike-Zeus and accept the need to give a higher priority to the requirements

                    <head>106. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>Under date of September 1962, the paper on “U.S. Overseas Internal Defense
                        Policy” approved by the White House in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>
                        No. 182 (<ref target="#d105">Document 105</ref>) was widely distributed
                        within the U.S. Government and U.S. Missions abroad. The paper opens with an
                        analysis of Communist insurgencies that emphasizes their origin as political
                        responses to the stress of modern economic development and continues with a
                        description of stages of insurgency. The U.S. role should run the gamut from
                        “Immunization of vulnerable societies not yet seriously threatened by
                        communist subversion or insurgency” through defeat of “subversive insurgency
                        in countries actively threatened by assisting the government under attack
                        with military as well as non-military means.” One goal is to “minimize the
                        likelihood of direct U.S. military involvement in internal war by maximizing
                        indigenous capabilities” of defeating insurgency. U.S. strategy should not
                        “assume a stance against revolution, per se, as an historical means of
                        change.” Therefore non-Communist insurgency should be “examined on its
                        merits in the light of U.S. interests.”</p>
                    <p>The paper recommends land reform, civil action, community development,
                        education, cultivation of existing and emerging elites, police assistance,
                        and diplomatic suasion as preferred means of bringing about successful and
                        largely indigenous counterinsurgency efforts. “Anticipating, preventing and
                        defeating communist-directed insurgency requires a blend of civil and
                        military capabilities and actions to which each U.S. agency at the Country
                        Team level must contribute.” In countering insurgency, however, “the major
                        effort must be indigenous since insurgency is a uniquely local problem
                        involving the aspirations and allegiance of local people.”</p>
                    <p>In Washington, the paper charges the Special Group (Counter-Insurgency) with
                        assuring “a coordinated and unified approach to regional or country
                        programs,” verifying progress in their implementation, and making “decisions
                        on inter-departmental issues arising out of such programs.” The Department
                        of State is “responsible for providing overall policy guidance and assuring
                        the coordination of internal defense programs.” The Secretary of State will
                        determine whether there shall be a military assistance program for a
                        country. The Agency for International Development is responsible for
                        administering economic aid programs in support of community development and
                        civic action. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is also to strengthen the
                        capability of police and paramilitary organizations to “enforce the law and
                        maintain public order with the minimum use of force,” to “counter
                        communist-inspired or exploited subversion or insurgency,” and to encourage
                        “the development of responsible and humane police administration” and
                        judicial procedure.</p>

                    <p>The Department of Defense is assigned a wide variety of roles, such as
                        training of U.S. forces in counterinsurgency, military assistance,
                        preparation of military sections of country defense plans, and the support
                        of civilian and military counterinsurgency programs in affected countries
                        with the assistance of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        “is an active participant in the U.S. Internal Defense effort at both the
                        national and the country team levels” and its role “will be carried out in
                        accordance with the provisions of statutory authority and executive
                        direction.” The <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> “will orient its
                        programs toward immunizing the vulnerable sectors of developing societies
                        against communist propaganda and subversive activities, and helping the
                        modernization process to maturity without impairing the progressive
                        enhancement of sovereignty and national values of the recipient
                        country.”</p>
                    <p>Annex A requires the Department of Defense to “support the <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in clandestine operations assigned to that
                        agency” and to be “prepared to execute assigned paramilitary operations,
                        wholly or partly covert, which require significant numbers of militarily
                        trained personnel, amounts of military equipment, or military experience of
                        a kind and level peculiar to the Armed Services.” Annex B is a glossary of

                        <item>On strategic retaliatory forces, I think <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> has now come around to buying the arguments
                            that some of us were making last year. These arguments, however, are
                            like the different arguments he himself made last year, justifying no
                            particular numbers, and I still think it is true that he is buying more
                            in the way of missiles than we need. The real purpose of his paper is
                            more a defense against service demands for a bigger force than
                            justification of the forces he has requested. I have only one suggestion
                            as to how this observation can be translated into practical terms. This
                            goes to the buildup of Minutemen in relation to the buildup of improved
                            Minutemen (Table, p. 2). If possible, it seems to me there would be some
                            virtue in delaying the buildup from 600 to 800 Minutemen, adding 150
                            improved Minutemen to the 600-level force in 1966, and building up
                            improved Minutemen more rapidly thereafter, if this then appears
                            appropriate. I am looking into the question of how much would be saved
                            by this change in scheduling now, and what difference it would make to
                            the outcomes of the net evaluation calculations presented in the
                            Appendix.</item>

                        <item>The naval portion of the cost of general purpose forces is
                            substantial, yet there is no justification in logical terms for the
                            naval forces similar to that offered for ground and air forces. There is
                            no analysis of the relation between the kind of navy we want and the
                            kind of wars we wish to be prepared to fight. I find it hard to resist
                            the conclusion that we are maintaining 15 attack carriers by an
                            expensive replacement schedule, and that we are building 6-8 attack
                            submarines per year to maintain that force at its present size for
                            reasons that have more to do with the continuance of past programs than
                            they had to do with a sharp analysis of needs. As a horseback judgment I
                            would think that a billion dollars taken from naval general purpose
                            forces by cutting down the size of the fleet somewhat <pb n="385"
                                xml:id="pg_385" facs="0417"/>and put into increasing army and air
                            force logistic support would add to the kind of fighting capability
                            which <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is looking for.
                            Or alternatively, it might be a way to save a billion dollars.</item>

                    <p>When we came in, it was the very strong feeling of most of those connected
                        with the new Administration that the Planning Board and the Operations
                        Coordinating Board had both become rather rigid and paper-ridden
                        organizations. Neither of them seemed likely to be responsive to a new Chief
                        Executive and his principal cabinet officers. Your Secretaries of State and
                        Defense argued strongly that a more streamlined organization would be better
                        for your particular purposes, and the Secretary of State in particular
                        believed that it was most important to emphasize the operational
                        responsibility of his department, as against the rather diffuse authority of
                        staff committees without the power of decision. This impatience with much of
                        the existing staff machinery was shared by a number of advisers who had had
                        experience of it in the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                        <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0418"/>Administration—notably <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Douglas Dillon</persName>, and later <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>.</p>
                    <p>It is probably also true that we did not promptly develop fully adequate new
                        procedures of our own. The State Department has not proved to be as
                        effective an agency of executive management as we hoped, and above all it
                        has not shown the capacity for inter-departmental coordination which we
                        hoped to force upon it. This, in my judgment, is largely because neither the
                        Secretary nor the Under Secretary has taken the lead in this direction, so
                        that the burden has fallen on <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2">George
                            McGhee</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis
                            Johnson</persName>, who simply lack the necessary standing and
                        authority. Under a strong President, even more than a relatively inactive
                        one, there can be no final coordination except from the White House.</p>
                    <p>We have always had, however, rather more organization then General <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> probably recognizes. We have,
                        for example, kept in our service the most effective professional members of
                        the National Security Council staff, and we have added to them such notably
                        qualified staff officers as <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1"
                            >Forrestal</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KC2">Kaysen</persName>, and now Colonel Legere. We
                        have instituted a system of administrative follow-up on Presidential
                        decisions which works both by formal memorandum and by informal and
                        continuous communication.</p>
                    <p>We have also increased the administrative support and certain important
                        inter-departmental committees. This is notably true of the 5412 committee
                        which is run with a much better and more thorough staff process than was
                        true in January 1961, and the same applies to the Special Group for
                        Counter-Insurgency, organized under General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName>'s leadership.</p>
                    <p>The National Security Council as such has seemed to us a much too cumbersome
                        instrument for intensive use, but in the course of the recent Cuban crisis,
                        you have instituted an Executive Committee which so far has worked unusually
                        well. We are thinking of continuing the Executive Committee with a wider
                        mandate on a regular weekly basis, and it is probable that certain
                        continuing subcommittees may also be useful.</p>
                    <p>It will remain true that our operating style will be somewhat different from
                        General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s. Your own
                        instinct is to work closely with the men who are most directly concerned
                        with a particular problem, and to seek advice from a wider and more varied
                        circle than General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> used.
                        For this reason, your tendency is to use frequent small meetings with those
                        who have an immediate concern with a problem—Laos, the Congo, the Defense
                        budget, nuclear testing, Cuba, Berlin, and balance of payments. This is
                        simply the way you do your job, and I see no chance that you will want to
                        take the opposite course of reviewing the agreed papers laboriously ground
                        forward by a third-level bureaucracy and presented to you through the medium
                        of weekly meetings of 30 or 40 people.</p>

                        think that much of General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                        were more characteristic of our first few months than of your present
                        operations. I think that it may be worthwhile to emphasize both that we have
                        learned a lot in the last year and a half, and that your own staff have
                        never publicly engaged in any criticism whatever of General <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s choice of staff methods. What
                        we have said and what I, at least, have deeply believed, is that different
                        Presidents are bound to have different administrative methods. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> is a believer in a
                        military concept of staff operations, and you govern by direct personal
                        involvement and decision.</p>

                    <p>On November 20, 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff forwarded to Secretary of
                        Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> a memorandum
                            (<gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>-907-62) on his recommendations

                        (see <ref target="#d107fn3">footnote 3, Document 107</ref>). The Chiefs'
                        memorandum reads in part:</p>
                    <p>“3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have serious reservations concerning certain
                        portions of the rationale contained in the draft memorandum. It is agreed
                        that a full first-strike capability as defined in the subject paper is not
                        feasible in the time period under consideration. Neither the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff nor the Air Force recommend such a concept. Below is a quotation taken
                        from an Air Force Study, part of which was contained in the draft
                        memorandum. The underlining has been added to indicate an omitted

                        our Allies to levels acceptable in light of the circumstances and the
                        alternatives available.'</p>
                    <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0420"/>
                    <p>“4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that a first-strike capability is both
                        feasible and desirable, although the degree or level of attainment is a
                        matter of judgment and depends upon the US reaction to a changing Soviet
                        capability. They consider the definition of adequate US first-strike
                        capability to be that military power required to conduct a nuclear attack
                        against the Sino-Soviet Bloc, prior to its striking the United States, that
                        would degrade substantially the capability of the Sino-Soviet Bloc to
                        inflict damage on the United States and Free World forces, economic
                        structure, and society to the extent that the United States and its Allies
                        would emerge with a relative power advantage over the Sino-Soviet Bloc. A
                        first-strike, or a pre-emptive option, provides the United States and its
                        Allies increased latitude within the total spectrum of military
                        possibilities. It is also fundamental in maintaining the cohesion of the
                        free-world alliances. For example, a capability for pre-emption is essential
                        if the United States is to convince the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> Alliance of its determination to employ external forces
                        when such is necessary to prevent the over-running of Europe by Soviet
                        forces. A first-strike capability is a credible threat which, if employed
                        firmly and judiciously in consort with other major elements of national
                        military power, can serve to confine and prevent escalation of lesser levels
                        of conflict. In light of this, a first-strike option is required to meet our
                        military commitments and provide for guarantees already made by the United
                        States to its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies. The degree to
                        which a first-strike capability has deterred limited aggression is difficult
                        to determine since we are unable to assess Soviet behavior had the United
                        States possessed a lesser capability. The Soviets have shown restraint in
                        their actions and have carefully avoided direct commitment of Russian forces
                        to limited aggression.</p>
                    <p>“5. If the rationale presented in the draft memorandum is intended to suggest
                        that there are no circumstances in which we will initiate the use of
                        strategic forces, then we believe that we must face fully the cost of other
                        alternatives, such as matching the Soviet Union in other areas of military
                        strength, including those areas in which it now possesses a clear margin of
                        advantage. The ultimate strength of our position among the nations of the
                        Free World has resided in the realization on the part of our enemies that an
                        interest identified as vital to the United States will be defended with
                        whatever means are necessary. The ultimate level of defense rests with the
                        possession of a clear military superiority by the United States. The Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff consider that in the interest of added flexibility the
                        ability to execute a coercive strategy would be a desirable option, if
                        attainable. A coercive strategy is based on the ability to threaten such
                        great destruction of Soviet population, either after the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has expended most of its strategic
                        nuclear strength or after most of this strength has been destroyed, that the
                        Soviets would be willing to accept an end to hostilities on terms favorable
                        to the United States and its <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0421"/>Allies
                        without further strategic nuclear exchange. We recommended that the
                        desirability of such a strategy continue to be recognized as an available
                        option under pre-emptive circumstances.</p>
                    <p>“6. The force levels and composition contained in the draft memorandum, as
                        related to Minuteman and Skybolt, do not reflect the previous recommendation
                        provided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The US strategic nuclear forces as
                        shown in <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>-67 and the Skybolt program
                        have been reviewed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and are considered necessary
                        if the United States is to maintain the clear margin of superiority over its
                        potential adversaries.</p>
                    <p>“7. If the GAM-87 program is discontinued and its contribution is not
                        replaced by an equivalent capability, the result will be a substantial
                        degradation in the over-all strategic capability. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        consider that provision of 100 additional Minuteman missiles by 1968 does
                        not constitute a capability equivalent to the 1012 Skybolt missile
                        program.</p>
                    <p>“8. The cancellation of the Skybolt could have political implications since
                        the British decision to participate in the Skybolt program required the
                        British to reject the Blue Streak missile which they have developed. This
                        was a contentious and almost unprecedented departure from previous British
                        policy of using domestic resources for their aircraft programs. If the
                        British elect to continue the program on their own it could have
                        considerable impact on the other important elements of their national
                        military strength together with their <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        contribution. If they cancel their portion of the program, within the
                        context of the present agreement, an equivalent capability will be required
                        or we must accept the alternative of a further degraded capability. Perhaps
                        the most accurate measurement of the impact on the combined Allied
                        capability is contained in a recent statement from USCINCEUR concerning 1967
                        and 1968 force objectives. He recommends a force of 120 medium UK bombers,
                        72 of which would be equipped with Skybolts. The task of this bomber force
                        is to conduct operations in coordination with the US Strategic Air Command.”

                            with the views of the Chiefs, I would like to express in this memorandum
                            a differing opinion on the Skybolt air-to-ground missile program, the
                            cancellation of which is the most important single issue in your
                            memorandum.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The basic question in the Skybolt issue is how much we should pay to
                            extend the useful life of the B-52 bombers by providing penetration
                            assistance in the form of air-to-ground missiles. The argument in favor
                            of providing this assistance is the need to continue to exploit the
                            asset of the manned strategic bomber, waning though that asset be, in
                            order to superimpose its delivery capacity upon the impressive
                            megatonnage which can be delivered by our long range missiles in the
                            1968 time frame. Since the B-52s will at that time represent an
                            important part of the total potential weight of our strategic attack in
                            a retaliatory situation with warning, it would seem prudent to retain
                            this delivery system during the next few years if, by giving it
                            penetration aids, we can assure bombs on target for a significant
                            percentage of its delivery capacity.</item>

                                mentioned in paragraph 1.</note> would meet the requirements for
                            assisting the B-52s in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 by
                            providing 100 more Minuteman missiles and 172 more Hound Dogs, both
                            additions being primarily for air defense suppression in support of the
                            B-52s. The total programmed Hound Dogs would thus increase from 408 to
                            580 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968. In compensation for these
                            additions, you propose to cancel the 1012 Skybolts originally programmed
                            for 1968 with a net saving by this substitution of approximately 1.3
                            billion dollars. The question then becomes whether this is an acceptable
                            substitution or whether, as the Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated, your
                            proposed program would result in a “substantial degradation in the
                            over-all strategic capability.”</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>My conclusion is that, while the decision is a close one, the facts as
                            I know them do not establish a compelling case for the judgment of the
                                <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0423"/>Chiefs cited above. This
                            conclusion rests upon the following considerations.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>While the B-52 bomber fleet is still important during the next few
                            years in contributing to our deterrent posture, the target system left
                            to attack by bombers after penetration tends to decline in importance as
                            missiles take over the most important targets which require attack with
                            minimum delay. Hence, the price paid for the penetration of the B-52s
                            should not be too high. Furthermore, the penetration aids bought should
                            become available quickly or they will not have concurrent availability
                            with the useful remaining life of the B-52s.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>In this respect, I am impressed with the danger that the Skybolt
                            program with its present test difficulties which it must overcome would
                            arrive too late to contribute long to the usefulness of the B-52s. Even
                            if kept upon schedule, the Skybolt will not be available in numbers
                            before 1966 and it is difficult to foresee much use for the B-52s in the
                            1970 era. With a little slippage in the Skybolt program, we would have
                            an expensive auxiliary weapon system which, like <gloss
                                target="#t_BOMARC1">BOMARC</gloss>, arrived too late to perform a
                            remunerative mission.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Assuming that we concede the need of reinforcing the penetration
                            capability of the B-52s, is it necessary to go for a new and complicated
                            system such as Skybolt? This question raises the matter of relative
                            capabilities of Hound Dog and of Skybolt, a matter about which the
                            experts disagree. My over-all impression is that the advantages
                            attributed to Skybolt are not sufficiently impressive to provide a clear
                            margin of superiority over Hound Dog if supplemented by other
                            penetration aids. If-52s with Hound Dog are preceded with an adequate
                            number of Minuteman missiles provided for air defense suppression, and
                            if maximum effort is put on <gloss target="#t_ECM1">ECM</gloss> in
                            support of the B-52s, it would seem to me that the over-all
                            penetrability of the force would be comparable to that which may be
                            obtained from a successful Skybolt program.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>My lukewarmness for spending any substantial sum for a new standoff
                            missile for the B-52s results from my own doubt as to the long-term
                            effectiveness of the manned bomber in the strategic mission. Henceforth,
                            in the missile age, all aircraft on the ground will be highly vulnerable
                            to surprise attack and the B-52s are no exception. Under conditions of
                            surprise attack, they are unlikely to make a significant contribution to
                            our over-all strategic effort. In the other extreme case, a U.S.
                            preemptive attack, the B-52 forces will not be necessary to add to the
                            destruction of the enemy, which can be accomplished in large measures by
                            other means. Only in the case of U.S. retaliation after receiving
                            tactical warning does it appear that the B-52 mission may be an
                            important one. In this situation, the Skybolt could be a valuable
                            weapon, although how much better than the combination of the Hound Dog
                            plus Minuteman is difficult to say.</item>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0424"/>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>In conclusion, although the choice is a narrow one, I would support
                            the cancellation of the Skybolt program and the addition of Minuteman
                            missiles and Hound Dogs to compensate therefor. Because of the
                            uncertainty of the size and nature of the air suppression target system
                            to be struck, I do not have a feel for the adequacy of the numbers which
                            you suggest, namely 100 more Minuteman missiles and 172 more Hound Dogs.
                            My over-all judgment on the Skybolt issues results from a conviction of
                            the over-all redundancy of our nuclear strategic strike capability to
                            deter the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or to attack those
                            targets which must be struck to destroy or to cripple the enemy. I am
                            also impressed with the greater priority of need for other important
                            programs which compete for our resources, such as the antimissile
                            missile program, the program for the modernization and increase of
                            conventional forces, and projects to increase the reliability and the
                            penetrability of our long-range missiles. Even if the decision is taken
                            to continue the Skybolt program, I should like to be assured that these
                            more important programs receive the weight of fiscal support necessary
                            for their success, before making provision for a relatively marginal
                            program such as Skybolt.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>In 1961, the Army proposed full development of the Nike-Zeus and deployment
                        of the system for the defense of 27 cities. The development program
                        recommended by the Army was approved but, because of <pb n="393"
                            xml:id="pg_393" facs="0425"/>limitations in the effectiveness of the
                        system, deployment of Nike-Zeus was disapproved. Congress appropriated $384
                        million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 for ballistic missile
                        defense development, including $274 million for Nike-Zeus.</p>
                    <p>During the past year we have gained a much broader understanding of the
                        problems of ballistic missile defense, the level of defense that may be
                        achieved, and the characteristics of the most effective system. The
                        technical opportunities offered by alternatives to or modifications of
                        Nike-Zeus were thoroughly examined by the Army. This effort led to the
                        initial design of four major improvements: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                                missile would increase the time available for discrimination.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Development of a new phased array radar; this radar could
                                simultaneously acquire, evaluate, and track a large number of
                                objects.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The addition of (1.) and (2.) above to the Nike-Zeus yields Improved Nike
                        Zeus. Nike Zeus Improved plus (3.) and (4.) provide Nike Zeus Augmented A
                        and Nike Zeus Augmented B respectively. A system based on (3.) and (4.)
                        (plus some small number of Zeus missiles) is Nike-X.</p>
                    <p>New programs are now proposed to incorporate these developments. Our
                        currently approved program, the new Army proposal, and my recommendation for
                        the future are briefly summarized below.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Current Approved Program</hi></p>
                    <p>Continue development and tests of the Nike-Zeus system and limited
                        development of the phased array radar. Development costs for this program
                        for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 through <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1967 total $600 million. Initial deployment of this system,
                        if it appeared worthwhile, could begin within four years of the time a
                        deployment decision is made.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Proposed Army Program</hi></p>
                    <p>Develop both the Improved and Augmented Nike-Zeus systems and the Nike-X
                        system. Sixteen Zeus batteries for twelve urban areas would be deployed
                        beginning in 1967. Ten Nike-X batteries, for ten additional urban areas,
                        would be deployed beginning in 1969. Sprint missiles and array radars would
                        also be added to the first 16 batteries, and the Zeus missiles would be
                        redistributed over all 26 batteries. Development costs for this program,
                        beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963, would total $1.4 billion, and
                        the initial costs for a 26 battery defense would total around $12.2 billion.
                        The twenty-two urban areas around which these batteries would be deployed
                        include approximately 30 percent of our population.</p>
                    <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0426"/>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Recommended Program</hi></p>
                    <p>Develop fully only the Nike-X system. (The Nike-Zeus test program would be
                        reduced below the currently approved level and would be limited to the study
                        of re-entry phenomena and defense techniques, including anti-satellite
                        defense.) Development costs for this program, beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1963, would total around $1.3 billion. A decision to deploy
                        the Nike-X system would be deferred until mid-1964. The first Nike-X
                        batteries could be deployed in 1969 and a 26 battery defense could be
                        completed three or four years later. The initial costs for a 26 battery
                        defense would total around $11.7 billion.</p>
                    <p>The estimated costs of the Current Program, the Proposed Army Program, and my
                        Recommended Program are summarized in Table 1.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows Table 1.]</p>
                    <p>The program recommended by the Army to begin deployment of a composite system
                        incorporating the Improved and Augmented Nike-Zeus systems instead of the
                        Nike-X development (and possible deployment) does not seem to me to provide
                        an interim defense capability which is worth the minimum of $2.7 billion
                        additional which it requires. This interim deployment proposal has the
                        additional undesirable effect of providing, at completion of deployment, a
                        heterogeneous system of somewhat lower quality than Nike-X. It also commits
                        us at this time to the deployment of a ballistic missile defense system,
                        which my recommendation does not. Without being convinced that the Nike-X
                        system should eventually be deployed, I recommend that we proceed vigorously
                        with its development on a schedule which will preserve the option of the
                        earliest possible deployment.</p>
                    <p>The rationale for these recommendations is briefly summarized below: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The proposed Army program represents a substantial improvement
                                over the Nike Zeus. The final Army system is almost as good as
                                Nike-X against various types of determined attacks. However, in its
                                early stages the Army deployment is a marginal effectiveness due to
                                its limited target handling capability. Even in the final deployment
                                the vulnerability of parts of the Army system to modest blast
                                effects and the lower traffic handling capability make it somewhat
                                inferior. The major arguments for the Improved/Augmented system are
                                its earlier availability and the insurance it provides against
                                unexpected problems in developing an advanced system.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Nike-X system promises a sufficient capability to insure a
                                more equal contest with offensive weapons and tactics. A Nike-X
                                defense would probably still cost more than the cost of offensive
                                weapons which could overcome this defense; such a defense, however,
                                would significantly reduce the damage from any given number of
                                weapons targeted against our cities. For the same deployment cost,
                                Nike -X will provide <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0427"/>a more
                                effective system than the Army's program, although the first units
                                would be delayed two years.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The recommended program will make a potentially satisfactory
                                deployment option available at the earliest possible time without a
                                current financial commitment for procurement planning.</item>

                            development expenditures even if the probability of deployment is rather

                        Chief of Naval Operations support the program proposed by the Secretary of
                        the Army; they understood, however, that the Army program would cost only
                        $380 million more than my recommended program instead of around $3 billion
                        more. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force recommends that the Nike -X and
                        Nike -Zeus research and development programs and Nike-Zeus tests should be
                        conducted, but that a decision should not be taken at this time to begin
                        deployment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff supports the views of
                        the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations.</p>

                    <p>The comments of the Joint Chiefs of Staff describe a number of the strategic
                        considerations associated with a decision to deploy a ballistic missile
                        defense. A broader range of strategic and economic considerations, together
                        with the technical situation at the time, will determine whether such a
                        defense should eventually be deployed. These additional arguments for
                        deployment of a less than perfect ballistic missile defense are also
                        pertinent: <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0429"/>

                            <item>A ballistic missile defense of limited capability would contribute
                                to the deterrence of large attacks by raising doubt about the
                                attacker's ability to penetrate. Such a defense, even though
                                limited, greatly complicates the design and tactics for offensive
                                weapons. The Soviets may not pursue an extensive penetration aids
                                program even though it is in their interest to do so; if penetration
                                aids are developed, the total yield of an attack would be
                                considerably degraded by the weight penalty.</item>

                            <item>A ballistic missile defense system with the effectiveness of
                                Nike-X would significantly reduce the damage from a given number of
                                weapons directed against our urban areas. Only a small proportion of
                                the Soviet missiles may be used for an attack on urban targets in a
                                general war in which either we or they initiate a counter-force
                                strike.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>On the opposite side of the issue, the following additional arguments are
                        relevant: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>Deployment of a ballistic missile defense would almost surely
                                provoke a Soviet reaction. This reaction could be a penetration aids
                                program, an increase in the number of missiles, or the deployment of
                                very large yield weapons. The nature and scale of their response
                                depends, in large part, on the cost of the actions necessary to
                                overcome our defense. Some idea of their response can be gained from
                                our own experience. The cost of our penetration aids program will be
                                less than one-fifth the cost of a ballistic missile defense system
                                and the lead time for improved penetration aids is substantially
                                shorter. The incremental cost of the number of missiles required to
                                overcome a good ballistic missile defense would be from one-tenth to
                                one-half the cost of the defense. We cannot be sure the Soviets
                                would respond on a scale necessary to overcome our defense, but the
                                economic advantage is definitely in favor of the offense.</item>

                            <item>The value of a defense against a relatively small missile force in
                                the hands of a minor power has been noted. Minor powers, however,
                                could still threaten cities with a population of around one million
                                that are not defended.<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4">In a November 10

                                    would be inadequate to deal with the anticipated threat,” and
                                    recommended that it not be deployed “in its present form.” The

                                    concept” gave promise for the future, and that one using phased

                    <p>After a careful evaluation of the GAM-87 (Skybolt), and for reasons that I
                        shall make clear later in this memorandum, I recommend the cancellation of
                        the program. This action will result in savings of $568 million in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 and of about $2.5 billion over the
                        period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963-<gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1968, of which about $600 million is for warheads and $1.9
                        billion is for Skybolt development and production. Further, as a partial
                        offset to this reduction, I recommend approval of 100 additional Improved
                        Minutemen by end-<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I recommend that we adopt, for planning purposes, the force
                        structure summarized in the following table. Where they differ from my
                        recommendations, the forces proposed by the Services are shown beneath mine
                        in parentheses.</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>Over the five years, 1964-1968, the complete cost to buy and operate the
                        aircraft and missiles recommended by the Air Force and the Polaris
                        recommended by the Navy exceeds the cost of the forces I am recommending by
                        approximately $12.5 billion, of which about $5 billion is for the RS-70.
                        (The Air Force plan would entail additional costs for the RS-70 in later
                        years.) As will be shown later in this paper, the extra capability provided
                        by the individual Service proposals runs up against strongly diminishing
                        returns and yields very little in terms of extra target destruction. In my
                        judgment, it is an increment not worth the cost of $12.5 billion over the
                        five year period.</p>
                    <p>The forces I am recommending differ from the recommendations of the Joint
                        Chiefs in the following respects. First, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> have stated a requirement for an additional 100 operational
                        Minutemen by end-<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965. The costs of such
                        an increase in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 and <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 would amount to approximately $500
                        million. Second, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommend a force
                        of 1,200 Minutemen by end-<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967. (My
                        recommended force reaches 1,150 by that time.) Third, the Chiefs of Staff of
                        the Army and Air Force, and the Chief of Naval Operations, recommend that
                        the Skybolt program be continued as proposed by the Air Force.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d112fn2">See <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> The

                        recommendation to cancel this program.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d110">Document 110</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>As well as these forces, I recommend that we continue development and
                        procurement of the Post-Attack Command and Control System (<gloss
                            target="#t_PACCS1">PACCS</gloss>) airborne system and initiation of
                        construction of a Deep Underground Survivable Center. The airborne system
                        consists of 17 airborne command posts (<gloss target="#t_ABNCP1"
                            >ABNCP</gloss>'s) and 36 B-47 communications relay aircraft. To date, 12
                        KC-135A command post aircraft are in place and one is maintained
                        continuously airborne. All 17 <gloss target="#t_ABNCP1">ABNCP</gloss>'s are
                        scheduled to be in place by June of 1963 and the relay aircraft by May 1963.
                        The KC-135B <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0434"/><gloss
                            target="#t_ABNCP1">ABNCP</gloss>'s with improved communications will be
                        in place at the end of 1964. The approved investment costs for the airborne
                        system are $162 million (plus $26 million R&amp;D), with a level-off annual
                        operating cost of $36.5 million. Additional funds will be needed as
                        continued improvements to communications and command center capability
                        evolve.</p>
                    <p>I recommend initiation of construction for a Deep Underground Command Post
                        for <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1964. This would be operational in 1967-1969 and would provide a highly
                        survivable, long-endurance center for post-strike control. The initial cost
                        is estimated to be on the order of $155 million.</p>
                    <p>The following sections describe in greater detail the basis for my
                        recommendations, by reviewing, first, strategic objectives, the Soviet-Bloc
                        nuclear threat and our target destruction capabilities, general nuclear war
                        outcomes, and second, the particular key decisions to be made this year.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. General Basis for Force Level
                            Recommendations</hi></p>
                    <p>In order to provide a firm basis for determining the capabilities of
                        Strategic Retaliatory Forces in general nuclear war missions, I asked the
                        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to establish a Special Studies Group
                        which would have, as one of its tasks, to examine strategic objectives and
                        force requirements on a continuing basis. This Group analyzed the
                        comparative capabilities of alternative strategic forces for the 1968
                        period. These studies, in addition to other studies by the Services and my
                        staff, supplemented the advice of the Joint Chiefs and, together with that
                        advice, provided the basis for my recommendations.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">General Nuclear War Objectives</hi></p>
                    <p>The forces I am recommending have been chosen, primarily, to satisfy two
                        requirements. They are, first, to provide the United States with a secure,
                        protected retaliatory force able to survive any attack within enemy
                        capabilities and capable of striking back and destroying Soviet urban
                        society, if necessary, in a controlled and deliberate way; and, second, to
                        deny the enemy the prospect of achieving a military victory by attacking our
                        forces. The forces I am recommending should thereby give any rational Soviet
                        decisionmaker the strongest possible incentives to avoid a nuclear attack on
                        ourselves or our allies.</p>
                    <p>However, I recognize that despite our possession of a most powerful
                        deterrent, nuclear war may break out in an accidental or unpremeditated way,
                        or as the consequence of enemy irrationality or miscalculation. Therefore, I
                        believe that we should take all measures that offer a reasonable prospect of
                        effectively limiting damage to ourselves and our allies in the event that
                        deterrence fails and thermonuclear war does occur. Such measures include
                        active anti-bomber and anti-missile defenses and civil defenses. Strategic
                        offensive forces can also make an important contribution <pb n="403"
                            xml:id="pg_403" facs="0435"/>by striking back against Soviet bomber
                        bases, missile sites, and other vulnerable elements of Soviet follow-on
                        forces. In some circumstances, our counterattack may succeed in blunting the
                        Soviet attack and make a substantial contribution to the damage-limiting
                        objectives. The forces and program I am recommending meet this
                        requirement.</p>
                    <p>It has become clear to me that the Air Force proposals, both for the RS-70
                        and for the rest of their Strategic Retaliatory Forces are based on the
                        objective of achieving a first-strike capability. In the words of an Air
                        Force report to me:</p>
                    <p>“The Air Force has rather supported the development of forces which provide
                        the United States a first-strike capability credible to the Soviet Union, as
                        well as to our Allies, by virtue of our ability to limit damage to the
                        United States and our Allies to levels acceptable in light of the
                        circumstances and the alternatives available.”<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4"
                            >The source of the quotation is not identified. In the memorandum cited
                            in <ref target="#d112fn3">footnote 3</ref> above, the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> denied favoring a first strike
                            capability in the sense of protecting the United States completely from
                            serious consequences. But they did want the United States to retain a
                            relative power over the “Sino-Soviet Bloc,” and stated that a preemptive
                            option would provide “increased latitude within the total spectrum of
                            military possibilities.”</note></p>
                    <p>Of course, any force designed primarily for a controlled second-strike, and
                        for the limiting of damage to the U.S. and its Allies, will inevitably have
                        in it to an important degree a first-strike capability. What is at issue
                        here is whether our forces should be augmented beyond what I am recommending
                        in an attempt to achieve a capability to start a thermonuclear war in which
                        the resulting damage to ourselves and our Allies could be considered
                        acceptable on some reasonable definition of the term.</p>

                            xml:id="d112fn5"><ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note> I defined
                        a “full first-strike capability” as a capability that “would be achieved if
                        our forces were so large and so effective, in relation to those of the
                        Soviet Union, that we would be able to attack and reduce Soviet retaliatory
                        power to the point at which it could not cause severe damage to U.S.
                        population and industry.” I indicated then and I reaffirm now my belief that
                        the “full first-strike capability”—and I now include the Air Force's variant
                        of it—should be rejected as a U.S. policy objective. This is for several
                        reasons.</p>
                    <p>a. It is almost certainly infeasible.</p>
                    <p>By this I mean that the same means for achieving a secure, protected
                        retaliatory force able to survive any attack and be capable of striking back
                        that we are using are also available to the Soviets. In particular, I was
                        recently informed by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> that the Soviet
                        Union now has a submarine-launched ballistic missile (<gloss
                            target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>) capability which, if unopposed, would
                        permit deployment of nearly 100 missiles against <gloss target="#t_CONUS1"
                            >CONUS</gloss>. The Soviets <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0436"
                        />also have submarine-launched cruise missiles. The <gloss target="#t_NIE1"
                            >NIE</gloss> now estimates<note n="6" xml:id="d112fn6">The <gloss
                                target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> has not been identified.</note> that by
                        mid-1967, the Soviets will have some 186 <gloss target="#t_SLBM1"
                            >SLBM</gloss>'s and 156 cruise missiles. Although we have an effective
                        capability to sink enemy submarines in a protracted war at sea, we have no
                        realistic prospect of being able to destroy a major part of deployed enemy
                            <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss> forces in a sudden attack, thereby
                        preventing Soviet retaliation after a U.S. attack. Moreover, like ourselves,
                        the Soviets can harden their land-based missiles. Recent intelligence
                        indicates that they are beginning to harden both their <gloss
                            target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>'s and their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>'s. They have the further option of protecting these forces
                        with active ballistic missile defenses, a choice which appears uneconomic to
                        us, but which may be attractive to them. There is a problem of uncertainty
                        of location of some of their missile sites. Furthermore, I am convinced that
                        we would not be able to achieve tactical surprise, especially in the kinds
                        of crisis circumstances in which a first-strike capability might be
                        relevant. Thus, the Soviets would be able to launch some of their
                        retaliatory forces before we had destroyed their bases.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it is clear to me that the forces proposed by the Air Force itself
                        cannot give us this capability. For example, in mid-1968, under very
                        favorable circumstances, the Air Force proposed force would at best be able
                        to reduce Soviet strategic forces to roughly 100 surviving ICBM's (for
                        example, assume that we locate and target about 93 per cent of a force of
                        700 missiles and destroy in time about 93 per cent of the missiles we
                        target). In addition, approximately 100 submarine-launched missiles could be
                        at sea. If these remaining forces were targeted against U.S. cities, they
                        could inflict roughly 50 million direct fatalities in the United States,
                        even with fallout protection. I do not consider this an “acceptable” level
                        of damage.</p>
                    <p>I have said <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> certainly infeasible because I can
                        think of at least two reasons why it might not prove to be infeasible.
                        First, the Soviets could blunder and leave themselves vulnerable to a U.S.
                        first-strike. I do not consider this to be a very likely possibility. As I
                        indicated earlier, already the Soviets are deploying <gloss
                            target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>'s and hardened <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>'s and <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>'s. Moreover,
                        even if they were to be so foolish as to leave themselves vulnerable to a
                        U.S. first-strike, because of the presence of diminishing returns in target
                        destruction, the extra forces proposed by the Air Force do not appear to add
                        a great deal. The possible circumstances in which the Air Force proposed
                        forces would provide the U.S. with a good first-strike capability and those
                        proposed by me would not seem unclear and improbable.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, one might argue that we could hope to achieve a satisfactory
                        outcome by combining a good first-strike capability with a coercive
                        strategy. That is, we might try to knock out most of the Soviet strategic
                            <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0437"/>nuclear forces, while keeping
                        Russian cities intact, and then coerce the Soviets into avoiding our cities
                        (by the threat of controlled reprisal) and accepting our peace terms. In
                        this case we would be counting on our ability to destroy their will, not
                        their ability, to destroy our cities. I believe that the coercive strategy
                        is a sensible and desirable option to have in second-strike circumstances in
                        which we are trying to make the best of a bad situation. There the only
                        justification it requires is a reasonable possibility that it might work.
                        But it would be foolish to count on it working to the point that it would
                        form the basis for a belief that we could strike first without retaliation.
                        Moreover, there are limits to the extent to which extra strategic
                        retaliatory forces help in these circumstances once we have a protected
                        capability to destroy essentially all of their urban society.</p>
                    <p>b. It is neither necessary nor particularly useful.</p>
                    <p>The threat of U.S. first-strike has long since been shown to be ineffective
                        in deterring limited provocations and aggression. Therefore, it has been
                        necessary to build up our theatre forces at levels at which they would be
                        adequate to meet our commitments without resort to nuclear weapons. We have
                        made a great deal of progress toward this objective in the past two years,
                        and we plan further progress.</p>
                    <p>c. It would be extremely costly.</p>
                    <p>A “full” or “credible” first-strike capability, even if feasible, would cost
                        much more than the costs of the Air Force proposed Strategic Retaliatory
                        Forces. As well as much larger and more effective Strategic Retaliatory
                        Forces, such a capability would require very large expenditures on Civil
                        Defense and Continental Air and Missile Defenses.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, the following discussion is limited to evaluation of the
                        recommended and alternative forces in second-strike conditions. Although I
                        examine the capability of these forces to destroy Soviet military targets in
                        a second-strike, I want to make it clear that an ability to destroy 100 per
                        cent of these targets is not one that I think we can possibly attain.
                        Rather, I believe that we should stop augmenting our forces for this purpose
                        when the extra capability the increments offer is small in relation to the
                        extra costs.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="superscript">a</hi> Intelligence recently received indicates that
                        the Soviets are not hardening their <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>
                        launchers.</p>
                    <p>The principal defensive weapon systems that the Soviets are estimated to have
                        deployed in the 1966-1968 period are:</p>
                    <p>(1) SA-2;</p>
                    <p>(2) SA-3;</p>
                    <p>(3) fighter interceptors for anti-bomber defense; and,</p>
                    <p>(4) anti-missile defense system against an <gloss target="#t_MRBM1"
                            >MRBM</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat.</p>
                    <p>The present generation Soviet ground-to-air missile, the SA-2, is similar to
                        the U.S. Nike-Hercules. We expect the Soviets to have deployed about 600
                        SA-2 batteries in 1966-1968. This system has a good capability against
                        bombers at moderate altitudes, but its low altitude capability is minimal.
                        An improved SA-2 may have an intercept capability against high-altitude
                        non-ballistic air-to-surface missiles. This system is also estimated to have
                        some minimal capability against tactical missiles launched 50-150 miles
                        away. Some of the improved SA-2's may be configured for mobile
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>The SA-3, Hawk type system, is estimated to be designed to intercept
                        low-altitude penetrators (including high speed low-altitude ASM's). We
                        expect roughly 400-800 SA-3 batteries to be deployed in 1968.</p>

                    <p>The current generation Soviet interceptors have airborne intercept radars
                        with track/search ranges much smaller than comparable U.S. fighters.
                        Improvements are expected when advanced all-weather interceptors are phased
                        into the operational inventory. The Soviet fighter system is dependent on
                        ground controlled intercept radar for terminal vectoring to targets. Like
                        our own, the ground direction centers are vulnerable to ballistic missile
                        attack. The effectiveness of Soviet interceptors against air-launched
                        missiles, and to a lesser extent against bombers, is expected to be small,
                        not because of terminal performance considerations, but because of the
                        difficulties encountered by interceptors in acquiring targets within a
                        degraded ground environment.</p>

                            >MRBM</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> system, designated
                        the AM-1, that is believed to be effective against ballistic missiles
                        launched from 300-1000 n.mi. It is believed that the Soviets are currently
                        deploying this system around Leningrad and future deployment is possible in
                        the 1963-1964 time period. The system may be made transportable. The AM-1 is
                        considered capable, under favorable conditions, of engaging an <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> re-entry vehicle. However, the capability
                        of the AM-1 does not seem sufficient to warrant deployment to targets
                        threatened only by the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are also believed to be making a major effort to develop a single
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, designated AM-2, for defense
                        of the “homeland” against all strategic ballistic missile threats, <gloss
                            target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>'s, <gloss target="#t_ALBM1"
                        >ALBM</gloss>'s, and <gloss target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss>'s, as well as
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s. This system could probably be
                        initially deployed some time in the 1965-1966 time period. For purposes of
                        the calculations which follow, we have assumed 20 <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                            >ABM</gloss> batteries deployed in 1968.</p>
                    <p>The following table shows a projected Soviet-Bloc target list for end-<gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968. The list is based on the one used by
                        the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Special Studies Group for their
                        Strategic Nuclear Study, but includes the high projection of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> for the number of Soviet missile
                        launchers. The numbers of weapons assigned to these targets are the numbers
                        used in the calculations summarized later in this memorandum. They can be
                        taken as an approximate expression of the way in which the numbers of
                        weapons in the forces I am recommending (Force I) and the forces the
                        Services propose (Force II) might be allocated to targets.<note n="8"

                    <p>Using the high and moderate urgency Soviet-Bloc target list and the
                        operational factors shown in the Appendix, the expected target destruction
                        capabilities of the alternative Strategic Retaliatory Forces were derived
                        for a controlled retaliatory mission for the 1968 period. The effectiveness
                        of the U.S. second-strike missile attack was developed for the varying
                        Soviet-Bloc threat and is shown as the “quick kill” capability of the force
                        considered. The effectiveness of the follow-on manned bomber attack was also
                        developed and the combined target destruction capabilities of the total
                        force is shown as “ultimate kill” capability. Because the <pb n="409"
                            xml:id="pg_409" facs="0441"/>bombers are dependent on warning and alert
                        response for their survival, differentiating the destruction capabilities in
                        this manner allows the comparison of the effectiveness of the U.S.
                        second-strike under conditions of “tactical warning” and “inadequate
                        warning.” For the mid-1968 period, 295 Polaris missiles and 54 Titan II
                        missiles were held as a protected reserve for possible attacks against
                        Soviet-Bloc urban-industrial areas.</p>
                    <p>The second-strike effectiveness of attacks against Soviet-Bloc strategic
                        military targets by the Recommended and Service proposed strategic forces is
                        shown in the table below. The results are shown for the median Soviet-Bloc
                        target structure and median operational factors for the U.S. forces. For
                        both forces, the Improved Minuteman was assumed to utilize its retargeting
                        capability based on “good guidance” indicators. The effects of varying the
                        assumptions about the number of targets and the U.S. operational factors are
                        shown in similar tables in the Appendix.</p>

                    <p>The discussion of general nuclear war outcomes in mid-1968 will be limited to
                        wars initiated by the Soviet Union, and to the median assumptions. The
                        outcomes are measured in civilian and industrial damage, and in reserve and
                        recoverable forces surviving the first exchange. Two Soviet attack
                        strategies are considered: first, a counter-military attack in <pb n="410"
                            xml:id="pg_410" facs="0442"/>which only weapons targeted against

                        urban-industrial attack in which weapons are ground burst. Results of this
                        analysis are summarized below. In both years, existence of an improvised

                    <p>The Air Force has proposed, in its revised program submission, the
                        procurement of 22 squadrons (46 total and 32 alert missiles per squadron) of
                        Skybolt to be operational by end-<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967. By
                        the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965, 4 squadrons of Skybolt
                        could be operational. There has been slippage both in the estimated time and
                        costs required to complete this program. The R&amp;D costs, originally
                        estimated to be a small fraction of that amount, are now estimated to be
                        $492.6 million, and there is reason to believe that further increases are
                        likely. In the six month period (February 1962 submission to June 1962
                        submission) the total estimated procurement costs increased from $1,426.4
                        million to $1,771.0 million, an increase of 24 per cent.<note n="9"

                            text.]</note> I have felt for some time now that Skybolt was a
                        questionable program.</p>
                    <p>The Skybolt system combines the disadvantages of the bomber with those of the
                        missile. Being associated with the bombers, it shares their vulnerability on
                        the ground and their slow over-all time-to-target. The vulnerability of our
                        bomber force remains a problem. The sudden appearance in Cuba of ballistic
                        missiles capable of reaching all <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases
                        with flight time so short as to make tactical warning based on detection of
                        missile launchings practically unusable, and the recent appearance of a
                        Soviet trawler, with a previous history of cable cutting, over our <gloss
                            target="#t_BMEWS1">BMEWS</gloss> cables, has underlined once again the
                        undesirability of dependence on the tactical warning plus alert response
                        mechanism for the protection of our strategic forces. But the Skybolt does
                        not share the advantages of the bomber. Rather, it has the inaccuracy and
                        relatively low payload characteristic of missiles. That is, it has the
                        disadvantages of missiles without their advantages (quick time-to-target
                        plus protection through hardening and dispersal or continuous peacetime
                        mobility).</p>
                    <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0444"/>
                    <p>The value of Sykbolt is to be found primarily in the defense suppression
                        role. Skybolt is not a good choice as a weapon system for attacking high
                        priority military targets because it takes hours to reach its targets and is
                        vulnerable on the ground. It is not a good choice for counter-city
                        retaliation because of the low survival potential in the wartime environment
                        of the bombers that carry it, and the fact that they have to be committed to
                        attack, if at all, early in the war. However, for defense suppression,
                        Skybolt would be a good choice if it had a substantial cost advantage over
                        other systems that might do that mission. But the recent and continuing
                        slippages in that program have called that advantage into question.</p>
                    <p>The number of defense suppression targets that it will be necessary to attack
                        to allow penetration of our bombers in the later 1960's is uncertain.
                        Various studies have been done suggesting numbers between 100 and 300. Of
                        course, there is an upper limit to the number it makes sense to attack. For
                        example, if it were necessary to destroy 300 targets in order to permit the
                        bombers to penetrate and destroy 500 other targets, the question would
                        naturally arise as to whether it wouldn't make more sense to direct the
                        whole effort at the destruction of the 500 “primary” targets themselves.
                        Defense suppression can price itself out of the market.</p>
                    <p>However, suppose the number is about 300. If we go ahead with Skybolt, by
                        mid-1967, we would have about 976 air-launched missiles on alert (272 Hound
                        Dog and 704 Skybolt), at a remaining development and procurement cost of
                        about $1.9 billion. This would enable us to program two air-launched
                        missiles at each defense suppression target and still have 376 left over for
                        other low priority military targets.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, if we cancel Skybolt, by making maximum use of existing
                        resources, we can retain about 400 Hound Dogs on alert. I believe that these
                        400 missiles plus 100 extra Minutemen can do the defense suppression job
                        satisfactorily, and that the other air-launched missiles are not required.
                        This would permit the assignment of either two Hound Dogs or one Minuteman
                        to each of the 300 targets.<note n="10" xml:id="d112fn10">In the memorandum
                            cited in <ref target="#d3">footnote 3</ref> above, the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> argued that 400 Hound Dogs and 100
                            Minutemen were not equal to the previously projected 1,012
                            Skybolts.</note> The total initial investment cost of the 100 extra
                        Minutemen will be approximately $500 million. There is concern that the
                        recent announcement of the U.K. decision to phase-out the Thor weapon system
                        has increased the British dependence on Skybolt. There has been no official
                        commitment for Skybolt by the U.K., and their expenditures on the system so
                        far have been very small. The U.K. has initially stated, for planning
                        purposes, a requirement for about 180 missiles for their Vulcan bomber
                        force. This requirement has recently been reduced to 100 missiles. For the
                        British, a deployment of other weapon systems could take the place of
                        Skybolt, <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0445"/>achieving the same
                        deterrent at a lower cost than maintaining their bomber force. The
                        possibility of providing alternative nuclear forces is under study.</p>
                    <p>One of the most frequently used arguments for Skybolt is that “it extends the
                        usefulness of the manned bomber.” In the sense that, by doing defense
                        suppression it permits the bombers to penetrate, the argument is correct;
                        but Skybolt is by no means unique in this role. As I have just indicated,
                        this task can be performed satisfactorily at much less cost in other ways.
                        But in any other sense, I believe the argument is wrong. The appropriate
                        objective for the design of our strategic retaliatory force is to be able to
                        destroy the required number of targets at a minimum cost; it is not to
                        prolong the lives of particular weapon systems beyond the point at which
                        their continued operation is no longer compatible with that objective.</p>

                    <p>The Air Force has proposed an Improved Minuteman which would be phased into

                        Improved Minuteman is to have approximately twice the yield and half the

                    <p>The Navy has proposed the development of a Polaris A-3A missile. The proposed
                        program would have 368 A-3A missiles and 288 A-3 missiles in submarines by
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 at an additional cost of $1.6
                        billion. The A-3 missile has approximately 300 lbs. available for decoys;
                        the A-3A has approximately 920 lbs. available for decoys at the same ranges.
                        Although I believe that further development of a more advanced Polaris
                        missile may be desirable, I do not believe that the extra capabilities
                        offered by the A-3 missile, by comparison with the A-3, are worth the cost
                        of development and procurement. Therefore, I recommend that the Navy
                        proposal be disapproved.</p>

                                    >FBM</gloss>) conversions now assigned in the Polaris fleet
                                would be returned to the General Purpose Forces upon the entrance
                                into the force structure of the last two new construction AK(<gloss
                                    target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss>)'s.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The Navy justifies the new construction AK's on the basis that they would
                        have the capability of loading missiles (in calm waters) directly into
                            <gloss target="#t_SSBN1">SSBN</gloss>'s. The converted AK's cannot do
                        this. Currently, only the tenders are capable of storing and loading
                        missiles. The rationale for this is that the tenders would, with high
                        probability, be destroyed in a nuclear attack. In this event, surviving
                        Polaris boats could rendezvous at predesignated locations with surviving
                        AK's for missile reloading.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that repricing of the <gloss target="#t_SSBN1">SSBN</gloss>'s and
                        the proposal to defer construction of one AS(<gloss target="#t_FBM1"
                            >FBM</gloss>) be approved. I further recommend that the AK(<gloss
                            target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss>) conversion for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1964 be approved at a cost of $8.5 million, but that the
                        proposed program for new construction AK(<gloss target="#t_FBM1"
                        >FBM</gloss>)'s be disapproved. In lieu of these four new construction
                        ships, the two converted AK(<gloss target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss>)'s currently
                        in the fleet should be retained in this use, and two additional AK(<gloss
                            target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss>) conversions should be scheduled, one each
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 and <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1966 at a total cost of $17 million. Because of the
                        uncertainty as to the number of AK(<gloss target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss>)'s
                        that would survive a nuclear attack, and the fact that the reload capability
                        would not come into being until <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967-1970,
                        by which time large numbers of Minutemen missiles will be available, I do
                        not believe that the reload capability provided by the new construction
                            AK(<gloss target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss>)'s is worth the extra cost.
                        Moreover, a program of conversions rather than new construction will permit
                        the required force of six AK(<gloss target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss>)'s to be
                        achieved one year earlier, which will bring it into phase with the rest of
                        the <gloss target="#t_FBM1">FBM</gloss> force structure.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the shipbuilding costs of $131 million, the Navy proposal
                        would require an expenditure of about $234 million for reload missiles.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bob</hi>: I greatly appreciated having the
                        opportunity to review the series of memoranda which you have prepared for
                        the President of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘64 (and forward)
                        Defense Programs. The quality of these memoranda is most impressive and I
                        think the forces, which implementation of the proposals contained therein
                        would produce, are generally consistent with our basic national security
                        policy. In particular, I wish to underline the point which you make in the
                        memorandum on General Purpose Forces<note n="1" xml:id="d114fn1">For the
                            final version of this memorandum, see <ref target="#d115">Document

                        troubled parts of the world.</p>

                    <p>I also note that the study of forces required for non-nuclear defense in
                        Europe was predicated on defense of the Rhine.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2"
                            >This discussion occurs in the section of “US Non-Nuclear Force
                            Requirements Worldwide,” which also notes that “the Joint Chiefs believe
                            that military strategy must be based on containing the enemy well
                            forward, placing his forces in jeopardy, and assuming an early
                            counter-offensive, rather than allowing him to take a sizeable amount of
                            territory that can be used as a fait accompli in any pause
                            negotiations.” This language paraphrases part of a September 30

                        defense of the Central Front is under way. I think this is a point well
                        worth mentioning to the President since it could presumably support the need
                        for a subsequent adjustment in General Purpose Force requirements.</p>
                    <p>Of all of the highly important matters touched upon in your memoranda, to my
                        mind the issue which stands out above all others is that relating to the
                        question of the advisability of deploying an anti-ballistic missile defense.
                        One can only be impressed by the technical complexity of the problem.
                        However, what seems to emerge in this discussion is that a system, having
                        considerable operational uncertainties but, nevertheless, promising
                        significant defensive capabilities under certain conditions, could be
                        deployed beginning as early as 1967, were the decision made at this time to
                        do so. Obviously your technical review, which I gather includes a heavy
                        emphasis on alternative trade-off advantages as between investment in
                        ballistic missile defense and competing weapon systems, inclines you to
                        recommend against a decision to deploy at this time. I gather, however, that
                        this is by no means a black and white issue and, in fact, may represent a
                        rather close balance.</p>
                    <p>I would have no independent judgment on the technical feasibility/cost
                        consideration factors. If, however, these have led to a negative decision,
                        but only in close balance, then I would think that the decision warrants
                        further review in light of the immense political and psychological
                        implications for our entire security posture over the next decade of a
                        negative decision on deployment. Though undoubtedly taken into account in
                        your decision, the extent to which these implications were weighed is not
                        clear from your memorandum. For that reason, I have set out in a separate
                        enclosure to this letter my own views as to the significance which I attach
                        to the development and deployment by the US of an anti-ballistic missile
                        system in the shorter, rather than the longer, time period. It is my feeling
                        that if such a system, having a reasonable degree of technological
                        effectiveness can be deployed beginning as early as 1967, we should
                        carefully consider the advisability of doing so.</p>

                    <p>Since this is a matter of highest importance, you undoubtedly contemplate it
                        as a principal item for discussion with the President. I am prepared to
                        enter into such discussions whenever the President deems it appropriate.</p>

                            <item>If the Soviet Union were to deploy an anti-ballistic missile
                                defense system substantially before the United States, such an
                                action could adversely affect the current delicate world power
                                equilibrium and seriously impair the effectiveness with which the US
                                would be able to pursue its national security policy. The basis for
                                this conclusion will be developed in the succeeding
                                paragraphs.</item>

                            <item><p>In order to explain the basis for the preceding conclusion, it
                                    is necessary to clarify a few assumptions which we make.</p>
                                <p>We accept the obvious fact that any system of ballistic missile
                                    defense which we might choose to develop and deploy is at this
                                    point in time fraught with great uncertainties and immense
                                    technical complexities. From the memorandum prepared by the
                                    Secretary of Defense to the President,<note n="5"

                                        111</ref>.</note> we would gather that of the two possible
                                    systems, Nike Zeus or Nike X, the latter has greater
                                    potentialities than the former. Both, however, would seem to
                                    embody considerable uncertainties, with perhaps Nike X being
                                    more uncertain if only because it is a newer concept having been
                                    subjected to a lesser degree of research and development. In any
                                    event, however, accepting the current best estimates of system
                                    limitations and reliabilities, we would gather that there is a
                                    good likelihood that an anti-ballistic missile system could be
                                    developed and deployed having a considerable degree of military
                                    effectiveness under certain <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419"

                                    that deployment of 26 batteries might result in survival of as
                                    much as 30 to 40% of our population and production

                            <item>Proceeding from the foregoing, with full recognition of all
                                existing uncertainties, if such a system could be deployed, even
                                accepting its operational limitations, it could have an immense
                                impact on our relations with (a) the Soviets and (b) our
                                Allies.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>We do not ignore the significance of the tremendous cost
                                implication. But this is a matter which must be placed in the
                                perspective of the value of what it is we are buying. In this
                                connection, we think we need to re-look at, and perhaps somewhat
                                alter our thinking about, the military exchange ratio problem. It
                                seems to us in considering the value of this weapon system to US
                                security, we must go well beyond the weighing of the technical
                                advantages and disadvantages of investment in alternative weapon
                                systems. Though it is difficult, if not impossible, to precisely
                                quantify, we must introduce political and psychological
                                considerations which will weigh so heavily over the future decade.
                                This is particularly significant in terms of the ability of the US
                                to mobilize public will, both within the US and amongst our Allies,
                                to accept the risks inherent in living in a world of such sharply
                                competing ideologies. Thus, while we appreciate the logic which lies
                                behind the thought that the procurement of offensive ballistic
                                weapons may for sometime to come continue to be far less expensive
                                than procurement of an adequate ballistic missile defense system,
                                this is clearly not the whole story. The essential issue is whether
                                the availability of such a system to the Soviets at a time when the
                                West does not have an equal capability will adversely affect the
                                willingness and, therefore, in a very real sense, the capability of
                                the Western Alliance to effectively contest with the Communists. Or
                                to put the question in another and more positive way, whether the
                                availability of a system to the West, even one having admitted
                                technological limitations, will support and, conceivably, even
                                greatly strengthen our willingness to accept difficult, costly and
                                dangerous undertakings so necessary if we are to preserve and
                                succeed in the contest with the Communists.</item>

                            <item>From the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> memorandum it would
                                appear that the Soviets are now in process of deploying an
                                anti-ballistic missile system around Leningrad. While this program
                                may be limited in its present capabilities, we gather that we have
                                no full understanding of its present capabilities or of its ultimate
                                potentialities. It does, however, seem significant that with a
                                stringency on resources which in any real sense is greater than that
                                under which the US labors, the Soviets have chosen to make the
                                beginning which presumably could, if they project and expand their
                                present effort, result in a sizeable Soviet deployment over the next
                                several years. The Soviets are notable for their determination to
                                make military undertakings serve a political end. It would be
                                surprising if their policy in connection <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420"

                            <item>The danger, of course, is that the deployment by the Soviets of an
                                anti-ballistic missile system, during a period when our own
                                defensive posture did not involve such an undertaking, could result
                                in a serious unbalancing of the present power structure, an effort
                                which the Soviets have desperately been trying to accomplish even at
                                the expense of such a risky undertaking as the recent Cuban
                                experience. The change in power balance could occur either because
                                (a) the Soviet system as actually developed proved to be better than
                                we now predict and even conceivably better than the performance
                                which we attribute to our own system (a possibility which however
                                unlikely cannot be overlooked), or (b) because even if the system,
                                in fact, is not as technologically excellent as the preceding
                                assumptions suggest, the Soviets may over-estimate its importance
                                and attempt to use it as a part of a grand political ploy designed
                                to achieve through political means what might not be attainable
                                through actual military means. Either of these two reasons might
                                support a Soviet policy far more active and belligerent than would
                                otherwise be the case. This is not something to be accepted with
                                equanimity.</item>

                            <item>At the same time, the effect upon our Allies, especially in
                                Europe, of a Soviet attainment of <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                                    >ABM</gloss> defense in the absence of an equal Western effort,
                                must be carefully assessed. It seems entirely likely that the
                                psychological and political impact would be immense, if not
                                immediately, then ultimately, on peoples living under the daily
                                threat of a massive attack as have our European Allies. Presumably
                                the adverse impact can to some extent be mitigated by explaining the
                                limitations of the Soviet system and pointing up our own immense
                                offensive capabilities (the offense-defense trade argument), but
                                this is unlikely to carry the day. It is well worth remembering,
                                that to the people living under the threat of a massive nuclear
                                missile attack, the fact that it may be sounder economics to buy
                                more offensive missiles than defensive ones, will be vitiated if not
                                entirely lost when it is recognized that only defensive missiles
                                offer the possibility of saving lives.</item>

                            <item>In view of the foregoing, it is necessary that we consider not
                                only how important it is that we make a decision to deploy an
                                anti-ballistic missile system, but that we also consider the
                                importance of an earlier, rather than a later, deployment. Were the
                                factor of cost not so heavy the answer would be self-evident, viz.,
                                that we should proceed with all speed to deploy the first reasonably
                                technically adequate system which is available, namely the Nike
                                Zeus. However, the cost factor is important and in this connection
                                we are struck by the following factors: <list>
                                    <label>a.</label>
                                    <item>That the cost differential between the Nike Zeus and the
                                        Nike X, while significant, is not overwhelming. I gather
                                        that the former system would cost a total of 15% more than
                                        the latter.</item>

                                    <item>That the deployment of the Zeus would apparently not
                                        represent a total waste in the sense that the Nike X would
                                        be built upon and would in some measure be a logical
                                        extension of the Nike Zeus. If this is true, this would seem
                                        to me a factor of very great significance. To some extent,
                                        especially from the political point of view, it would appear
                                        that here is a case where we may be able to have at least
                                        some of our cake and eat it too.</item>

                                    <item>If, as is undoubtedly the case, the Nike Zeus has
                                        uncertainties as to its performance, presumably the Nike X
                                        must be considered a system of even greater uncertainly. If
                                        we understand correctly the normal evolution of weapon
                                        systems, they invariably demonstrate problems as they move
                                        from development through production, problems which are
                                        never fully predictable in advance. The further away from
                                        completion of development and from initial production, the
                                        greater are the uncertainties likely to be. By this standard
                                        one might question whether reliance upon the Nike X might
                                        not result in even further delay in achieving actual
                                        deployment than the two years beyond Nike Zeus estimated for
                                        this system's availability.</item>

                            <item>Consideration of all of the foregoing factors as they bear upon
                                the conduct of our national security policy over the next several
                                years, gives rise to concern over the prospect of a Soviet
                                deployment of an anti-ballistic missile system in the absence of a
                                similar US action. Even if each of the systems have some
                                technological limitations as the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                                studies contemplate to be the case, the political and psychological
                                impact of having, or not having, a system to offset that of the
                                Soviets, would be immense. Thus, even if the Sputniks had no
                                military significance whatsoever, the mere fact that the Soviets
                                were able to orbit their vessel in space before we were, created a
                                serious liability under which we labored for sometime and under
                                which we still labor to some extent even today. Indeed in such
                                circumstances the tendency of the US is to try to overcome lost time
                                through an accelerated effort which may not always result in the
                                most economical use of funds and which can never fully regain lost
                                political ground. This is a prospect which cannot be ignored when
                                considering the anti-ballistic missile problem. It is possible that
                                with the availability to the Soviets of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                                    >ABM</gloss> defense the political and psychological pressures
                                will become so great that we will have no alternative other than to
                                launch an emergency deployment of a system having thereby sacrificed
                                the opportunity to gain a favorable impact through an earlier
                                voluntary undertaking and at the same time having to accept what may
                                be a less economical solution to the problem.</item>

                            <item>There is one last aspect to the problem which, so far as we are
                                aware, has not received any prior consideration. This has to do with
                                the possibility and utility of considering the eventual extension of
                                an anti-ballistic missile system to Europe. As previously indicated,
                                as Soviet <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0454"/>capabilities in
                                this field are developed and begin to grow, the pressures upon our
                                European Allies to have a missile defense will mount. The political
                                pressure within the countries will unquestionably be reflected in
                                the make-up of governments and in the manner and extent to which
                                governments can function effectively in support of policies which
                                the US believes important. Even if we are ourselves convinced of the
                                limitations of a ballistic missile defense it is the advantages and
                                virtues of such a system which the Europeans will emphasize. As with
                                the problem of the lack of European knowledge about nuclear weapons
                                and the effects of their employment which now plagues us in our
                                efforts to gain a common strategic concept with our Allies, so too a
                                failure to hold open the promise of a ballistic missile defense may
                                have an analogous effect. While the tremendous cost involved will
                                always represent a practical inhibition to active European interests
                                in this area, we do not think we can exclude or downgrade that
                                interest solely on those grounds. To the contrary, particularly if
                                the US were to encourage the notion that a considerable degree of
                                defense could be bought through deployment of an anti-ballistic
                                missile system, it seems not improbable that the Europeans might
                                well be inclined to invest considerable resources to this end. We
                                recognize, of course, that to some extent this could be
                                counter-productive insofar as it drains away European resources from
                                other defense expenditures, which, from our point of view, we would
                                prefer to see them make. It might, however, have a contrary effect
                                by draining away resources from low priority defense programs.
                                Whether we like it or not, however, the pressures are quite likely
                                to exist. Either we will be able to satisfy them at least to some
                                extent, or we will have to pay the possible serious political price
                                of not being able to meet what the Europeans will probably consider
                                to be a legitimate requirement.</item>

                                that in the case of simultaneous, large-scale attacks, the US would
                                be faced with a choice <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0457"

                                primarily with the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                countries rather than with a major increase in US forces. Although
                                the political obstacles loom large, and many of the deficiencies
                                require considerable time to overcome, I think we can demonstrate to
                                our Allies that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                non-nuclear inferiority stems from specific remediable deficiencies.
                                The Chiefs state that until adequate forces are available, <gloss

                                through increased quantities and improved quality of equipment and
                                through reallocations from the more marginal units to those that

                        at the start of combat to provide additional divisions and non-divisional
                        units to meet the requirements of sustained combat and to reconstitute the
                        strategic reserve. The situations in the study represent major actions of

                    <p>The studies we have carried out are subject, of course, to a considerable
                        margin of error. In contrast to Strategic Forces, for which relatively
                        precise analysis is possible, the General Purpose Forces must be evaluated
                        for a broad range of situations, none of which can be specified with much
                        exactness. Intelligence data for enemy non-nuclear capabilities are of a
                        lower quality than for nuclear forces. Finally the results are highly
                        sensitive to estimates of the quantity and quality of the allied
                        contribution. Nonetheless, I think the study by the Chairman's Working
                        Group, together with the parallel studies carried out by the Army Staff, are
                        as authoritative with respect to ground divisions as the uncertainties of
                        the problem now permit. We will be conducting further studies on
                        requirements and this question will be under my continuing review.</p>

                            area.” He noted that the “effectiveness of Army forces is increased by
                            their deployment well forward—implementing a forward strategy, deterring
                            overt aggression, motivating allies, and in position to accomplish

                                other hand, the usefulness of additional <gloss target="#t_CONUS1"
                                    >CONUS</gloss> divisions is limited by lift capabilities,
                                particularly prior to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 when
                                substantial numbers of highly productive C-141 aircraft are in the
                                lift forces. Since the lift limitations are in moving equipment
                                rather than personnel, it would be preferable to preposition
                                divisional sets of equipment in Southeast Asia. As discussed below,
                                we already have equipment prepositioned in Okinawa and are making
                                provision for floating depots.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>I have now substantially completed my review of the Department of Defense
                        budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964. This review was conducted
                        jointly with the Bureau of the Budget, and I have discussed all outstanding
                        issues with the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. As shown on Table
                            1,<note n="1" xml:id="d116fn1">Tables 1-12 were not found.</note> I am
                        recommending new obligation authority for Military Functions, Military
                        Assistance, and Civil Defense of $54.4 billion compared with $51.3 billion
                        appropriated by the Congress for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963,
                        $49.4 billion appropriated for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 after
                        your three budget amendments for that year, and $43.1 billion in the budget
                        presented by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962. We estimate that the
                        expenditures in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 corresponding to this
                        amount of new obligational authority will be $53.1 billion compared with
                        $50.1 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963. Over $1.5 billion
                        of the increase in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 expenditures
                        results from increases in rates of compensation.</p>
                    <p>The forces supported by this budget are summarized in Tables 2 through 12. I
                        have explained my position on the major issues affecting these forces in my
                        earlier memoranda on: Strategic Retaliatory Forces; the B-70 Program;
                        Ballistic Missile Defense; and the General Purpose Forces (tactical ground,
                        sea, and air forces).<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">See <ref target="#d112"

                                target="#d115">Document 115</ref>.</note> The recommended force
                        structure was based on requirements for national security and was not
                        limited by arbitrary budget ceilings. In my review of the budgets proposed
                        by the Services, I have attempted, as last year, to eliminate all
                        non-essential, marginal, and postponable expenditures with the objective of
                        minimizing the cost of supporting the required forces. In total I have
                        reduced the Service proposals by approximately $13 billion.</p>
                    <p>In developing the program and reviewing the budget proposals, I have had the
                        continuing counsel and assistance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Although the
                        force structure does not include all the forces recommended by each of the
                        Services or by the Joint Chiefs of Staff collectively, the Joint Chiefs
                        agree that the program supported by this budget will further increase our
                        combat effectiveness and provide powerful forces in a <pb n="429"

                            certain reservations, particularly as regards the rate of modernization
                            and the growth in combat effectiveness of certain US forces in relation

                                    <item>What is the total number of Minuteman missiles that we
                                        should plan for in our Five-Year Force Structure and
                                        Financial Program? I have recommended a total program of
                                        1300 to be completed by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                                        substantially less than 1300, it is doubtful that the

                                        <p>I was informed by the Air Force on November 30 that a
                                            cost over-run of approximately $400 million is now

                        <item>As considered in this estimate, the components of the Soviet theater
                            forces include: the ground forces and their weapons; tactical aircraft

                            The roles and capabilities of those Soviet forces which would perform

                        <item>In recent years, Soviets have debated at greater depth than in the
                            past the probable nature of a general nuclear conflict between the Bloc
                            and the West, and the information available to us reflects this
                            increased attention. In this estimate, particularly in Chapters I and
                            IV, we consider mainly the employment of Soviet theater forces in
                            general nuclear war, taking some account of the way in which Soviet
                            plans might be affected if operations were begun on short notice, or
                            after a period of preparation. In Chapter V, we consider at much shorter
                            length the possible employment of these forces in limited nuclear or
                            conventional warfare under the threat of escalation.</item>

                        <item>It should be emphasized that, in discussing Soviet theater forces and
                            their capabilities, we do not take account of the actions of opposing
                            Western forces. In particular, we do not assess the effect of Soviet
                            theater forces of an initial, strategic nuclear exchange. We believe,
                            however, that the effect of such an exchange could be a principal factor
                            governing the ability of Soviet theater forces to carry out their
                            assigned missions in a general war.</item>

                            the estimate gives insufficent attention to the Soviet military
                            doctrine. This doctrine is said to emphasize that nuclear weapons would
                            play the dominant role in all phases of general war and to lay great
                            stress on surprise and preemption. “No doctrine of limited war, whether
                            nuclear or nonnuclear, has been discussed.”]</note></p>

                        <item>Soviet military doctrine for general nuclear war stresses the use of
                            all types of forces, and not strategic forces alone, from the outset of
                            hostilities. The requirements for general nuclear war, as the Soviets
                            see them, include forces prepared for action during a relatively brief
                            strategic exchange, and forces suitable for protracted theater warfare
                            involving extensive campaigns. Although this position imposes heavy
                            demands on Soviet resources, it is still being sustained after extensive
                            debate within the political and military leadership. We believe that for
                            at least the next few years the Soviets will continue to regard large
                            theater forces as essential. (Paras. 1-5)</item>

                        <item>Soviet doctrine continues to assume the full-scale employment of
                            theater forces from the outset of a general war, with the ultimate
                            objective of annihilating enemy military capabilities and occupying
                            territory. The prospect of nuclear warfare has led to many modifications
                            but no radical revisions in operational doctrine for theater forces.
                            Efforts are <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0465"/>being made to
                            adjust organization and training to the requirements of rapid advance
                            and flexible maneuver, to coordinate the employment of tactical nuclear
                            support for Soviet forces, and to ensure destruction of the comparable
                            nuclear means of the enemy. The traditional Soviet concept of combined
                            arms operations has provided a basis for gearing modernized tactical air
                            and missile support to the motorized and armored ground forces. (Paras.

                        <item>The ground elements of Soviet theater forces, containing nearly two
                            million men and representing the largest part of the total military
                            establishment, are well-trained and equipped with excellent materiel.
                            Present trends point to a continuing emphasis on firepower and mobility.
                            We estimate that there are about 145 line divisions, approximately 80 of
                            them considered to be combat ready and the remainder at low and cadre
                            strength. The strongest concentrations are in East Germany and in the
                            western and southern border regions of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. If the Soviets were able to mobilize for 30 days
                            before the initiation of hostilities, they could expand their total
                            forces to about 100 combat ready and 125 nonready divisions, although
                            there would be deficiencies in training, equipment, and supporting
                            units. (Paras. 13-16, 46-49)</item>

                            Soviet theater commands. Tactical Aviation has been sharply reduced in
                            quantity, and a prime current deficiency is the small number of modern
                            aircraft, particularly fighter bombers. However, there have been
                            qualitative improvements in aircraft and their armament, and this trend
                            will continue. In addition, tactical ballistic and antiaircraft missiles
                            are now available, and theater support could also be afforded by <gloss

                            support theater forces in the event of general war, but at the expense
                            of some flexibility. (Paras. 17-21)</item>

                            it has improved markedly over the past few years. Soviet military
                            planners are now in a position to think in terms of committing up to a
                            few hundred nuclear weapons virtually all with yields in the kiloton

                            probably developing subkiloton weapons, but we have no present evidence
                            of work on delivery systems designed specifically for such weapons. We
                            believe that chemical warfare munitions are available in quantity and
                            would be used extensively in conjunction with nuclear and conventional
                            weapons in general war. (Paras. 25-27, 45)</item>

                        <item>Although tactical nuclear delivery systems are integral to Soviet
                            theater forces, the nuclear weapons themselves do not appear to be in
                            their custody. Such weapons are normally stored in depots operated by
                            the Ministry of Defense and located within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                            ensure the national leadership that they will not be used without
                            authorization. Existing procedures, together with deficiencies in
                            logistical support, appear to penalize the Soviets in terms of
                            operational readiness and rapid response for tactical nuclear weapons
                            employment. (Paras. 22-24)</item>

                        <item>The Soviets probably consider the East European Satellite forces to a

                            effectiveness and reliability. In the event of war, however, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably employ some Satellite
                            forces in combined combat operations, by integrating selected Satellite
                            divisions, corps, or even field armies directly into major Soviet
                            commands. Other Satellite units would be retained under national command
                            for security, reserve, and other functions. (Paras. 36-37, 41-42)</item>

                        <item>The principal operations of Soviet theater forces in general war would
                            be directed against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in Europe. The
                            Soviets plan to move massive forces rapidly toward the Channel coast in
                            the initial days of such a war. This campaign would probably be
                            augmented by operations in Scandinavia, operations toward the
                            Mediterranean, and operations toward the exits of the Baltic and Black
                            Seas. The Soviet submarine fleet would contribute to the campaign
                            against Western Europe by interdiction operations against the highly
                            important Atlantic supply lines. Other peripheral areas, notably the Far
                            East, apparently have lesser priority for theater force operations.
                            Soviet capabilities to conduct theater force operations against North
                            America are limited to minor airborne and amphibious attacks against
                            Alaska and other Arctic bases. (Paras. 44, 59)</item>

                        <item>Although Soviet theater forces are formidable, especially in the area
                            facing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in Europe, they continue to
                            have certain limitations beyond those of tactical nuclear support. In
                            the initial period of a general war, a significant portion of the
                            tactical fighters would need to be assigned to interceptor as well as to
                            ground attack missions. In offensive operations, the highly mechanized
                            group forces are in constant danger of outrunning their logistic
                            support. Finally, existing command and control systems do not permit the
                            Soviets to exercise their traditional strict <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435"
                                facs="0467"/>supervision over subordinates in the widely extended
                            deployment requirement on the nuclear battlefield. (Para. 45)</item>

                        <item>The Soviets currently have 22 line divisions and 1,200 tactical
                            aircraft stationed in East Germany and Poland. In a situation in which
                            surprise or pre-emption were overriding considerations, they could
                            launch an attack against Western Europe without prior buildup. If
                            circumstances permitted, however, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> would seek to assemble a considerably larger striking
                            force, primarily of Soviet but probably including some Satellite units.
                            This force could comprise three fronts with a total of 50-60 divisions
                            and 2,000 tactical aircraft. We estimate that under non-combat
                            conditions, such a striking force could be built up in East Germany and
                            western Czechoslovakia within 30 days, and a theater reserve could be
                            provided for backup. The ability of these and other Soviet theater
                            forces to carry out their assigned general war campaigns could be
                            governed principally by the effects of the initial nuclear exchange.

                        <item>The adjustments in Soviet theater forces in the past few years have
                            not materially impaired their capabilities to conduct nonnuclear
                            operations. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s highly
                            mechanized forces have favorable characteristics for the dispersed
                            operations required because of the constant possibility of escalation to
                            nuclear warfare. Over the past two years, the nonnuclear firepower of
                            ground units has not been significantly altered, but the supporting
                            nonnuclear firepower which can be delivered by tactical aircraft has
                            decreased. There are indications that the Soviets have recently given
                            recognition to the possibility of nonnuclear war with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in Europe. They probably

                            revised their expectation that any major conflict with <gloss

                        <item>The Soviets have evidently not elaborated any doctrine for limited

                            conduct such warfare at present. Moreover, thus far the Soviets appear

                            understanding of the entirety of national objectives and policies which
                            relate to national security. Fragmentation of the <gloss

                            submission to the President well might lead to a dilution of the
                            essential inter-relationship of the various elements of national
                            policy—political, economic, and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            consider that a completely balanced version of <gloss target="#t_BNSP1"

                            background necessary to an adequate understanding of the policies upon
                            which military planning and implementing actions must be based.</item>

                        <item>With respect to the military implications of certain expressions of
                            policy in the draft document, dated 2 August 1962, the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff consider, inter alia, that implementation of our national strategy
                            requires an over-all military capability adequate to respond
                            effectively, together with our Allies, to the present and foreseeable
                            enemy threat in all of its various forms and intensities. This combined
                            military capability must cover the full spectrum of force, and must be
                            able not only to prevent the enemy from attaining his goals, but also to
                            accomplish other related US objectives to force a conclusion of
                            hostilities on terms advantageous<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">Rather

                        <item>In more specific terms, US military forces must be capable of
                            conducting operations employing strategic nuclear, tactical nuclear, and
                            conventional weapons. Strategic nuclear capabilities required for
                            general war, in which the total resources of the nation are committed,
                            do not of themselves preclude a concurrent military requirement for
                            adequate capabilities to employ appropriate nuclear weapons in the
                            lesser circumstances of limited war. US forces should not be foreclosed
                            by policy from developing, possessing, and, if necessary employing
                            weapons which permit the application of optional levels of force
                            depending on the circumstances. Present and forecast Soviet capabilities
                            to employ tactical nuclear weapons render more urgent the necessity of
                            clarifying this aspect of US policy.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen:</p>
                    <p>I appreciate the opportunity to make some remarks today on the relationship
                        among Alliance strategy, defense budgets and military force, and to submit
                        for your consideration some suggestions as to how we might proceed to obtain
                        a more effective common defense. Despite the great strides made during the
                        past thirteen years, we are in some danger of letting our strategic
                        concepts, forces, and defense budgets get out of touch with international
                        and technological developments. I would like to suggest, therefore, that the
                        Alliance take a fresh and comprehensive look at the threats we are likely to
                        face, at the ways we might meet them, at the forces we should have, and at
                        the funds that we should allocate to procure and support those forces.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">War in the Nuclear age</hi></p>
                    <p>For the greater part of its history <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has
                        concentrated on the threat of a massive Soviet invasion of Western Europe.
                        Although General Norstad introduced as early as 1957 the idea that a Soviet
                        attack might be limited, and proposed enforcing a “pause” to counter it, we
                        have tended too much to fix our strategy, our budgets, and our forces on the
                        threat as originally conceived in 1949. I doubt that we have drawn the full
                        implication of the maturing nuclear age on the evolving nature of the
                        dangers facing us.</p>
                    <p>In wars prior to the advent of nuclear weapons, damage was reparable and
                        victory attainable. But after a full nuclear exchange such as the Soviet
                        Bloc and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance are now able to
                        carry out, the fatalities might well exceed 150,000,000. As I observed at
                            Athens,<note n="1" xml:id="d120fn1">See <ref target="#d82">Document
                                82</ref>.</note> such damage is not certain—but it is probable. In
                        such a situation the devastation would be complete and victory a meaningless
                        term. Responsible political and military leaders are constantly aware of
                        this reality of the nuclear age.</p>
                    <p>Even during the years when the West possessed a virtual nuclear monopoly,
                        that nuclear superiority did not serve as a universal deterrent against all
                        forms of Communist political and military aggression. Still less does it do
                        so today, and even less can we count on it to do so in the <pb n="440"
                            xml:id="pg_440" facs="0472"/>future. This is not to say that nuclear
                        weapons will never be used, but that this use becomes rational only when the
                        alternative would be even worse than nuclear war; for example, a surrender
                        to Communist aggression. We in the West must maintain nuclear forces so
                        large as to preclude such a possibility and to deter the first use of
                        nuclear weapons by our opponents. But it is becoming increasingly clear that
                        such forces by themselves will not prevent less violent acts of political
                        and military aggression. If the Alliance's foreign policies are to rest on
                        military power which can be used in political and military crises of less
                        intensity than those involving the very survival of one or more of its
                        members, then that military power must include effective non-nuclear forces
                        and the ability to concentrate that power where it is most needed.</p>
                    <p>The Cuban experience is consistent with this view. During the Cuban crisis,
                        Soviet nuclear power was in effect neutralized by U.S. nuclear power. In the
                        Caribbean area, the United States had superior non-nuclear land, sea and air
                        forces which were quite capable of destroying the Soviet missiles. The
                        Soviet Union's non-nuclear forces in the area were inferior. Since the
                        controversy between the United States and the Soviet Union was not over the
                        issue of Soviet national survival, the Soviet Union was not prepared to use
                        its nuclear power. And it had no other force it could effectively use. We
                        faced a challenge which forced us to support diplomacy with military action;
                        in this action military and diplomatic moves were meshed; there was an
                        effort on both sides to localize the confrontation. And, perhaps, most
                        significantly, the forces that were the cutting edge of action were the
                        non-nuclear ones. Nuclear force was not irrelevant but it was in the
                        background. Non-nuclear forces were our sword, our nuclear forces were our
                        shield.</p>
                    <p>The situation in Europe is of course very different. Nevertheless, the
                        confrontation in Cuba may throw light on certain of the military and
                        political threats which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must be
                        prepared to face. I believe that most probable threat is not a nuclear
                        attack or even an all-out conventional attack on Western Europe. It seems
                        far more likely that the Soviets will continue to engage in probes, tests,
                        exploitation of weak spots and efforts to divide. These may be bold and
                        backed by impressive force, but given their careful calculation of risks,
                        their emphasis on keeping events under control and their preference for a
                        blend of political and military action, the Soviets are likely to be
                        attracted by other and more tempting programs than nuclear war, or events
                        certain to lead to it. There can be little doubt that such a Soviet strategy
                        presents us with a most serious threat. Therefore, should we not emphasize
                        more the cases in which our position would be gravely weakened unless we can
                        apply effective counter-pressure with non-nuclear forces and emphasize less
                        those situations of major attack in which nuclear weapons must be used.

                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> already has very formidable
                        deterrents indeed.</p>
                    <p>It is quite likely, of course, that the nature of the Soviet threat has
                        changed precisely because <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has
                        constructed an adequate deterrent to more ambitious actions. That deterrent
                        will be maintained and strengthened. But I would suggest that <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s problems in the 1960's are radically
                        different from those of the late forties and that it is time for us to
                        discard those solutions and strategies that are no longer in tune with the
                        times.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Perspectives for the Future</hi></p>
                    <p>If we were to agree that the sudden massive Soviet assault on Europe is a
                        most unlikely contingency, how should this affect our planning? The
                        possibilities are many. Witness some of the events of the past ten years:
                        the suppression of uprisings in East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Soviet aid on
                        a substantial scale to the United Arab Republic and Iraq, attempts at
                        subversion in Africa, pressure on Berlin, and a rash but supple move into
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>We should expect analogous indirect or direct challenges to the security of
                        members of the Alliance to continue in the future. Members of the Alliance
                        are concerned with the containment of the Communist threat in parts of the
                        world outside of Europe. In such situations, there may be conflict, the
                        conflict may spread, and military responses by the Alliance may become
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>One can easily imagine such circumstances arising in the Middle East and
                        Africa. What is more difficult to support is that the appropriate response
                        would involve the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>We should not exclude Soviet subversion and political aggression backed up by
                        military measures in areas of even more direct and immediate concern to
                        Europe. Such countries as Finland, Austria, and Sweden are geographically
                        vulnerable and might, in some circumstances, become targets for these
                        tactics. We could not remain indifferent to actions in these areas that
                        would upset the military balance in Europe and threaten our security.</p>
                    <p>We also cannot exclude the possibility of spontaneous events that would bring
                        heightened danger of conflict—that is, events outside the control of either
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>There is, more directly, the ever-present danger of Soviet incursions into
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> territory itself. Berlin is the
                        most exposed area, but the flanks and the center also contain potential
                        targets of military pressure and attack.</p>
                    <p>Should any of these more likely contingencies arise, they would be highly
                        dangerous. Inaction, or weak action, could result in a serious setback, a
                        missed opportunity, or even disaster. Nor can we entirely discount <pb
                            n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0474"/>the possibility that such limited
                        conflicts might lead to a major Soviet attack. Such an attack might involve
                        the use of nuclear weapons locally in Europe. It might even be the grand
                        non-nuclear invasion of Western Europe. Or it might take the form of an
                        all-out nuclear assault although this is still more doubtful.</p>
                    <p>A review of these contingencies suggests, first, the conflicts most likely to
                        occur will almost certainly begin in a non-nuclear fashion. Second, <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or some of its members may have to take a
                        military counter-initiative. Third, if we can manage local conflicts
                        successfully against a background of increased and adequate strength, we
                        will not have to meet the remote contingencies. Fourth, our military posture
                        should be as relevant to the likely as to the unlikely contingencies.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that we should ignore the remote contingencies of nuclear
                        or major non-nuclear attack. Quite the contrary. It makes a great deal of
                        sense to prepare for the unlikely—especially when the lack of preparation
                        would bring about catastrophic consequences.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I wish to take up two questions as urgent matters for the
                        Alliance: first, what additional capabilities do we need in order to meet
                        the real challenges that are apt to face us; second, what resources will be
                        needed over the next five years in order to reach these goals?</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Strategic Nuclear Posture</hi></p>
                    <p>Since I have recently reported to you at length on the strategic nuclear
                        posture of the Alliance, there are only a few additional points on this
                        subject that I wish to bring to your attention. This awesome capability
                        would naturally be the decisive element in any major nuclear war. In its
                        deterrent function it remains a necessary—but not sufficient—condition of
                        flexibility and initiative in other realms. The United States, in
                        recognition of these facts, has every intention of maintaining the forces
                        adequate to these two tasks. Plans are also in hand to increase the choices
                        open to the strategic forces and to permit the exercise of the greatest
                        discrimination possible in the conduct of strategic attacks if these forces
                        should be called into play. U. S. programs, extending to 1968, provide,
                        within the limits permitted by technology, timely and coordinated coverage
                        of major strategic forces that might threaten the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>It is the view of the United States, in the light of this assessment, that
                        Alliance expenditures in the strategic nuclear field—$15 billion per year in
                        the case of the U. S. alone—remain adequate for the contingency of general
                        nuclear war and its deterrence. The addition of nuclear vehicles in current
                        programs is already producing sharply declining marginal returns, partly
                        because of the investments already made, but also because the Soviets are
                        moving steadily toward a land-based and sea-based strategic nuclear force
                        protected by hardening, mobility and dispersal. A basic change is taking
                        place in the nuclear relationship between <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443"
                            facs="0475"/><gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Soviet Union.
                        Both sides are rapidly increasing their nuclear strength. <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is and will undoubtedly remain ahead in
                        most relevant dimensions: number of warheads and major delivery vehicles,
                        degree of protection, diversity of systems, and effectiveness of command and
                        control. But the benefits of this military advantage will be sharply reduced
                        as compared with those of the 1940's and 1950's. In the circumstances of the
                        1960's, it now appears that general nuclear war is likely to be even more
                        devastating than appeared probable when I spoke to you at Athens, however
                        much we might try further to strengthen our offensive capabilities.</p>
                    <p>If military considerations alone were at issue, I would therefore recommend
                        against the commitment of Alliance resources to strategic nuclear forces
                        beyond those now programmed. It does not follow, however, that some shift
                        within present strategic nuclear programs may not be desirable, because of
                        course the problem is not military alone. It is political, and its political
                        meaning is of great importance. We in the United States are deeply
                        interested in having these matters so managed that all members of the
                        Alliance can have full confidence in the effectiveness and reliability of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s strategic nuclear strength. We
                        fully recognize that this is a problem for the Alliance as a whole and that
                        no single member of the Alliance can or should attempt to monopolize
                        responsibility or authority.</p>
                    <p>We have an inescapable political, legal, and moral responsibility for the
                        management of the awesome power which our government controls. We have an
                        equal responsibility to deal faithfully with the Alliance. In our effort to
                        discharge this double responsibility we are seeking to make progress in two
                        major directions.</p>
                    <p>The first is the expansion of understanding, consultation, and advance
                        planning for the handling of the strategic deterrent. Inasmuch as more than
                        95 percent of strategic Alliance strength is American, we have a special
                        duty here, and we want to do more to fulfill it. We are accelerating
                        programs already begun for this purpose, and we are determined to search
                        with you for new and stronger instruments of active consultation.</p>
                    <p>Our second effort is to explore the ways and means by which the Alliance as a
                        whole might come to share effectively in the actual operations, manning,
                        deployment and support of the strategic deterrent. For reasons we have
                        expressed before we doubt if the best solution here is an expanding series
                        of separate national efforts (though we have no desire to reopen an argument
                        on which feelings are strong)—and so we have been assisting in the
                        exploration of a possible multilateral arrangement. We shall continue in the
                        effort, and I want to make it very clear that in this exploration our
                        central interest is to assist as best we can in meeting the legitimate
                        security interests of our European partners. In great measure, <pb n="444"
                            xml:id="pg_444" facs="0476"/>necessarily, judgment on what is wanted and
                        needed must come from our European friends, but we emphasize again our
                        readiness to help to the limit in exploring every one of the relevant
                        questions of technique, deployment, control, financing, and policy—and our
                        equal readiness to join with others in the necessary action to create a
                        multilateral force.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Tactical Nuclear Posture</hi></p>
                    <p>What we may need in the tactical nuclear field is a more difficult question
                        to answer. As one of the more remote contingencies, the Alliance must
                        recognize and prepare for the possibility that the Soviets would initiate
                        the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. Furthermore, since <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, even with appropriate non-nuclear
                        increases, could not expect to have non-nuclear superiority everywhere,
                        there are situations in which the Alliance might perceive an apparent
                        advantage in using nuclear weapons locally. Alternatively, it has been
                        suggested we might wish to use nuclear weapons on a large scale, but try to
                        limit their use geographically. As I observed at Athens, however, we see no
                        effective operational boundary which could be counted on to restrict such a
                        war according to intensity or area. In particular, because of the problems
                        of target acquisition and troop densities, the pressure to employ
                        large-yield nuclear weapons to support a tactical nuclear engagement would
                        almost certainly rise. And in all likelihood the accompanying civilian
                        damage would be extremely great.</p>
                    <p>At this juncture, however, it is premature to suggest specific changes in our
                        tactical nuclear programs. Because of the great strategic and tactical
                        nuclear power already at our disposal, we have time. I strongly urge that we
                        use the time not only to review our programs but also to re-examine the
                        assumption that tactical use of nuclear weapons by both sides would
                        generally be to the advantage of the Alliance.</p>
                    <p>I want to make it perfectly clear that it is our intention to maintain and to
                        increase tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. However, I doubt that they are
                        the means by which we can compensate for non-nuclear weaknesses.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Non-Nuclear Posture</hi></p>
                    <p>It seems to me to be quite clear that a stronger non-nuclear posture would
                        confer large political benefits on the Alliance, and especially on its
                        European members. It would give them a sense of freedom and initiative that
                        primary reliance on nuclear power does not provide. It would enhance their
                        bargaining power with the Soviet Union. It would enhance the attractive
                        power of Western Europe to Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>In the contingencies I earlier categorized as likely, non-nuclear force may
                        very well have to be used locally, in strength, and very probably against
                        Soviet forces. We may find it necessary to conduct a probe in strength, to
                        block Soviet forces from a threatening deployment, to repel a <pb n="445"
                            xml:id="pg_445" facs="0477"/>Soviet incursion into <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> territory, or to apply force in one
                        locality in order to relieve enemy pressure against a different area. For
                        this we need strong, deployable forces, with adequate air and sea lift, and
                        pre-stocking of supplies and equipment, forces that are exercised
                        realistically in peacetime.</p>
                    <p>Essential to this ability to deploy and use non-nuclear strength locally is a
                        strong non-nuclear forward defense. We will want to be able to take action
                        without dangerously weakening our defensive position. Such action is made
                        more perilous if it leaves us vulnerable to a Soviet counter-action.
                        Moreover, the stronger our non-nuclear forces, the more time we will have to
                        develop and exploit advantageous courses of action—local and global,
                        diplomatic and military.</p>
                    <p>In reviewing the prospects for a stronger non-nuclear posture, let us look at
                        the overall strengths of the two sides. On most overall measures <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has a position of some superiority in
                        non-nuclear arms over the Warsaw Pact countries. It has more men under arms,
                        6 million to 4 million. It has more tactical aircraft worldwide, 15,000 to
                        about 10,000. It has more major combat ships, 730 to 610. In terms of basic
                        resources that bear especially on non-nuclear strength, it has far greater
                        industrial resources and manpower. We are superior in a wide range of
                        technical skills and our population aggregates 490 million as against 320
                        million. Of course not all of these resources are directly applicable in any
                        particular locality on short notice. But this is true on both sides. Just as
                        members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> have military interests,
                        and forces, in the Far and Middle East, so do the Soviets. In short, our
                        problem is not resources, but the low effectiveness of many of our forces,
                        the likelihood that the Soviets will have the military initiative, and the
                        Soviet position of operating in a geographically more compact area.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> stated that they had
                        discussed the defense budget thoroughly with the Joint Chiefs and the
                        Service Secretaries and had also given the President their views beforehand.
                        They wanted the Joint Chiefs to do the talking at this meeting and they
                        would comment as the discussion grew.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> summarized the Navy
                        viewpoint and included the comment that for the Joint Chiefs it was a
                        difficult period of transition in two respects; first, the technological
                        advances in weaponry were tremendous; and, second, they had to recognize
                        that we were approaching a point where both sides hold a Sword of Damocles
                        (in the nuclear sense) over the Soviet and the free world heads which could
                        inhibit the use of nuclear weapons against each other's homeland while
                        fairly large-scale war with conventional forces—including war at sea—might
                        take place.</p>
                    <p>Although this is the 1964 budget, <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Admiral
                            Anderson</persName> pointed out, it really forecasts in many respects
                        what the 1968-70 capabilities would be. Consequently, it has long-range
                        connotations. For the Navy, he found two major difficulties for Fiscal 1964:
                        personnel is too limited to be really adequate, and the funds for
                        operations, spare parts and maintenance were less than required. In spite of
                        this, however, they were going to do the job and meet commitments. To meet
                        one of these problems, he hoped <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0479"/>to
                        reduce the tempo of operations wherever possible. He pleaded that in these
                        areas, the Navy be given more control over the decisions about their
                        operations and about the handling of their personnel. He pointed out that
                        new ships take more people than old ships take in the era of technological
                        change, and that the Navy actually needed 685,000 people, which would be an
                        increase of 20,000. Instead, they have an allowance of 670,000. So they will
                        be undermanned in some areas. In some cases they would have to man standby
                        ships with 20% crew strength and either transfer some ships to the reserves
                        or call up reserves in case of an emergency. The personnel hurts especially
                        in the short-term area.</p>
                    <p>For the long-term, the Navy's greatest concern is the adequacy of the
                        shipbuilding program to replace old ships. From the Navy's request, their
                        shipbuilding program was reduced by a half-dozen ships. The program is well
                        balanced but it leaves the Navy with the knowledge that in 1970 there will
                        be a greater percentage of over-age ships than should be in the fleet. As an
                        example, the Navy asked for eight nuclear attack submarines and the number
                        was reduced to six. The lead time on a submarine is 40-plus months. Aircraft
                        procurement is less than needed—for example, the Navy asked for 180 F-4-Hs
                        and it was reduced to 132.</p>
                    <p>In research and development, <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Admiral
                            Anderson</persName> was convinced the Navy could use more money; at the
                        same time he pledged that the Navy could and would use the money they have
                        in the best way possible to meet its requirements. He reiterated his pleas
                        for more Navy authority, with more attention being paid to professional
                        judgment in all of the fields he mentioned.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the progress on surface-to-surface missiles.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Admiral Anderson</persName> reported much
                        progress in adapting surface-to-air missiles to the surface-to-surface role,
                        but they hadn't fully licked the problem. Work in this area continues.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about Soviet ships carrying surface-to-surface missiles
                        and <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Admiral Anderson</persName> confirmed his
                        statement and said that primary reliance for countering them at the present
                        time is attack by naval aircraft.</p>
                    <p>The President asked, in relation to the missiles in Cuba, about the 30-40
                        mile range missiles that are on shore which would keep the fleet way out.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Admiral Anderson</persName> answered that
                        they would have to knock those out by either carrier- or land-based air
                        before making a landing in their vicinity.</p>
                    <p>In the field of antisubmarine warfare, <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Admiral
                            Anderson</persName> stated that there was no magic breakthrough in
                        sight, and that current developments are incremental in continuing
                        improvements over past capabilities. He said that they would keep working on
                        the problem but that we should have no illusions as to its magnitude even
                        though we had considerable <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0480"/>success
                        in the Cuban operations over Soviet conventionally powered submarines. He
                        also pointed out the important contributions on the part of our allies,
                        indicating his apprehension that the British interest in achieving an
                        independent nuclear capability might result in a decrease of British naval
                        capabilities in <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> and meeting worldwide
                        commitments.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> stated that the 1964
                        budget was most satisfactory from the Army point of view and that, as Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had pointed out in a
                        general purpose forces paper,<note n="1" xml:id="d121fn1"><ref
                                target="#d115">Document 115</ref>.</note> the Army would be in the
                        best shape it has been since Korea. There are $3.3 billions of PEMA funds,
                        of which $3.2 billion is in new obligational authority. This would give the
                        Army sufficient funds to procure the initial complement of combat equipment
                        required for the 16 active and 6 priority reserve divisions plus such
                        replacements, spares and combat consumables as are necessary to permit 16
                        divisions to operate in combat for the period between D-Day and the time
                        when the production resources of the country can furnish equipment at a rate
                        equal to combat consumption.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> pointed out that the
                        two greatest problems were personnel and Nike-Zeus. He spoke at some length
                        about the Army personnel situation with a 960,000 ceiling. Of this number,
                        406,000 people are devoted to other than direct divisional activity. Of the
                        remaining 554,000, there are 70,000 in Alaska, the Caribbean area, and
                        Berlin which had to be there but which would not really be counted on for
                        combat capabilities outside of those areas. This leaves the Army with a
                        “division slice” of about 36,000 for a division and its combat support
                        elements. The Army asked for more people, especially for artillery
                        battalions, signal units, etc. The result of this 960,000 ceiling would be
                        that the Army would have to depend on the reserves earlier in a war than
                        they would really like to. Meanwhile, General Wheeler is going over the Army
                        layer by layer to cut functions and to cut people, and he feels that the
                        greatest savings can only be made by cutting functions.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Nike-Zeus, there was a rather lengthy discussion with the
                        President, Secretary McNamara, General Taylor and General Wheeler, in which
                        they analyzed the results of a missile defense and discussed the Soviet
                        capabilities. The President made the point that at the present reading there
                        is a $9 billion deficit in the government budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1964. He said that it would just be too expensive to buy the
                        proportionate share of $19 billion spread over ten years for Nike-Zeus at
                        this stage.</p>
                    <p>The President questioned our forces in Europe and the advisability of trying
                        to maintain the equivalent of a six-division force with a logistic <pb
                            n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0481"/>base enabling it to fight for 60-90
                        days when the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies were not building
                        the conventional forces to make a 90-day conventional warfare a possibility.
                        The French have a 5-10 day supply basis, the Germans hopefully would have 90
                        days in the near future, and in substance <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> would only have 18 divisions, plus or minus a few spare
                        parts which could be put on a 90-day basis, unless the allies improve their
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>General Wheeler stated, and it was the consensus, that our only realistic
                        approach was to get the allies to move forward on the conventional force
                        program.</p>
                    <p>In a discussion of the need for the equivalent of six divisions, as opposed
                        to a lesser number, General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                        pointed out the fact that our air bases are forward in Germany and must be
                        protected until they can be effective in carrying out their part of the
                        mission, even if we opt for a shorter period (10 days) from D-Day to the use
                        of nuclear weapons. This led the President to question the advisability of
                        the U.S. keeping a total of 257,000 people there to support six divisions on
                        a 60- to 90-day basis, if future strategy dictates our earlier resort to
                        nuclear warfare.</p>
                    <p>The President said that U.S. forces in Europe would have to be “thinned out”
                        unless <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies improved their readiness
                        and supported the forward strategy. He said that he expects Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the Joint Chiefs to
                        make a judgment during 1963 about whether this effort with our allies is
                        going to be successful or unsuccessful. As a corollary, he said that he felt
                        that a judgment would also have to be made on whether we, along with our
                        allies, can ever fight a conventional war for 60-90 days in Europe, and if
                        we decide that a non-nuclear war for that long is not a real possibility,
                        then we should certainly examine the level of supply that we now plan as
                        essential. This corollary judgment would be especially applicable if our
                        allies don't come through with the necessary cooperation to make
                        conventional warfare a possibility.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Admiral Anderson</persName> remarked that some
                        of our allies would never make a realistic contribution comparable to that
                        of the United States until they were again genuinely afraid of the threat to
                        their homelands.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated what Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                            >Macmillan</persName> told him about President de Gaulle's attitude<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">Not further identified.</note> and the question
                        that it raised; how much in depth must we keep in Europe as we are faced
                        with a decision to draw back and resort to nuclear warfare? Throughout the
                        President's discussion there was emphasis on the gold outflow which must be
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> said that we might
                        force the Europeans to do more by actually pulling out some of the ground
                        forces.</p>
                    <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0482"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> pointed out that Spain
                        might be brought into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to assist in
                        this conventional buildup, and General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1"
                            >LeMay</persName> praised the agreement that we have with the Spanish.
                        The President countered this, stating that the attitude of the Spanish in
                        cashing every dollar they earn for gold and hurting us by this method hardly
                        encourages the advisability of doing much more with Spain. He pointed out
                        that our gold reserve now stands at $15.75 billion, and that there is a $12
                        billion floor on this gold cache, leaving us a $3.75 billion cushion, which
                        is being eaten up at the rate of $2.5 billion a year. He stated that unless
                        we stop the gold outflow in a hurry we will have reached the floor, and by
                        1964 we will have to have some new decisions.</p>
                    <p>The President questioned also the 30% of infrastructure for <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that we pay. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that infrastructure
                        would soon be up for renegotiation. There was mention of a flat statement to
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that 20% is going to be our new
                        percentage, take it or leave it. The President mentioned that the U.S. is
                        spending a larger percentage of its gross national product on defense than
                        any of our allies, and that we have a larger proportion of men in the armed
                        forces compared to the number of people in our country than any of the other
                        allies. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that
                        we would probably just have to pull 50,000 to 70,000 people out in order to
                        reduce the gold costs, and promised that he would submit a plan for the
                        withdrawal of 50,000 to 70,000 men from Europe.</p>
                    <p>All agreed that we must concentrate on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> area in the next few months to see if <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> couldn't solve this problem.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Nike-Zeus, the President asked if the Army could assure
                        production and deployment on a schedule to be effective in 1967. There
                        followed a lengthy discussion, with General Wheeler leading, on the
                        two-stage deployment problem and the difference in costs between the Army's
                        $19 billion idea and the Department of Defense $16.2 billion idea. In Fiscal
                        1964 the difference in investment costs would be only $270 million.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that
                        we already have $370 million in Nike-Zeus research and development and an
                        additional $100 million for research and development in allied fields which
                        helps Nike-Zeus. This he felt was all that could be afforded. There followed
                        a discussion about whether or not we would ever use Nike-Zeus, the factors
                        involving a Soviet decision to attack either our hard missile sites or our
                        cities, and the number of people that a $19 billion program might save.</p>
                    <p>The President then turned to General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1"
                            >LeMay</persName> who opened with a statement that in his five years of
                        budget planning this had been the best with the greatest amount of agreement
                        among the Chiefs and the best feeling of support from their civilian
                        superiors, including the President, that the Joint Chiefs had ever had.</p>
                    <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0483"/>
                    <p>Concerning his misgivings, he feels that the Air Force assault forces are too
                        small, specifically needing four more squadrons of C-130s to meet
                        requirements. This would mean fifteen planes per squadron at $2.5 million
                        each. As far as aircraft replacement is concerned, General LeMay felt that
                        we are “putting off the day” and we are eventually building up trouble for
                        ourselves. General LeMay mentioned the reserve callup and the efficiency of
                        the reserve forces and their reaction to the Cuban situation.</p>
                    <p>Changing the subject to tactical fighters, he stated that we are now
                        overcommitted and that our modernization is too slow. The Air Force had
                        asked for a second source for the F-4-C, which had been turned down, in
                        spite of the fact that the increase in fighter production from twelve to
                        fifteen a month is still all going to the Navy until Fiscal 1964.</p>
                    <p>In regard to air defense, General LeMay pointed out that there was not much
                        in the budget for it, and that the F-106 is the newest fighter-interceptor
                        and even that aircraft is out of production; therefore, we should seek a
                        replacement. He stated that the Air Force had asked for a Mach-3, 1200-mile
                        range fighter, with improved radar, a project which had been turned down. He
                        pointed out that the Soviet Union was equipping its bomber force with
                        air-to-ground missiles which could be launched at greater range from our
                        targets and that this new fighter was an essential, in his option.</p>
                    <p>He also mentioned that as far as the military aspects of space are concerned,
                        we are not going fast enough.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> emphasized that his
                        biggest worry is in the strategic field and that the trend is bad. He felt
                        that the trend is toward an all-missile force, and he has two or three
                        objections; first, with an all-missile force we were simplifying the Russian
                        program; secondly, we were moving away from the flexibility that we now have
                        in our strategic forces; and third, intelligence estimates indicate that
                        more flexibility is needed, not less. He stated that he had given all these
                        arguments to the Secretary and had been properly heard, but his misgivings
                        were still strong.</p>
                    <p>The President then questioned the group in regard to the number of Minutemen,
                        Polaris and Titan missiles, and opened a discussion on the Soviet missile
                        capability. All this was discussed at some length and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> pointed out again that our main
                        objective was not to match missile for missile but to deter any war from
                        starting. The basic question to answer is: what will deter the Soviet Union?
                        His own answer was that the flexibility of the mixed force was much more
                        potent in deterrence—especially in deterring the conventional war—than an
                        all-missile force.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that he had two concerns about this budget:
                        transport, both sea and air, and communications.</p>
                    <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0484"/>
                    <p>There was some discussion about the lead time on the C-130. The Chiefs felt
                        that it is roughly eighteen months, but Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> believes that it is more like
                        9-12 months lead time.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SGDM1">Shoup</persName> was asked to comment
                        and he stated that the Marine Corps would spend 2% of the defense budget,
                        and so far as he was concerned, when materials to be procured with 1964
                        funds are on hand, the Marines were the best they had ever been in
                        peacetime. Their personnel has a small problem as the enlistments ebbed and
                        flowed, but this could be overcome. Further, the Marine Corps reserves were
                        in better shape than they had ever been in and could make a real
                        contribution. General LeMay gave the President one quote: “War is not
                        efficient,” and consequently, its needs and its plans couldn't be run by
                        computer efficiency measurements.</p>
                    <p>In summarizing, the President pointed out that this Administration had put
                        more money in defense in the past two years than any other previous
                        Administration. He pointed out that we have almost had war in Laos, we had
                        almost had war in Cuba, and we had had an ultimatum in Berlin. We have also
                        been engaged in Soviet Viet-Nam almost constantly for twenty-two months. It
                        was quite apparent to him that more dollars were needed rather than less. He
                        also stated that in the foreseeable future we would have at least as many
                        troubles, and that in Latin America we could anticipate even more problems
                        than we had faced so far. He stated that we had gone from $44 billion up to
                        $49 billion and that we are now at $52 billion, making a more intensive
                        effort in free world defense than had ever been planned.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he is very interested in what we do in this field and
                        he wants to be sure that we are doing enough. He charged the Joint Chiefs to
                        be constantly mindful of this. He also pointed out that they had to be
                        mindful—although it was not their primary concern—that he was facing a
                        budget with a $9 billion deficit and that this had to enter into the Chiefs'
                        consideration as they surveyed the needs to make sure that we are doing
                        enough.</p>
                    <p>The President directed that the Chiefs review the transport problem, both sea
                        and air, with Secretary McNamara and give him a report before they lock up
                        this 1964 budget. <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Admiral Anderson</persName>
                        commented that they should immediately put some LSTs on the list and that it
                        would call for a small addition to the Navy budget, but he could get them
                        out of moth balls and man them with a bare minimum of caretaker crews and
                        have them ready to haul the heavy weapons in case we are faced with the
                        possibility of another Cuban situation.</p>
                    <p>The President also directed that they look once more at the fighter aircraft
                        situation and give him a report on that.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out to the Joint Chiefs and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that although we feel that the
                        present Cuban situation is dormant, <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0485"
                        />we must assume that someday we may have to go into Cuba, and when it
                        happens, we must be prepared to do it as quickly as possible, with a minimum
                        of destruction. Therefore, they must provide for this contingency as they
                        look into one, two, three, or four years ahead.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that he felt this was a possibility in the next few
                        years whether he was President or not, and that they had to plan for
                        this.</p>
                    <p>Discussion of Cuba followed which included a statement by the President that
                        in any planning we must make sure that our “political work” is well done. If
                        there are defections to our side we must be ready to handle them and exploit
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The discussion which followed involved the “civil affairs and military
                        government” planning, as well as the special forces planning, in connection
                        with Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The President then discussed the Cuban Brigade, and the training of Cubans
                        that is now taking place.</p>
                    <p>An additional note on the budget was raised by <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1"
                            >Admiral Anderson</persName>. He pointed out that our military
                        construction was going to be a problem that would not go away. Even though
                        we are holding it to a minimum at the present, eventually all the Services
                        would need some new facilities.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the President asked that they look over the situation in Europe,
                        that they review the transport situation, that they maintain their present
                        efforts on communications, and that they search for even other occasions to
                        prevent the balance of payments from getting out of control.</p>
                    <p>As to Nike-Zeus, the President stated that it was his decision to stay with
                        the budget as it is now proposed.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the President said that it would almost seem that Europe is getting
                        a “free-ride” and that on both the political and defense side, this
                        situation with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies had to be
                        changed this year.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> presented a Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff proposal on testimony before Congressional committees which
                        was approved (copy attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">Not

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated that

                    <p>At the meeting of the Special Group (Counter-Insurgency) on January 3, 1963,
                        Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert F. Kennedy</persName>
                        “emphasized that the President looks upon the Group as having wider
                        responsibilities than the members seem to interpret them to be. He suggested
                        that the members give consideration to what the Group should now be doing.”
                        After <persName>U. Alexis Johnson</persName>, who had replaced General
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> as Chairman of the Special

                        programs it had helped to establish, <persName>Kennedy</persName> commented
                        that although these were the terms of reference, he felt that the monitoring
                        of programs was too restrictive, and that “the members should give thought
                        to redefining the Group's responsibilities.” (Memorandum by <persName>Thomas

                        character,” and that enlarging its role would “adversely impinge” on the
                        work of other interdepartmental mechanisms, including ad hoc working groups
                        as well as the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and the <gloss

                    <p>In another general discussion of the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1"
                            >CI</gloss>) during its meeting on January 24, <persName
                            corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> opened by saying that it had “a
                        pretty good charter now. He does not think that the committee should be
                        overloaded.” <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> thought the

                            Kennedy</persName> agreed and stated that the monitoring of established
                        programs should be done at a lower level. The Group should do “something
                        additional,” such as taking an overall look at countries which might be
                        potential trouble spots, and “figure out solutions and report to the
                        President. Emphasis should be on anticipating trouble.” It was “time to
                        apply the talents of this Group to other countries which do not necessarily
                        have a <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> problem.”</p>

                            >Bell</persName> remarked that other interagency committees were in some
                        cases doing for particular areas the job the Attorney General wanted done.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> stated: “If the Group
                        develops in this way, it would simply interpose another level between the
                        troops [working level] and the President. Why do this?”</p>
                    <p>The record of the meeting indicates that after <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName> pointed out that the Group was not in the “command
                        channel,” the meeting ended with a consensus that while “layering” might not
                        be a problem, it would be necessary for the Group to have a permanent staff,
                        possibly with a full time <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0487"/>chairman,
                        to perform the surveillance function of identifying trouble spots. The

                            125</ref>.</note> could you say a few words about our policy toward the
                        major neutrals? These are words best said privately at this juncture but
                        words which need saying nonetheless. Many officials, some high up, get so
                        annoyed at the words and antics of a Sukarno and a Nasser that they question
                        the underlying rationale of our policy shift.</p>
                    <p>Yet I am convinced that one of the major potential successes of your
                        Administration may flow from our more flexible policy toward the Nehrus,
                        Nassers, Sukarnos, Ben Bellas, and their ilk. This marks a genuine departure
                        from previous policy (though the last Administration was gradually shifting
                        in this direction). We are still in the early phases of this enterprise and
                        it isn't yet paying great dividends. But if we look on it as a long-term
                        investment, and remain undisturbed by any short-term fluctuations, it will
                        eventually show real capital gains.</p>
                    <p>To me, the underlying rationale for this policy is that in the game of
                        competitive co-existence, we can hardly afford to let the major neutralists
                        become clients primarily of Moscow. The Soviets have made a major effort in
                        this direction, but with the glittering exception of India, we have only
                        recently begun to compete.</p>
                    <p>Regrettably, the benefits of such a policy take less the form of visible
                        support for US positions than the largely negative form of refraining from
                        actions which would be most unfavorable to our interests. Yet, if we think
                        Nasser is misbehaving in the Yemen or Sukarno again showing undue
                        territorial appetite, we need merely ask ourselves how much more difficult
                        they would be if they didn't feel a real concern lest they sacrifice actual
                        and prospective aid from us. The trouble is that this is hardly a convincing
                        public rationale for giving aid.</p>
                    <p>Other problems arise from the simple fact that the policies of Nasser or
                        Sukarno cut across those of many other US friends; hence we are constantly
                        put in the position of being asked to choose between them. It would be
                        simpler, for example, to choose up sides in Yemen than to take the present
                        middle road. Yet to do so would cost us more with one side than we would
                        gain with the other. Similarly, in Southeast Asia, why spend billions
                        containing Communist pressures on the mainland while leaving the Communists
                        a free hand in the rich archipelago behind?</p>
                    <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0489"/>
                    <p>Those who cavil over our Nasser or Sukarno policy also ignore the absence of
                        any realistic alternative. We tried to get rid of Sukarno in 58—and failed.
                        Unless we think we can do so again we simply have to sweat him out. This is
                        not to advocate an exclusively soft approach, but to use the stick without
                        the carrot has failed again and again (as with the Aswan Dam).</p>
                    <p>It failed because it ran athwart of the strong nationalist attitudes of the
                        new Afro-Asian countries. Yet this very nationalism, which to date has
                        naturally focused on the former colonial powers and their associates, will
                        increasingly bring them into conflict with an expansionist Bloc. This has
                        already happened in India, where it was Peiping's blunder (plus our skill in
                        capitalizing on it) which has led to a shift in India's attitude toward them
                        and us. This will happen elsewhere if we let it mature. Time is on side
                        here.</p>
                    <p>A few words on this policy would forestall any misreading of your tactical
                        interest in sharp words or actions when needed.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2"

                        MEETING OF JANUARY 22, 1963</p>
                    <p>The President began his discussion of national security problems by calling
                        attention to the worldwide responsibilities of the United States. <pb
                            n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0490"/>While we fully recognize our
                        responsibilities, other states are not carrying their fair share of the
                        burden.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Cuba</hi></p>
                    <p>The major lesson of the Cuban crisis, the President said, was the paramount
                        importance of timing. Both sides, the United States and the USSR, need
                        sufficient time to consider alternative courses of action. Our objective was
                        and is to protect our national interests while trying to avoid a nuclear
                        exchange which, if it happened, would be a defeat for both sides. In
                        handling crises, it is important that the Russians have enough time to
                        debate their action. If they are forced to react in an hour or two, they may
                        react in a spasm and resort to nuclear war.<note n="1" xml:id="d125fn1">In a
                            memorandum for the record dated January 22, <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> summarized the President on this point as
                            follows: “The advantage of taking the second course was the fact that
                            the Soviets had time to consider alternatives and turn back the ships,
                            thus avoiding a spasmodic response which might have initiated nuclear
                            war.” (National Defense University, <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"

                            decision,<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">A Department of State memorandum
                            of this meeting, also dated January 22, reads in part: “He pointed out
                            that it was a ‘very close thing' between a U.S. decision to mount an air
                            strike against the Soviet installations and the final decision, the
                            quarantine.” (Department of State, Central Files, 711.5/1-2363)</note>
                        took several days to discuss and understand the advantages and disadvantages
                        of the alternatives. The reason for building up <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> conventional forces is to gain greater control over the
                        timing of a showdown in Europe provoked by the Russians.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that we must always be in a position to threaten
                        Cuba as a possible riposte to Russian pressure against us in Berlin. We must
                        always be ready to move immediately against Cuba in the event we decide such
                        action would be a more effective response to a Soviet initiative than a
                        nuclear response. We can use Cuba to limit Soviet actions in the way the
                        Russians use Berlin to limit our actions.<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">On
                            this point, the Department of State memorandum reads: “Also he said, we
                            should be prepared to move not only in Cuba but perhaps in Berlin
                            simultaneously. We now have a hostage in this hemisphere just as the
                            Russians have had one in Berlin for several years.”</note></p>

                    <p>Turning to Europe, the President recalled that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                            Gaulle</persName>'s current policy is no different than that he has been
                        advocating since 1958 when he first proposed to President Eisenhower a
                        U.S.-U.K.- France directorate giving France, in effect, a veto on our use of
                        nuclear weapons. The suggestion was turned down because it would have broken
                        up NATO. This Administration agrees it was a correct decision. The turndown
                        of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s proposal was not,
                        however, the reason why he is behaving as he now is. Even if we had given
                        France nuclear weapons, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
                        would <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0491"/>have tried to restore France
                        to a predominant position in Europe. For years, in speeches and in his
                        memoirs, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> has expressed his
                        view that France must be a dominant power speaking to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the West as an equal, dependent on no
                        one.</p>
                    <p>In analyzing <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>'s present
                        actions, the President said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
                        did not question our support of Europe. The proof that he does not fear we
                        would desert him is the deployment of only a small number of French troops
                        opposite the Russians in Germany. He relies on our power to protect him
                        while he launches his policies based solely on the self-interest of France.
                        Having been turned down by the U.S. and U.K. on the directorate, <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> turned to Germany. This helps to
                        keep Germany from looking to the Russians. It does threaten <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                            Gaulle</persName> strongly opposes.</p>
                    <p>As to the Common Market, the President said that if Great Britain joined,
                        Europe would be strengthened and stabilized. We favor the U.K. joining even
                        though it will cost the U.S. considerable trade. If France keeps Britain
                        out, this will be a setback for us but a more severe setback for the
                        U.K.</p>
                    <p>Our interest, the President continued, is to strengthen the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> multilateral force concept, even though
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is opposed, because a
                        multilateral force will increase our influence in Europe and provide a way
                        to guide <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and keep it strong. We have
                        to live with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. One way to
                        respond is to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and push for
                        a multilateral nuclear force which will weaken <persName corresp="#p_DGC1"
                            >de Gaulle</persName>'s control of the Six.<note n="4" xml:id="d125fn4"
                                ><persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s memorandum
                            summarizes the President as saying at this point: “It is through the
                            multilateral concept that we increase the dependence of the European
                            nations on the United States and tie these nations closer to us. Thus,
                            we thwart de Gaulle who wants to cause a split between Europe and the
                            United States.”</note> We should not be overly distressed because the
                        problems caused by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> are not
                        crucial in the sense that our problems in Latin America are.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">U.S. Trade Negotiations</hi></p>
                    <p>The President then summarized the guidelines for forthcoming trade
                        negotiations. In the present situation, we must be very careful to protect
                        U.S. interests. Our balance of payments problem is serious, it is not now
                        under control, and it must be righted at the latest by the end of 1964. If
                        we do not do so, there will be pressure against the dollar and Congress will
                        be demanding reductions on our foreign programs.</p>
                    <p>One effort we must make, the President continued, is to seek to prevent
                        European states from taking actions which make our balance of payments
                        problem worse. For example, we maintain large forces in Germany. We must
                        firmly oppose West Germany if it increases its agricultural production to
                        our detriment. We have not yet reached the point of wheat against troops but
                        we cannot continue to pay for the military protection of Europe while the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> states are not paying their fair
                            <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0492"/>share and living off the “fat
                        of the land.” We have been very generous to Europe and it is now time for us
                        to look out for ourselves, knowing full well that the Europeans will not do
                        anything for us simply because we have in the past helped them. No longer
                        dependent on the U.S. for economic assistance, the European states are less
                        subject to our influence. If the French and other European powers acquire a
                        nuclear capability they would be in a position to be entirely independent
                        and we might be on the outside looking in. We must exploit our military and
                        political position to ensure that our economic interests are protected.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Attitude Toward Neutrals</hi></p>
                    <p>Referring to criticism by those who say we are treating neutrals as favorably
                        as allies, the President said he did not believe such criticism was sound
                        but we shouldn't be over-confident ourselves. For example, the Pakistanis
                        oppose our giving military assistance to the Indians. Despite the fact that
                        the Pakistanis are our allies, we must recognize the importance of India. If
                        the Indians joined the Chinese, we would have no free South Asia. Our aim is
                        to make the sub-continent of Asia strong. Even under present Indian
                        leadership, we can work with India just as we must use our ally Pakistan to
                        achieve our aim of keeping the sub-continent out of the Communist camp. We
                        cannot permit all those who call themselves neutrals to join the Communist
                        bloc. Therefore, we must keep our ties to Nasser and other neutralists even
                        if we do not like many things they do because, if we lose them, the balance
                        of power could swing against us.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Assistance to Foreign Countries</hi></p>
                    <p>The President said he wanted to make clear that we are giving aid to foreign
                        countries in order to increase the security of the United States—not
                        primarily for humanitarian reasons. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                        programs should be tested against the contribution they make toward
                        improving our national security. Recalling that the military could always
                        get Congress to appropriate funds for military assistance, the President
                        asked that Defense Department officials help sell Congress on economic
                        assistance. Some Congressmen will try to cut the heart out of the <gloss
                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program. Should they succeed, we would be
                        in real danger. A major effort is required to prevent this. We must make
                        every effort to keep countries out of the Communist bloc. Once a country is
                        in, we know from experience that it is very difficult to get it out. We
                        cannot risk the possibility of four or five countries suddenly turning
                        Communist just because we did not give them economic and military aid. An
                        outside group is now reviewing the existing <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                            >AID</gloss> program for the purpose of ensuring that our assistance to
                        foreign countries will best serve our own national interest.<note n="5"

                    <p>In introducing his remarks on domestic issues, the President emphasized the
                        major effort which has been made to hold down the budget deficit now
                        estimated at about $12 billion. The current budget shows increases only for
                        defense, space and the fixed charge of interest on the national debt.</p>
                    <p>Our economic growth rate over the past ten years, he continued, has been too
                        slow, particularly in view of the great increase in our population.</p>
                    <p>We must avoid another recession which would endanger our gold position and
                        have a bad psychological effect on the American people. In comparison with
                        the Russians who are making a major effort to improve their domestic
                        economy, we must not give the impression of just drifting lest other states
                        draw the conclusion that we cannot deal with our domestic economic
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>An unbalanced budget as such is not worrisome especially when we realize that
                        our present deficit is a reflection of the hot and cold war we have been

                        in this respect because if it is passed by the Congress we will be in much
                        better shape.</p>
                    <p>It is unnecessary to point out that all these matters, <gloss

                        program are all related. If we become weaker, economically, our influence
                        abroad will be reduced. If this happens, the entire Free World position
                        weakens. It is basic to our national security to have a strong domestic
                        economy.</p>

                    <p>Recalling recent decisions limiting or halting certain military programs,
                        e.g. the B-70, Skybolt, and Nike-Zeus, the President said we are going
                        forward with large defense and space programs. If the necessity develops, we
                        will do even more, but there is a limit to how much we can do.</p>
                    <p>One of our big tasks is to persuade our colleagues in Europe to increase
                        their defense forces. If we are to keep six divisions in Europe, the
                        European states must do more. Why should we have in Europe supplies adequate
                        to fight for ninety days when the European forces around our troops have
                        only enough supplies to fight for two or three days? Our forces in Europe

                    <p>The President reviewed the background of the current negotiations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on a test ban treaty. Our primary
                        purpose in trying to get a treaty with Russia is to halt or delay the
                        development of an atomic capability by the Chinese Communists.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d125fn6">Concerning this point, the Department of State
                            memorandum reads: “He thought a test ban agreement might produce
                            pressure against development of such a [Chinese nuclear] capability. Any
                            negotiations that can hold back the Chinese Communists are most
                            important, he said, because they loom as our major antagonists of the
                            late 60's and beyond.”</note> We will have a difficult time protecting
                        the free areas of Asia if the Chinese get nuclear weapons. A test ban
                        including only the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the British, and
                        the U.S. would not be very meaningful except in regard to the Chinese
                        problem which the Russians are believed to be as concerned about as we are.
                        If we get a treaty we think we can live with, all of us must support it in
                        order to overcome Congressional opposition which undoubtedly will
                        develop.</p>
                    <p>Concluding his remarks, the President thanked the assembled officers for
                        their cooperation, commented on the harmonious relations which exist among
                        the Departments and Agencies, and expressed the hope that during the coming

                        Country Studies” to be initiated by the Council. (Memorandum entitled

                        Rusk, and “a very few others.” Bundy's “own guess” was that Rostow needed “a
                        real sense of your own interest and some sense of priorities,” and he
                        concluded that perhaps some long-range problems could be considered in the
                        new Standing Committee (see Document 131). (National Defense University,

                            insurgency threat, Internal Defense Plans have been prepared for all the
                            countries you have assigned to the Group (Bolivia, Cambodia, Colombia,
                            Ecuador, Guatemala, Iran, Laos, Thailand, Venezuela, and Viet-Nam) with
                            the exception of Laos, where, owing to the unique situation, an Internal
                            Defense Plan is not considered to be useful at this time. In addition, a

                                the next four months. In general, the training program has been
                                carried out through the inclusion of counter-insurgency instruction
                                within the context of regular career courses.</p>
                            <p>In addition, counter-insurgency training has been included in over

                                the last six months. Military mobile counter-insurgency training
                                teams have been deployed to forty countries, representing an

                        <item>Review of Paramilitary Assets. As you are aware, in June, 1961 it was
                            decided to make a review of the paramilitary assets of the United States
                            and of the likely requirements for their use. The completed report
                            indicated that in some cases our resources are inadequate. Action is
                            being taken by the responsible departments and agencies to overcome the
                            deficiencies. A six-months study to identify research and development
                            areas in need of emphasis was completed in December. A report will
                            shortly be submitted to the Group, setting forth what has been done by
                            the two agencies concerned to overcome the deficiencies noted in the
                            study.</item>

                        <item>Civic Action. In the field of civic action the Group has continued to
                            encourage expansion, both within the areas of large scale activities
                            such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, and in the yet untapped areas
                            of the Near East and Africa. In Africa civic action programs are planned
                            for Senegal and Liberia. In the Near East programs are under way in
                            Jordan, Iran, and Pakistan. In Southeast Asia a significant program has
                            recently been initiated in Indonesia, where it is believed that the
                            planned civic action program can make a significant contribution to the
                            economic development of the country and the productive employment of the
                            military forces. In all, civic action programs currently being funded
                            total over $72 million, of which $40 million are for South
                            Viet-Nam.</item>

                        <item>Police Assistance. An expanded and reinvigorated program of police
                            assistance to underdeveloped countries has been initiated during the
                            past six months. The worldwide level of this program has increased from
                            about $14 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 to about $30
                            million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963. We currently provide
                            advice, assistance, and equipment through police advisory missions to
                            thirty countries and have centralized the administration of the program
                            in a new Office of Public Safety located within <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>. New missions are being planned for eight other

                    <p>Summary. Recognition has been obtained throughout the United States
                        Government that subversive insurgency is a major form of politico/military
                        conflict. Necessary adjustments have been made within the organizations of
                        the several departments and agencies. Counter-insurgency doctrine has been
                        developed, and issued as national policy. Emphasis has been given to
                        counter-insurgency throughout the Government's school systems concerned with
                        foreign affairs. Research and development activities of the military and
                        intelligence services have been reviewed and adjusted to counter-insurgency
                        needs. Paramilitary resources, civic action programs, and police support
                        programs have all been expanded. Internal Defense Plans have been prepared
                        for the countries assigned to the Group.<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4">A June

                            indicated a possible 1962 missile gap; that by June 1961 it was
                            “apparent that Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment
                            had not proceeded as rapidly as was previously estimated” and that the
                            “most dramatic downward revision in estimates” took place in September
                            1961. (Ibid.) For the forecasts made in June and September 1961, see

                        fact is that nothing happened. As noted in our previous memorandum, the term
                        “missile gap” was an extremely fuzzy one, and it was almost impossible to
                        discuss the subject without saying something which was misleading, or at
                        least sure to be interpreted in a misleading way. In short, there was, and
                        was not, a missile gap in early 1961, depending on whether you included
                        Polaris or not; whether you were worried that the Air Force estimate might
                        be right or not; whether you were thinking of a strategically significant
                        gap or merely a comparison of raw numbers, regardless of the practical
                        significance; and whether you were talking about something now or something
                        we feared was coming. It was under these circumstances that reporters came
                        away from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s background
                        briefing with the impression that he had said there was no gap.<note n="3"

                    <p>Given the disinclination of the Secretary of Defense to say anything to imply
                        that the U.S. was no longer confident it could defend its vital interests,
                        and taking into account the stories by responsible observers suggesting the
                        contrary, it is not surprising that the Secretary took this line. (See, for
                        example, Richard Rovere's Letter from Washington for 11 January 1961, which
                        is attached.)<note n="4" xml:id="d129fn4">Not attached. The article was

                    <p>If we are asked, in a political context, what was the difference between Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> denying there was a gap
                        and the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration
                        saying the same thing, the answer is this: Under <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName>, the denial that there was no gap was accompanied
                        by a belief, at the highest levels, that our defense posture was adequate;
                        under the new Administration, the denial was accompanied by an intense
                        awareness that although we were not in immediate great danger, urgent
                        immediate steps were nevertheless needed to improve our defense position.
                        Thus, although there was little difference in what Defense officials said
                        about the missile gap before and after January 1961, there were major
                        differences in what was done about the missile gap and the whole range of
                        defense deficiencies which this term had come to symbolize.<note n="5"

                        Soviet military problems. It includes, inter alia, summary versions of

                        individual military missions and other related questions.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Basic Views on War</hi></p>
                    <p>A. The Soviets see military power as serving two basic purposes: defense of
                        their system and support for its expansion. Thus, one of the most important
                        objectives of Soviet military policy is to deter general war while the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> prosecutes its foreign policies by
                        means short of actual hostilities involving Soviet forces. The Soviets
                        recognize that their deterrent must be credible in the sense that it rests
                        upon powerful military forces. They also recognize that deterrence may fail
                        in some key confrontation in which either they or their opponents come to
                        feel that vital interests are under challenge. Against this contingency they
                        wish to have a combination of offensive and defensive capabilities which
                        will enable them to seize the initiative if possible, to survive enemy
                        nuclear attack, and to go on to prosecute the war. We do not believe,
                        however, that the Soviets base their military planning or their general
                        policy upon the expectation that they will be able to achieve, within the
                        foreseeable future, a military posture which would make rational the
                        deliberate initiation of general war or conscious acceptance of grave risks
                        of such a war. (Paras. 1-3)</p>
                    <p>B. A number of Soviet statements in recent years have expressed the view that
                        limited war involving the major nuclear powers would inevitably escalate
                        into general war. While such statements are intended in part to deter the
                        West from local use of force, this official view also reflects a genuine
                        Soviet fear of the consequences of becoming directly engaged in limited war
                        involving Soviet and US forces. This probably also extends to involvement of
                        Soviet forces with certain Allied forces in highly critical areas, notably
                        Western forces in the European area. Nevertheless, they might employ their
                        own forces to achieve local gains in some area adjacent to Bloc territory if
                        they judged that the West, either because it was deterred by Soviet nuclear
                        power or for some other reason, would not make an effective military
                        response. They would probably employ Soviet forces as necessary if some
                        Western military action on the periphery of the Bloc threatened the
                        integrity of the Bloc itself. Should the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> become directly involved in a limited war with US or <pb
                            n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0503"/>Allied forces, we believe that the
                        Soviets would not necessarily expand it immediately into general war, but
                        that they would probably employ only that force which they thought necessary
                        to achieve their local objectives. They would also seek to prevent
                        escalation by political means. (Paras. 4-5)</p>
                    <p>C. The Soviets recognize another type of limited military conflict, termed a
                        “war of national liberation,” in which pro-Soviet or anti-Western forces
                        challenge colonial or pro-Western regimes in a primarily internal struggle.
                        The Soviets have rendered active assistance in some such conflicts, and
                        little or none in others, depending upon such practical factors as
                        accessibility, the risk of defeat, and the attitude of other powers
                        involved. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has given
                        military assistance to friendly, non-Bloc regimes. As new and favorable
                        opportunities arise, the Soviets will continue to offer these various kinds
                        of assistance. We believe, however, that they will remain chary of any great
                        commitment of prestige to the support of belligerents over whom they do not
                        exercise substantial control or in circumstances in which they feel that
                        winning is unlikely, and they will seek to avoid risk of widened hostilities
                        which might result from “wars of national liberation.” (Paras. 6-8)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">General Trends in Military Doctrine and
                            Policy</hi></p>
                    <p>D. Current Soviet military policy stems from <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>'s plan, announced in January 1960, to cut back
                        the size of the armed forces and to place main reliance on nuclear and
                        missile forces. The plan reflected his view that a general war is almost
                        certain to be short, with victory decided in the strategic nuclear exchange,
                        and with conventional arms playing a quite secondary role. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s plan was accepted only
                        reluctantly by the military leadership; both the plan and its strategic
                        justification have since undergone substantial modification. Present Soviet
                        military doctrine holds that a general war will inevitably involve the
                        massive use of nuclear weapons; it will begin with a strategic exchange, and
                        its course and outcome may well be decided in its initial phase. Hence,
                        doctrinal discussion emphasizes the importance of seizing the initiative by
                        pre-emptive attack if, in the Soviet view, general war becomes imminent and
                        unavoidable. However, the current doctrine holds that such a conflict will
                        not necessarily be short, and it supports both the building of strategic
                        attack and defense capabilities and the maintenance of large theater and
                        naval forces. (Paras. 13-16)</p>
                    <p>E. The Soviet leaders evidently believe that the present overall military
                        relationship, in which each side can exert a strong deterrent upon the
                        other, will probably continue for some time to come. However, they almost
                        certainly regard the present strategic posture of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as inferior to that of the US, and they
                        are aware of the continuing buildup of US forces for intercontinental attack
                        programmed for the next few years. In this situation, they probably do not
                        expect to be able to obtain a clear strategic <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472"
                            facs="0504"/>superiority over the US, but we believe that the Soviets
                        are far from willing to accept a position of strategic inferiority. Our
                        evidence does not indicate that the Soviets are attempting to outstrip or
                        even match the US in numbers of weapons for intercontinental attack; we
                        believe, however, that they will attempt to offset US superiority by other
                            means.<note n="1" xml:id="d130fn1">The Assistant Chief of Staff,
                            Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, agrees that the
                            Soviets probably do not expect to be able to achieve a position of clear
                            strategic superiority over the US during the time period of this
                            estimate and that they are far from willing to accept a position of
                            strategic inferiority. However, he believes that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is pursuing an intensive research and
                            development effort in the hope of attaining technological breakthroughs
                            which, when translated into weapon systems, will result in a clear
                            strategic superiority at a later date. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> (Paras. 21-26)</p>
                    <p>F. The Soviets may see a possible solution to their strategic confrontation
                        with the US in a combination of antimissile defenses plus very effective
                        though numerically inferior intercontinental striking forces. We believe
                        that deployment of antimissile defenses may be the largest new Soviet
                        military program in the period of this estimate. Hardened <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s and submerged-launch submarine missiles
                        will contribute to Soviet strategic capabilities. In addition, over the next
                        few years the Soviet arsenal will probably come to include new large <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, armed with very high-yield warheads or
                        capable of global ranges. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> is almost certainly investigating the feasibility of space
                        systems for military support and offensive and defensive weapons. (Paras.
                        27-28)</p>
                    <p>G. Official statements and military writings suggest that the Soviet leaders
                        see in technological achievements the means by which they may improve their
                        total strategic position relative to that of the US. They have made
                        scientific military research and the development of new weapons matters of
                        high urgency, and they have a demonstrated ability to concentrate human and
                        material resources on priority objectives. If they develop new concepts or
                        new weapons which give promise of military and political advantages, they
                        will seek to add them rapidly to their arsenal and to gain maximum benefit
                        from them. Thus, during the next five years, we expect the Soviets to be
                        working on even more advanced weapons with which they may hope to enhance
                        their strategic capabilities at a later date.<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2"

                    <p>H. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s military programs and space
                        efforts impose costly demands upon Soviet resources. The effort to modernize
                        and strengthen all arms of the Soviet forces simultaneously squeezes hard on
                        resources available for investment and consumption goals to which the
                        leadership is strongly committed. Thus, Khrushchev may once again seek a
                        reduction in resources devoted to theater forces on the grounds that growing

                        the economy, it would not significantly reduce the demands of the defense
                        establishment on critically scarce, high quality resources and highly

                    <p>I. Despite the possibility of a future reduction in theater forces, <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>'s 27 February speech indicates
                        that the Soviet leadership has recently taken economic decisions which
                        reaffirm military priorities at the expense of consumer aspirations; beyond
                        this it may reflect a decision to increase military spending above
                        previously planned levels. The Soviet economy is capable of bearing a
                        heavier military burden, but not without sacrifices in the program to raise
                        living standards and perhaps also reductions in the future rate of
                        industrial growth. For the present, the Soviets appear to have chosen to
                        risk these consequences, but we believe that the problem of resource
                        allocation will continue to plague the Soviet leadership. (Para. 47)</p>
                    <p>J. Soviet military policy will continue to be shaped, not only by a variety
                        of strategic, technical, economic, and political factors, but also by
                        differing views about the relative importance of these factors, and shifting
                        compromises among these views. As a result, we believe that the numerous
                        aspects of this policy will not always be wholly consistent with each other,
                        and that force structure and future programming will reflect neither a
                        fully-integrated strategic doctrine nor a firm timetable for achieving
                        specific force levels. We do not believe that the Soviets conceive of
                        existing weapon systems as the answer to their military problem, or that
                        they have fixed and inflexible plans for their force structure in the period
                        five to 10 years from now. Barring some major technical advance in weaponry,
                        we believe that Soviet military policy is likely to continue along current
                        lines, and that for at least the next few years large standing forces of all
                        types will be maintained. Even in the absence of such an advance, however,
                        we cannot exclude the possibility of new departures in military policy,
                        perhaps resulting in major changes in the composition of the Soviet military
                        establishment and in the relative emphasis given to forces designed to
                        accomplish the major military missions. (Paras. 29-30)</p>

                    <p>K. Although missile forces for attack on Eurasia continue to grow, major
                        emphasis in the building of long-range striking forces has evidently shifted
                        to forces for intercontinental attack, primarily ICBMs. We estimate Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength at the end of 1962 at
                        80-85 operational launchers, including a few silo-type hardened launchers.
                        By mid-1964, the force will probably have reached 250-325, including 75-100
                        silos. The Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force estimated for
                        the next two years will consist primarily of <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474"
                            facs="0506"/>missiles equipped with warheads in the low megaton range;
                        it could include a few missiles with very high-yield warheads. We believe
                        that the major trends in this force to 1967 will be: growth of the force to
                        some hundreds of launchers; hardening of a significant portion of the force;
                        and availability of some missiles capable of delivering very high-yield
                        warheads (up to 100 MT).<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">The Assistant Chief of

                            time required for site construction. Experience has shown that even with
                            the best available intelligence, and where evidence appeared to be

                        submarines—nine of them nuclear-powered—which carry a combined total of
                        about 125 short-range (350 n.m.) missiles designed for surfaced launching.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is developing longer range
                        missiles for launching from submerged submarines. In addition, the Soviets
                        have developed submarine-launched cruise missiles, which are probably
                        designed primarily for use against ships but could be employed against land
                        targets. In mid-1967, the Soviets will probably have more than two dozen
                        nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, and about 20 nuclear-powered
                        cruise missile submarines. By that time, they will probably have initiated
                        routine submarine patrols within missile range of the US. (Paras. 64-68)</p>
                    <p>M. Soviet Long Range Aviation, by reason of its equipment, basing and
                        deployment, is much better suited for Eurasian operations than for
                        intercontinental attack. However, the Soviets have given considerable
                        emphasis to aerial refueling and to Arctic training. Excluding combat
                        attrition, we estimate that the Soviets could put about 200 aircraft over
                        North America on two-way missions; of these, about half would be heavy
                        bombers. Long Range Aviation now comprises about 170-200 <pb n="475"
                            xml:id="pg_475" facs="0507"/>heavy bombers and tankers and about 950 jet
                        medium bombers and tankers. We continue to estimate a gradual decline in
                        numerical strength. A portion of the Badger medium bomber force will be
                        replaced by the new supersonic Blinder, already in units, but our evidence
                        does not indicate that any new heavy bomber is being developed for
                        operational use. By mid-1967, Long Range Aviation will probably comprise
                        some 110-140 heavy bombers and about 750 mediums.<note n="5"

                            North American targets.</note> (Paras. 69-75)</p>

                            >USAF</gloss>, further estimates that a follow-on heavy bomber will
                        probably be introduced in about 1964. The continued development of large
                        aircraft capable of supersonic speed, and research in applicable materials,
                        structures, and other components substantiate the Soviets interest in large
                        supersonic vehicles and suggest an intent to increase their strategic attack
                        capability by such means. The Bounder probably has served a most useful
                        purpose as a test bed for many components, aerodynamic advancements, and a
                        structural design which are directly applicable to a follow-on heavy bomber
                        capable of supersonic speeds. He estimates the total Soviet heavy bomber and
                        tanker strength will remain at approximately 200 aircraft throughout the
                        period of this estimate, present strength levels being maintained by the
                        introduction of modest numbers of a new heavy bomber. [Footnote in the

                    <p>N. We estimate that the Soviet <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> force now comprises about 600
                        completed launch positions, deployed for the most part in western <gloss

                            >NATO</gloss> targets in Europe. The bulk of these launch positions are
                        soft, but a few silo-type hardened sites are probably operational. We
                        believe that deployment of soft sites will have been virtually completed
                        early this year, leveling off at about 600 launch positions; the hardened
                        component of the force will continue to grow, probably reaching about
                        100-150 launchers in mid-1964. It is possible that as many as half of the
                        soft launch positions are alternates, in which case the first salvo
                        capability of the force would be considerably smaller, although still large

                        its already formidable forces for strikes in Eurasia. Significant portions
                        of these forces will be relatively invulnerable to attack. The Soviets will
                        be in a position to strike pre-emptively at the fixed bases of an important
                        segment of the US nuclear delivery force, and they will have some prospect
                        that a portion of their own force could survive an initial US attack and
                        retaliate with high-yield weapons. With the forces <pb n="476"

                    <p>P. The significant improvements in the Soviet air defense system noted during
                        recent years will be extended during the next few years, and successful
                        penetration by manned bombers will therefore require increasingly
                        sophisticated forms of attack. The Soviet air defense capability can be
                        degraded by the increasingly complex forms of attack which the West will be
                        able to employ, including air-launched missiles of present and more advanced
                        types, penetration tactics, and electronic countermeasures. Even in such
                        circumstances, the Soviets would probably expect to destroy a number of the
                        attackers. We doubt, however, that they would be confident that they could
                        reduce the weight of attack to a point where the resulting da the <gloss

                        and uncertainties will sharply increase as ballistic missiles assume a
                        larger proportion of the West's total nuclear delivery capability. (Paras.

                    <p>Q. The major development which we foresee in Soviet defense is the advent of
                        a capability against ballistic missiles. For more than five years, the
                        Soviets have been conducting a high priority and extensive program to
                        develop antimissile defenses, and we estimate that several different <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems are under development. We believe
                        that in 1963 the Soviets will achieve some operational capability with an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system now being deployed around
                        Leningrad. We have no basis for determining its effectiveness, but doubt
                        that it would be effective against missiles employing decoys or other
                        countermeasures. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is probably also
                        developing an antisatellite system. (Paras. 83-84, 88)</p>
                    <p>R. To counter the more complex long-range ballistic missile threat of the
                        mid-1960's, the Soviets may seek to improve the Leningrad system, or may
                        develop a more advanced system, or both. In any case, the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is likely to defer additional <gloss

                        available. If the Soviets develop an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system which they regard as reasonably effective against long-range
                        missiles, a vigorous deployment program will probably be undertaken. We
                        believe that such a program would contemplate the defense of some 20-25
                        principal Soviet cities and would require some five or six years to
                        complete. We have no basis for judging whether or when the Soviets would
                        consider their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system effective enough
                        to warrant the initiation of such a program. (Paras. 85-86)</p>

                    <p>S. The longstanding Soviet concern with concepts and forces for campaigns in
                        adjoining theaters, especially in Europe, has resulted in a formidable
                        theater force, strong in armor, battlefield mobility, and units in being.
                        The tactical nuclear delivery capabilities of these forces are still
                        limited, but they have been improved markedly over the past few years. In
                        offensive operations, rapidly advancing theater forces would be in constant
                        danger of outrunning their logistical tail, which is heavily dependent on
                        railroads. Finally, the Soviets have traditionally exercised very strict
                        supervision over the actions of their subordinates, but existing command and
                        control systems do not permit this strict supervision over the widely
                        extended deployment required on the nuclear battlefield or under the threat
                        of use of nuclear weapons. (Paras. 106-124)</p>

                    <p>T. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s capabilities to conduct naval
                        warfare in the open seas rest primarily upon the submarine force, which is
                        capable of mounting a large-scale torpedo attack and mining campaign against
                        Allied naval targets and sea communications in the eastern North Atlantic
                        and northwestern Pacific. Its capabilities for operations near the
                        continental US are more limited, but are growing. Capabilities against
                        carrier task forces have been improved by the conversion of jet bombers to
                        employ anti-ship missiles, by the introduction of submarines equipped with
                        cruise-type missiles, and by increased air reconnaissance of open ocean
                        areas by Long Range and Naval Aviation. The Soviets have also placed
                        increasing emphasis on improvement of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>
                        forces in coastal areas and in the open seas. We believe the Soviet Navy is
                        capable of carrying out fairly effective <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>
                        operations in coastal areas, but that it has a negligible <gloss

                        effort which they almost certainly are devoting to this problem, we believe
                        that over the next five years, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        will be able to achieve only a limited capability to detect, identify,

                    <p>As you know, there has been considerable discussion in recent months of the
                        need for strengthening interdepartmental planning and coordination on major
                        national security issues. We made a major step forward at the time of the
                        October crisis when you established a working senior committee of advisers,
                        first by your de facto choice of individuals for the work of the first week,
                        and then by formally establishing the Executive Committee of the <gloss

                                (<persName>Kennedy</persName> Library, National Security Files,
                            Meetings and Memoranda Series, <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>
                            196) The 42 meetings of the Executive Committee were held through March
                            29, 1963, and were largely, although not exclusively, devoted to
                            Cuba.</note> The Executive Committee, with you and the Secretary of
                        State and the Secretary of Defense on hand, is a good instrument for major
                        interdepartmental decision. It is not so good for lesser matters of
                        coordination, and it has not proved effective at all, except during the
                        extraordinary week of October 16-22, in the process of forward planning.</p>
                    <p>I have talked at some length with the Secretary of State, the Attorney
                        General, Averell Harriman, and others, in an effort to find a new pattern
                        which would help in both planning and operations. I have come out with the
                        following guidelines: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>One new committee should be responsible for planning and
                                operations at the level short of your own controlling judgment. We
                                have done well in this Administration not to let planning get
                                separated from the responsibility for action, and vice versa. We
                                should not abandon this principle now.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The committee should be established at a sufficiently senior level
                                so that it is not merely a staff exercise. In my judgment, this
                                means that with four exceptions its membership should be parallel to
                                that of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. It
                                should include such men as the Secretary of the Treasury, the
                                Attorney General, Ed Murrow, <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John
                                    McCone</persName>, and probably Max Taylor. The people it should
                                not include, in my judgment, are the President and Vice President,
                                and the <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0511"/>two Cabinet
                                officers with a final responsibility for policy advice to you, the
                                Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. Neither of these
                                two Cabinet officers can speak in committee without engaging the
                                whole weight of a great advisory department, and both of them have
                                preferred not to be pinned to any procedure in which their direct
                                responsibilities to you might somehow be absorbed in a committee
                                process.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Plans and Operations Committee should be chaired from the
                                White House, presumably by me, but it should rely mainly upon State,
                                Defense, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> for staff work. For
                                this reason, it is of the greatest importance that the State
                                representative be a man with a broad and continuous operational
                                responsibility, but also with time and energy for this particular
                                assignment. I think it clear that the right man, on these grounds,
                                is Averell Harriman, using the Policy Planning Council for plans and
                                the several bureaus for operational problems. Of course, nothing
                                should prevent the presence at relevant sessions of any officer of
                                the State Department (on a number of problems <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> would probably wish to
                                come and on some the Secretary might want to break his own rule),
                                but it is critical to the success of such a committee that there be
                                a single senior member of the State Department to whom I can turn
                                for daily business, and on this basis, Averell is the logical man in
                                the logical job.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item><p>The committee should meet weekly, and it should have as little

                                less ripe than today's required decisions: like Cuba a year from

                                of ongoing programs with strongly interdepartmental aspects: I think
                                of overseas base planning, of counter-insurgency support, and of
                                information policy as examples. It should be used for the occasional
                                discursive review of drastic alternatives to existing policy, and
                                its members should be encouraged to table unorthodox ideas for such
                                review. It would be a logical plan [place?] for occasional review of
                                Intelligence estimates in progress, from the point of view of their
                                relevance to Plans and Operations.</item>

                            practical; hence, they do not think it desirable as a policy directive,
                            and would not increase strategic forces for attainment of this goal. The

                            capability is both feasible and desirable, both for deterrence and to
                            lessen the probability of defeat should general war occur. They

                        dated July 15, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                            >Kennedy</persName> wrote that he was “tremendously impressed with the
                        Special Forces Unit in West Germany. However, I am wondering if we are
                        making the best use of this unit?” <persName>Kennedy</persName> believed
                        that it was a “wasted effort” to keep this unit “where prospects of guerilla
                        action are very slight.” Instead “they could be demonstrating and training
                        all over the underdeveloped world where the guerilla actions are rising in
                        intensity.” A July 24 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName> to <persName>Kennedy</persName> noted that some of
                        the six existing Special Forces Units were already operating along the lines
                        suggested by <persName>Kennedy</persName>. One in Panama had “dispatched
                        Spanish speaking mobile training teams” to nine Central and South American
                        countries, and detachments from the one in Okinawa had conducted
                        demonstrations or counterinsurgency training in six Asian countries.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> concluded that “it would
                        appear that the worldwide program for the employment of Army Special Forces
                        is generally consistent with the desires which you have expressed in your
                        memorandum of July 15,” but that it was “probable more can be done and the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff will keep under review the adequacy and employment of
                        the Army Special Forces as well as Air Force Commando and Navy Units.”</p>
                    <p>On July 26, <persName>Kennedy</persName> sent a memorandum to <persName

                        impressed by the appearance and demeanor of the special forces I have seen
                        and believe that their presence in other countries can project a U.S. image
                        which will be a very useful political influence. To do so it is important
                        that the size of the cadres be sufficiently large to have an impact. Since
                        the judgment of our Ambassadors in the countries concerned will be dominant
                        in both the decision to introduce the forces and the decision as to their
                        size, I believe that you should send a letter to those Ambassadors in
                        countries where the forces are likely to be employed, calling attention to
                        the importance of these points.”</p>

                        which have proved so successful in many areas of the world in preventing and
                        combating subversive insurgency.” Additional suggestions by Ambassadors for
                        such training were “invited where applicable and practicable” and where
                        requested by the host government.</p>

                        “would not get anyone steamed up. It is not a sales job, and he feels it is
                        really a very routine response to what he really wants to do.” He “wants a
                        real sales job on why it is going to be so helpful to them, what a good face
                        forces can put on our nation, and how inspiring they are.” <persName

                            world military power, might nevertheless impel the Soviets to orbit a
                            nuclear weapon in the near term for demonstrative purposes. Such a move
                            would be more likely if the <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0519"

                            orbital bombardment force, or if convinced that the US was so committed.
                            However, in seeking to impress world opinion, they would also encounter
                            a variety of adverse reactions. Awe and alarm would be accompanied by
                            resentment and dismay, and it would be charged in many quarters that the
                            Soviets had extended the nuclear arms race into a new, more dangerous
                            area. The Soviets would have to consider whether it would serve their
                            interests to risk strong US countermoves, including an ambitious US
                            military space program, and a general intensification of the cold war.

                            exercise their technical capability at any time. (Para. 24)</item>

                            some form of US reaction. The Soviets would have to consider the
                            possibility of a US attempt to destroy their satellite, and if the US
                            threatened to do so, they would probably threaten retaliation against US
                            satellites. They would be wary, however, of the risks involved in direct
                            retaliation, including a possible “open war” on all satellites and the
                            accompanying dangers of escalation. Official and popular opinion in most
                            states allied with the US would expect and support US measures to
                            counter the Soviet action. Opinion in the nonaligned states would favor
                            some form of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> “solution.” The Soviets

                        <item>Based solely on considerations of cost and effectiveness as we now
                            understand them, it would appear unlikely that the Soviets will during
                            this decade deploy advanced orbital bombardment systems of military
                            significance. We recognize, however, that the Soviets might reach
                            different conclusions as to cost and effectiveness, or that other
                            factors might be more weighty. Moreover, considering the pace of
                            developments in the weapons field in general, it is extremely hazardous
                            to estimate Soviet decisions for a period many years ahead. For these
                            reasons, a firm estimate as to whether the Soviets will deploy an
                            advanced orbital bombardment system within the 1965-1970 period cannot
                            be made at this time. (Paras. 31-34, 45-49)</item>

                        <item>If the Soviets do proceed with an advanced orbital system, we believe
                            that they are more likely to seek a small force of limited effectiveness
                            than a very large and sophisticated one. The weapons of a small force
                            could be maintained continually in orbit or could be held on <pb n="488"

                            required. In any case, developmental testing of an orbital bombardment
                            system should be observable to us at least a year or two prior to
                            attainment of an accurate, reliable system. (Paras. 35-44, 50)</item>

                        studies would emphasize especially the smooth coordination of economic and
                        military aid. Two such studies were almost complete, but it was “not clear
                        at this point who would approve them. State would like to have them approved

                        Administration before the task was completed. He also commented that a paper

                            >Rostow</persName> had started with the idea of the strategic study as

                            sending the whole package to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>. When the drafts reached the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in late August, however, the Chiefs
                            decided to “note” the replies and not forward them to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, apparently on the ground
                            that it would be preferable to consider the six issues within the
                            context of the complete <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>. (Ibid.,
                            p.19)</note></p>
                    <p>Thus, so far as the Pentagon is now concerned the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1"
                            >BNSP</gloss> is dead.</p>
                    <p>As you know in this matter, as opposed to the conduct of specific planning
                        operations, I do not feel a sense of personal responsibility for pressing
                        the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> forward. I do believe, however,
                        that you and the President should consider seriously the following aspect of
                        the matter: the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> was first developed in
                        the Truman Administration and was carried forward in several editions in the
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration.
                        Whatever the limitations inherent in any such document, I doubt that it will
                        redound to the credit of our Administration that we failed to thrash out any
                        successor document. A <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> obviously cannot
                        substitute for specific policy judgments; and it should not tie the
                        President's hands. But it can provide an occasion for debating and defining
                        the bone structure of policy and communicating it to the troops who never
                        see the four star generals.</p>
                    <p>My first recommendation is, therefore, that you consider with the President
                        whether or not you wish to consider the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1"
                            >BNSP</gloss> exercise as finished.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to keep the matter open, we might consider what forms such a
                        document might take in the light of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName>'s views and the passage of time.</p>
                    <p>If you decide that we should abandon the exercise, you may wish to consider
                        what form a decent and unobtrusive burial might take; e.g., simply letting
                        it drift off; a <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> ordering suspension in
                        the light of fast-moving world events; etc.</p>
                    <p>But before accepting some form of the latter alternatives, I do urge you and
                        the President to pause for a moment on the prior question.<note n="5"

                        considerable amount of new information, mainly from photography. This
                        evidence leads us to believe that the Chinese, with Soviet assistance, had
                        embarked in the latter 1950s on a more ambitious advanced weapons program
                        than we had earlier thought likely. We further believe that they are still
                        working on that program though forced to slow its pace materially since
                        1960. Nevertheless, the gaps in our information remain substantial and we
                        are therefore not <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0525"/>able to judge the
                        present state or to project the future development of the Chinese program as
                        a whole with any very high degree of confidence. Specific judgments given
                        below about the stage likely to be reached by the Chinese program at
                        particular dates should be read in the light of this general caution.</p>

                            China, located at Pao-t'ou. This reactor probably could not have reached
                            criticality before early 1962. If it did go critical at that time, the
                            earliest a first device could be tested, based on plutonium from this
                            reactor alone, would be early 1964. If the Chinese run into even a
                            normal number of difficulties, this date would be postponed to late 1964
                            or 1965. If the reactor reached criticality later than early 1962—or has
                            not yet done so—the detonation would be even further delayed. Beginning
                            the year after a first detonation the reactor could produce enough
                            material for only one or two crude weapons a year. The Chinese have a
                            few bombers which could carry bulky weapons of early design. (Paras. 4-6
                            and 17)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>We believe that the eventual Chinese program calls for nuclear weapons
                            containing both U-235 and plutonium. Such a program would require more
                            plutonium production facilities than the one reactor that has been
                            identified. Neither photographic coverage nor other significant evidence
                            have disclosed another production reactor in China. The possible
                            existence of another reactor cannot be ignored however, nor the
                            possibility that one may be in production. We therefore cannot exclude
                            the possibility that the Chinese could achieve a first detonation at any
                            time. (Para. 7)</item>

                        <item>The gaseous diffusion plant at Lanchou will probably not be able,
                            under the most advantageous circumstances, to produce weapon-grade U-235
                            before 1966. Considering the great technical difficulties involved and
                            the large amount of additional construction needed, a more likely date
                            for such production is 1968-1969. (Paras. 2 and 3)</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>Peiping is probably concentrating initially on a medium-range
                            ballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>) system of
                            basically Soviet design, either the 630 mile SS-3 or the 1,020 mile
                            SS-4. We do not believe that missiles would be ready for deployment
                            before 1967. Because of the time and difficulties involved in producing
                            a missile-compatible warhead, we believe China is not likely to develop
                            such a warhead until 3 or 4 years after a first detonation. (Paras. 16
                            and 18)</item>

                        <item>The detonation of a nuclear device would boost domestic morale.
                            Although it is possible that the leadership would experience a dangerous
                            degree of overconfidence, we think it more likely that Peiping will
                            concentrate on furthering its established policies to: (1) force its way
                            into world disarmament discussions and other world councils; (2) overawe
                            its neighbors and soften them for Peiping-directed Communist subversion;
                            and (3) tout Chinese-style communism as the best route for an
                            underdeveloped nation to achieve industrial and scientific modernity. In
                            pursuing its policies, Peiping's increased confidence would doubtless be
                            reflected in its approach to conflicts on its periphery.<note n="2"

                    <p>I assume that after Mike Forrestal returns from vacation you, he, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> may get together
                        for your discussion on the scope and terms of reference of the Special Group
                            (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>). I therefore thought it might be
                        helpful for you if I set down some views on the subject, based on my
                        experience with the Group. First, some general comments:</p>
                    <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0527"/>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>The primary utility of the Group rests in its ability to obtain from
                            its members high-level policy decisions on our counter-insurgency effort
                            in the underdeveloped world and to do so rapidly and with a minimum of
                            formality.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Group is also effective in overcoming bureaucratic roadblocks
                            affecting high-priority projects in the <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs, and
                            in resolving interdepartmental policy differences without involving the
                            institutional prestige of the departments or agencies represented on the
                            Group.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The Group has also been successful in stimulating, developing, and
                            monitoring programs that either cut across departmental lines of
                            responsibility or require interdepartmental collaboration. Training for
                            counter-insurgency, civic action, and police assistance are examples of
                            this type of activity.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The weekly meetings of the Group provide a means for exercising close
                            and continuing control over policies and programs in nine or ten “crisis
                            countries” of the underdeveloped world.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) has developed an
                            institutional character and some measure of continuity, based on (a)
                            regular meetings; (b) forward planning of agendas; (c) dissemination of
                            minutes; and (d) systematic implementation of decisions. The quarterly
                            reviews of country Internal Defense Plans, together with periodic status
                            reports on training, civic action, police, etc., constitute the backbone
                            of its agendas.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>With these considerations in mind, it is evident that the Group exercises a
                        function quite different from other high-level interdepartmental committees,
                        such as the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Standing Group. It covers a
                        narrower range of subject matter but does so in greater depth and with more
                        continuity. The question that arises is whether the Group's activities are
                        useful and productive, or whether its work is becoming routine and sterile.
                        In my opinion, there is some indication that we are approaching a period of
                        diminishing returns.</p>
                    <p>First, the counter-insurgency or internal defense label applies in its
                        literal sense to a very small list of countries. Of the countries under
                        cognizance of the Group, there is an active left-wing insurgency threat only
                        in Vietnam, Laos, and Venezuela. Its application to other countries—both on
                        the Group's critical list and off it—represents in greater or lesser degree
                        a distortion of the concept. Colombia suffers from rural banditry; Ecuador,
                        Guatemala, and Boliva from chronic instability; the threat in Iran will most
                        likely take the form of an attempted coup; while in Thailand the threat is
                        from external infiltration as much as internal.</p>
                    <p>One consequence of rigid adherence to the counter-insurgency concept is that
                        the list of countries under the cognizance of the Group has remained
                        virtually frozen for eighteen months. This may be justifiable in Southeast
                        Asia, but in Latin America during the past year there have <pb n="496"
                            xml:id="pg_496" facs="0528"/>been revolutions, coups, abortive coups,
                        and serious internal upheavals in several Latin American countries not under
                        the Group's cognizance. In other geographic areas, there are serious
                        situations of unrest and violence that merit high-level interdepartmental
                        attention, if only on an ad hoc basis, but have not received it because they
                        are not “insurgency” situations. For example, there is not now any
                        high-level Government committee charged with coordinating our policies and
                        programs in certain key African and Middle Eastern countries where the
                        important factor is the political orientation of the government rather than
                        an insurgent or guerrilla threat. In ex-French Africa our military and
                        police assistance programs, which have been the subject of virtually
                        continual policy differences during the past year, could stand some
                        high-level interdepartmental attention. In the Middle East, the development
                        of interdepartmentally coordinated policies and programs for Syria and Iraq
                        is surely as important as continued surveillance over Guatemala, where the
                        insurgency threat has largely receded.</p>
                    <p>Another consequence of the counter-insurgency approach is that we have been
                        attacking such important programs as youth, labor, civic action and
                        psychological strategy through the back door. This is better than not
                        attacking it at all, but it distorts the true nature of the problem and may
                        cause us to focus on lower priority situations.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, this rather doctrinaire counter-insurgency approach to the problems
                        of underdeveloped countries has periodically created a feeling of uneasiness
                        on the part of Mike Forrestal, the Attorney General (and perhaps the
                        President too) that the Group is not coming to grips with the really
                        important issues. As you know, the President has on occasion asked why the
                        Group has not looked into such countries as Brazil. This feeling is likely
                        to be intensified if we are entering an era in which the nature of the
                        Soviet threat shifts to less aggressive but just as deadly forms of cultural
                        and economic penetration.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I believe that the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1"
                            >CI</gloss>) must develop a greater degree of flexibility if it is to
                        continue as an effective instrument of government. It must focus on problems
                        that require high-level attention. It should not go on indefinitely
                        monitoring the internal security programs of eight or ten countries. Nor
                        should it distort the complex problem of applying broad policies and
                        programs in youth, labor, information, etc. to crisis areas by labeling them
                        “counter-insurgency”.</p>
                    <p>What I believe we need to do is gradually convert the Special Group (<gloss
                            target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) to a “Special Group (Critical Areas)” with
                        terms of reference more flexible than we have now. As I see it, the Group
                        would then perform the following functions: <list>

                            <item>Limit its continuing surveillance functions to those countries
                                that face an immediate external or internal insurgency
                                threat—Vietnam, Venezuela, Thailand, and possibly Iran. (Drop
                                Colombia, Guatemala, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Laos.)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Establish a system of periodic spot surveillance over a wider
                                range of underdeveloped countries, concentrating on those where
                                severe unrest or Soviet penetration poses a critical threat to U.S.
                                interests. These countries would be placed under the Group's
                                cognizance for temporary periods as circumstances require, and kept

                    <p>If so broadened in purpose, a “Special Group (Critical Areas)” should operate
                        in much the same way that it does now. A small White House staff of one or
                        two officers would continue to be essential—not to recreate an <gloss
                            target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> or generate paperwork, but to assist State
                        in the forward planning of agendas and to flush out the problems that need
                        high-level exposure. (No single department or agency can accomplish the
                        latter.) As before, the primary purpose of the Group would be to expose
                        program deficiencies, overcome bureaucratic obstacles, and force decisions
                        on critical issues.</p>
                    <p>In writing the above I don't mean to imply that our counter-insurgency effort
                        has become “passe”. I do, however, think that the Group's efforts will
                        become less productive unless it recognizes that the Soviet threat in the
                        underdeveloped world may increasingly assume forms other than
                        insurgency.</p>

                    <p>Last November at Hyannis Port<note n="1" xml:id="d140fn1">The President was
                            in Hyannis Port for the Thanksgiving weekend, November 21-25, 1962. See
                                <ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note> I informed you that
                        we would restudy Titan III to see whether, despite its overlap with Saturn
                        C1/C1B in payload capacity, it seemed desirable to proceed. You will recall
                        that the Titan III program was justified, in part, on the grounds that the
                        cost per Titan launch would be so much less than per Saturn launch that the
                        savings over the life of the program would approximately offset the
                        development costs. The study of the costs and of the other elements of the
                        program has been carried out by the Air Force. At the same time, preliminary
                        development work has continued.</p>
                    <p>Since last Fall the contracts for Titan III have been finalized. Ninety-five
                        percent of the cost of the development program which has been negotiated is
                        represented by incentive contracts. This should be, and indeed is, a strong
                        influence in keeping the development cost close to the estimated total of
                        $875 million. Firing of 120“ rockets which in modified form will be used for
                        the strap on boosters has been carried out. Development of the other
                        components of the system has continued on schedule. We anticipate the first
                        test flight of the core (this includes the two stages based on the Titan II
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and the transtage) in August 1964
                        and of the full Titan III <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss> in April 1965.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the desirability of Titan III, I conclude that, on the basis
                        of the best estimates that can be made of its development cost, production
                        and launch cost, and reliability as compared to those of Saturn, and the
                        expected number of payloads in the 1966-75 period, Titan III will probably
                        very much more than pay for its development. Recognizing the uncertainties
                        in all of these factors, we have also examined the situation with some
                        assumptions less favorable to Titan III. Under these circumstances we
                        conclude that Titan III will nevertheless roughly pay for itself. I know
                        that others have made still more pessimistic estimates. However, even with
                        some slight economic deficiency, I believe the insurance that we purchase by
                        the Titan III development makes it a desirable investment. This insurance is
                        the capability to launch space payloads on very short notice or into narrow
                        time windows, and the possibility of converting Titan III into a weapon
                        system of large payload capacity, both of which are offered by its
                        combination of storable and solid fuels. Therefore <pb n="499"

                            in the United States would “increase over the years. Soviet damage and
                            capabilities will remain somewhat constant (because their capabilities
                            are increasing). Probably the major <gloss target="#t_NESC1"
                                >NESC</gloss> conclusion is that during the years 1964 through 1968
                            neither the US nor the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can emerge
                            from a full nuclear exchange without suffering very severe damage and

                            major issue. U.S. “offensive and defensive weapons currently programmed

                        <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0532"/>replied that it would be, i.e. even
                        if we preempt, surviving Soviet capability is sufficient to produce an
                        unacceptable loss in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether then in fact we are in a period of nuclear
                        stalemate. General <persName>Johnson</persName> replied that we are.</p>
                    <p>Referring to a statement of the Air Force Association which appeared in this
                        morning's Washington Post,<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">The statement was
                            printed in The Washington Post, September 12, 1963.</note> the President
                        asked how we could obtain nuclear superiority as recommended by the Air
                        Force Association. General <persName>Johnson</persName> said this was a very
                        difficult question to answer. He acknowledged that there is no way, no
                        matter what we do, to avoid unacceptable damage in the U.S. if nuclear war
                        breaks out. He later acknowledged that it would be impossible for us to
                        achieve nuclear superiority.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that Defense
                        Department studies showed that even if we spend $80 billion more than we are
                        now spending, we would still have 30 million fatalities in the U.S. in the
                        1968 time period, even if we made the first strike against the <gloss

                    <p>The President said these fatality figures were much higher than those he had
                        heard recently in Omaha.<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">See <ref target="#d118"
                                >Document 118</ref>.</note> As he recalled it, <gloss

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said these were higher
                        casualty figures than the President had ever seen. Today's figures include
                        two new factors: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                            <item>The use by the Soviets of huge megaton weapons was included in the

                        </list></p>
                    <p>The President said that de Gaulle believed that even the small nuclear force
                        he is planning will be big enough to cause unacceptable damage to the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He asked why we need to have as much
                        defense as we have if, as it appears, the strategy is based on the
                        assumption that even if we strike first we cannot protect the security of
                        the U.S. in nuclear warfare.</p>
                    <p>General <persName>Johnson</persName> replied that no matter what we do we
                        can't get below 51 million casualties in the event of a nuclear exchange. We
                        can, however, bring down this number by undertaking additional weapons
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if this doesn't get us into the overkill business.
                        General <persName>Johnson</persName> replied in the negative. We can cut
                        down U.S. losses if we knock out more Soviet missiles by having more U.S.
                        missiles and more accurate U.S. missiles. We estimate that we can save 20%
                        in megatonnage down in the U.S. if we can achieve more accurate missiles.
                        The <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0533"/>more Soviet missiles we can
                        destroy the less the loss to us. There is no question but that we can
                        increase the accuracy of our missiles. The Soviets are not competing with us
                        on numbers of missiles. They need, according to our calculation, only 1200
                        weapons. They, of course, can increase the megatonnage by enlarging the size
                        of their weapons.</p>
                    <p>General <persName>Johnson</persName> said that his personal conclusions from
                        this study were three: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>We have to get better weapons, especially anti-ballistic missile
                                weapons, to increase the number of Soviet missiles that we keep from
                                landing in the U.S.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>

                            <item>We must pay greater attention to chemical and biological warfare
                                weapons. The problem with such weapons to date has been that the
                                incubation period is three days, but conceivably could be brought
                                down to one day.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>General <persName>Johnson</persName> pointed out that each of the strategies
                        used against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> resulted in at least
                        140 million fatalities in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Our
                        problem is how to catch more of the Soviet missiles before they are launched
                        and how to destroy more of the missiles in the air over the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said there was no
                        way of launching a no-alert attack against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> which would be acceptable. No such attack, according to
                        the calculations, could be carried out without 30 million U.S. fatalities—an
                        obviously unacceptable number. Under conditions existing in 1968 with our
                        forces on the alert, only 300 warheads are used to produce the casualties in
                        the Soviet Union. Ninety-five percent of our force is for non-fatality
                        purposes. Thus, preemption today or in 1968 is not an acceptable course of
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the President
                        deserved an answer to his question as to why we have to have so large a
                        force. The answer lies in the fact that there are many uncertainties in the
                        equations presented in today's report. The factors included in the report
                        are probable, but they do not represent the entire range of possibilities.
                        By introducing pessimistic factors, the estimates given today are
                        drastically changed. He said the Defense Department and the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff are studying our current force level and they would be recommending a
                        force level to meet a reasonable anticipated situation. The Chiefs are now
                        considering the range of our weapons in relation to the range of anticipated
                        factors.</p>
                    <p>General <persName>Johnson</persName> said he had concluded from the
                        calculations that we could fight a limited war using nuclear weapons without
                        fear that the Soviets would reply by going to all-out war. He said that the
                        Russians have obviously made similar calculations, and, seeing the
                        unsatisfactory estimated results of an all-out nuclear war, would not
                        escalate a limited war even if we used tactical nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0534"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> called attention to the
                        deep schizophrenia involved in the present nuclear situation. If Congress
                        knew the conclusions presented in the report, the Administration could get
                        funds for aid and information programs which are the resources we must rely
                        on in our effort to prevent all-out nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> called attention to the fact
                        that this study and the existence of the sub-committee itself had been one
                        of the few government projects which had been kept secret.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> asked General
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> what he thought would happen to our
                        capability, if, in an arms agreement, we accepted a percentage reduction in
                        the number of our weapons. He doubted such a percentage cut would have much
                        effect. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed that we
                        would have to go very deep in an arms cut to have a substantial effect on
                        our capability. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said:
                        “That is, if the Russians honestly carry out a comparable cut.”</p>
                    <p>The President said he concluded from the report that the forces which will be
                        used under present circumstances are conventional, limited and tactical.
                        General <persName>Johnson</persName> agreed, adding that nuclear war is
                        impossible if rational men control governments.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said he agreed, but he
                        did not get much comfort from this fact because, if both sides believed that
                        neither side would use nuclear weapons, one side or the other would be
                        tempted to act in a way which would push the other side beyond its tolerance
                        level. He added that a response to pressure might be suicidal, being
                        prompted by a desire to get it over with. He referred to the current
                        situation as “This God Damn poker game.”</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> agreed that the
                        conclusions of the report did mean that there was a low possibility of
                        escalation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> repeated
                        his view that we can't assume that nuclear war won't happen and referred
                        again to suicidal tendencies. He wondered who else could be exposed to the
                        conclusions of the sub-committee.</p>
                    <p>The President again said that preemption was not possible for us and that
                        that was a valuable conclusion growing out of an excellent report.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> returned to the
                        subject of publicizing the conclusions of the report. He recalled that a
                        similar report three years ago indicated that we would be doing much more
                        damage to the Soviet Union than they would do to us. Today's report
                        indicated damage would be more nearly equal. Consequently, he thought that
                        it would be easier for us to make public the conclusions of this report.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said we could get out
                        the basic facts of the report without identifying it. Some of the
                        information was already in the public domain.</p>
                    <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0535"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> suggested that the
                        intelligence community should review the report before any decision is made
                        about making it public. He thought that the war game held on <gloss
                            target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> was better to use as a basis of judgment
                        because this war game dealt with an actual situation in the current
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The President thought that at some time we might consider making some of the
                        report available to some of the Congressional leaders.<note n="4"

                                1963</hi></p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—Is the level of damage we receive after we pre-empt
                            against the Russians unacceptable?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Yes (followed by a description
                            of the range of US fatalities resulting from the study through the years
                            1964 through 1968).</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—I have read the statement in this morning's paper by
                            the Air Force Association. What is meant by their reference to nuclear
                            superiority versus nuclear stalemate? How could you get superiority?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Stated he believed the members
                            of the Committee of the Air Force Association which drafted the
                            resolution did not have the facts as brought out in the report being
                            presented at this time. (The last subsidiary attack was explained.)</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>—Indicated he
                            had a study conducted examining the scale of fatalities after having
                            added 80 billion dollars to the defense budget for blast shelters,
                            increased weapons systems—both offensive and defensive. Under all of
                            these conditions in the 1968 time period, the minimum number of
                            fatalities was in excess of 30 million.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—At Omaha I remember being briefed that if we pre-empt
                            our casualties may be on the order of 12 million.</p>
                        <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0536"/>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>—That briefing
                            was related to the present <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—The variance rests in the difference in
                            targeting objectives of the Soviets. The weight of effort devoted to
                            urban industrial targets was the key to the variation in US casualties.
                            The results of the Omaha report were obtained by the Soviets firing
                            their retaliation counter force, this did not seem reasonable.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>—Does your study
                            deal with any effects other than the direct weapon effects—such as
                            disease, pestilence?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—No. However, the <gloss
                                target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> made a study of the long term effects
                            and basically concluded that not enough was known in this area. As a
                            consequence, a letter was sent to Dr. <persName>Johnson</persName>,
                            Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy, recommending
                            additional efforts to provide answers on long term effects.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d141fn7">Neither the study nor the letter to

                        <p>Speaker—President—Why do we need as much as we've got?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Explained the reason was to
                            reduce the damage and fatalities to our country. Improvement in US
                            systems is of particular importance. Also the development of an <gloss
                                target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defensive system would be of greatest
                            significance, particularly when deployed in an area such as the eastern
                            segment of the US where approximately 70% of the population is
                            concentrated.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—In the discussion the President asked about our
                            conclusions from the offset attack on 23 cities.</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Discussed the results of the
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—If we can't pre-empt and reduce fatalities, then what?
                            Why do we have as much as we've got? Doesn't it get into the overkill
                            business?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Indicated that the Soviet knows
                            without any doubt that we can destroy him due to the size of our force.
                            In effect, there should be no margin for error in his assessment of our
                            capabilities. Effort must now be expended to improve the systems in
                            reliability and accuracy. Certainly along with this is the importance of
                            multiple forces—bombers, SLBMs, <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s—to compound the Soviet problem. The statement on overkill
                            has been exaggerated since our expectancy of damage against the Soviet
                            time sensitive <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in 1964 was
                            calculated as no higher than 20%, whereas the 1968 estimate reached 70%.
                            If this expectancy were increased to 90%, the overall megatonnage down
                            on the US would be reduced by 20%.</p>
                        <p>Answer—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>—Gen.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>'s group has assumed probable planning
                            factors and they seem to me to be reasonable assumptions. They do not
                            represent all the possible factors so we must decide <pb n="505"
                                xml:id="pg_505" facs="0537"/>whether we are protecting ourselves
                            against pessimistic factors of Soviet capabilities. By assuming a range
                            of US forces we have calculated a range of US and Soviet fatalities.
                            Large changes in forces result in only small changes in fatalities.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—Why does he have a smaller force?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Soviet may consider he has
                            sufficient force with which to deter, especially when viewed in relation
                            to the scale of fatalities he is given the capability to produce in this
                            country. (Described manner in which assessments are carried out and
                            assistance rendered by NMCSSC.)</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Volunteered that he would be
                            very disturbed if the President considered this report indicated that we
                            could reduce our forces and/or not continue to increase to those
                            programmed. If a reduction should take place, the relative position of
                            the US and Soviets would become less in our favor. The President said he
                            understood.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Discussed the need for an
                            effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense; emphasis on Laser
                            and Casaba-Howitzer, intercepting sub-launched missile in boost phase.
                            Also brought in new efforts in chemical and biological warfare such that
                            biological warfare may be adaptable to strategic purposes.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>—What would be
                            the effect on casualties of incremental cuts in US and Soviet forces in
                            the event of arms reduction?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>—It would be
                            necessary to go very deep into the forces by such cuts before there
                            would be any significant effect.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—Would it be advantageous to tell the Soviets what
                            probable casualties may result from an exchange in order to convince
                            them of the possible outcome?</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>—This report is
                            one state secret which has been well kept and it would be a mistake to
                            cite figures from it. There would then be a precedent for someone to ask
                            about any comparable figures from next year's report.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>—I believe such
                            figures for casualties have already been made public. The President has
                            spoken of it on some occasions.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>—I think we
                            should ask the intelligence community how much information of this
                            nature has already gotten out (i.e., casualty figures). (Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> accepted the query and a review
                            of official US and Soviet statements will be made.)</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>—Asked about the
                            difference in results between a high state of alert and no alert.</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—This comparison was not made in
                            the study.</p>
                        <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0538"/>
                        <p>Speaker—President—What about pre-empt today with the Soviets in a low
                            state of alert?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>—(Today's
                            situation not actually answered.) In the many studies I have had done
                            for me I have not found a situation in which a pre-empt during a
                            low-alert condition would be advantageous. Under no circumstances have I
                            been able to get US casualties under 30 million. In fact, I have not
                            been able to get them down to 30 million. In 1968 we can have 3000
                            warheads and 5000 <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> on alert. Of this
                            force, 95 percent will be used in counterforce attacks or for purposes
                            other than to create casualties. They can destroy us with a few weapons
                            and we can do the same to them. Therefore, pre-empt is not advantageous
                            for either side.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>—The question
                            then is whether we are justified in continuing military targeting.</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Indicated this had to be
                            continued for the potential reduction it made in US casualties.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>—Gen. DeGaulle can
                            sit on the sidelines with five weapons and deter.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—Is that why DeGaulle is satisfied with a small
                            force?</p>
                        <p>Answer—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>—According to Gen.
                            DeGaulle, he can inflict unacceptable damage on anyone.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—DeGaulle is then using atomic weapons as a
                            trip-wire.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Gen. Peter Gallois
                                (French)<note n="8" xml:id="d141fn8">Pierre Gallois, former head of
                                the French Air Force.</note> told me, when I was stationed at <gloss
                                target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, that certain elements in France
                            believed that in time <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would
                            collapse and that the fight would be between the US and the Soviets. At
                            that time the French wanted to be able to sit on the side lines and say
                            to the Soviets—Don't touch us, if you do, it will cost you five
                            Hiroshimas.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—He believed this was probably correct and that DeGaulle
                            would not use nuclear weapons to defend Hamburg.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—Consider the study to be very good and helpful. Asked
                            how long worked on it and who composed the group.</p>
                        <p>Answer—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Explained the foregoing. Also
                            explained why today's force was not too large.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—This argues in favor of a conventional force.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Stated that he was convinced
                            from this report that you could resort to nuclear weapons in a limited
                            situation without it expanding into allout nuclear war.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0539"/>
                        <p>Speaker—President—I have been told that if I ever released a nuclear
                            weapon on the battlefield I should start a pre-emptive attack on the
                            Soviet Union as the use of nuclear weapons was bound to escalate and we
                            might as well get the advantage by going first.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—Gen. <persName>Johnson</persName>—Stated he did not consider this
                            necessarily true under the circumstances which exist.</p>
                        <p>Speaker—President—Since pre-emption does not show any advantage—and the
                            Russians also recognize this—it is possible that the US could use
                            tactical nuclear weapons in Laos without the Soviets assuming we would
                            also use them in Europe on the slightest provocation. (This is not an
                            assured understanding of the comment as made—it came in garbled in its
                            import and intent.)</p>
                        <p>The meeting was concluded by a discussion of the manner in which this
                            information could be released to Congressional groups. It was finally
                            agreed that the source (<gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss>) should be
                            protected and when the information is finally released, it should appear
                            as though originating from another agency.</p>

                        well use a psychiatrist around the table and in dealing with the world. This
                        is an interim effort by the Planning Council to make some shape of the

                    <p>What should we do about it?</p>
                    <p>I believe there are five elements which have converged to produce this
                        situation, of which one is basic, the other four being aspects of recent
                        developments.</p>

                        <item>There is, above all, the underlying fact that the historical trend in
                            our time is towards the diffusion of effective power away from both
                            Moscow and Washington. Although that diffusion is least marked in
                            nuclear affairs, it evidently extends to the nuclear problem, given
                            current French and U.K. policies and attitudes; Chinese Communist
                            policy; and stirrings elsewhere towards command over nuclear arms. But,
                            while nuclear weapons are enormously destructive, they can be used
                            rationally only in very narrow circumstances and as a tool of diplomatic
                            pressure only under special circumstances. Thus, despite the
                            concentration of nuclear power in the U.S. and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, effective diplomatic, political, and
                            economic power continues its trend towards diffusion. This does not mean
                            that we are incapable of influencing the shape of events by means of our
                            military and economic power and through political leadership. It does
                            mean that we must increasingly work by organizing diffuse centers of
                            power and influence within the Free World rather than by decisions made
                            cozily in Washington. The problem is most pronounced in our relations
                            with Western Europe, but extends to Japan, Latin America, and the other
                            less developed areas. The trend is, of course, masked at moments of
                            acute East-West confrontation, such as the Berlin and Cuba missile
                            crises of last year. But all our dispositions must take into account

                        <item>This underlying tendency is, of course, reinforced and brought to the
                            surface by the easing of tensions which followed our successful dealing
                            with the Berlin and Cuban crises of last year. As indicated above, a
                            U.S.-Soviet confrontation reestablishes the surface, at least, of
                            bipolarity, since such confrontations are tests of will in the shadow of
                            relative nuclear capabilities which only we and the <gloss

                            emerged successfully from such nuclear tests of will <pb n="509"
                                xml:id="pg_509" facs="0541"/>over Berlin and Cuba. There is a real
                            sense in which we are now facing the consequences of our success last
                            year.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Quite aside from the easing of tensions, our engagement with the
                            Soviet Union in even superficially amicable negotiations, even over a
                            very narrow range (such as the test ban), stirs two images around the
                            world which reinforce the natural impulse of nations to pursue what they
                            conceive to be their national advantage, in old-fashioned regional
                            terms. First, the image that the U.S. and the Soviet Union may get
                            together at their expense to protect themselves from the dangers of
                            assertive nationalism in general and nuclear weapons in particular. The
                            second image is that, perhaps, the cold war is on the way to its end;
                            that U.S. concern with the rest of the world is declining; and that the
                            restraints, disciplines, and intrusions on conventional nationalism are
                            being (and can safely be) withdrawn or diminished.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>There is the reduced fear of communism on the international scene
                            brought about by the setback to Khrushchev in his various post-Sputnik
                            adventures and, despite Peking's big talk, by the growing sense in some
                            parts of the world that Communist China is a relatively weak state in
                            power terms, although the fear of Communist China remains strong in
                            South and Southeast Asia. There is, in short, rightly or wrongly, a
                            simple reduction in fear of communism.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Finally, there is the fact of the Sino-Soviet split. The split has
                            reduced the pretensions and vitality of communism as a doctrine and an
                            international movement; but it has, to a degree, also reshaped the arena
                            of world power. We have tended to look at it in terms of Peking's more
                            aggressive ideological line and in terms of Peking's unwillingness to
                            sign the test ban treaty while pursuing a national nuclear capability.
                            The other side of the medal is, of course, that Communist China,
                            increasingly detached from Russia, assumes the form of just another
                            nation in an increasingly diffused arena of world power. And other
                            nations see the possibility of using relations with this increasingly
                            detached China as a means to advance parochial national interests.
                            Within the Bloc, Rumania and Cuba, as well as Albania, have played this
                            game; outside the Bloc, we can see Japan and Pakistan looking at China
                            from this new perspective—and, in a corner of their minds, even France
                            and Canada. Moreover, the Chinese Communists' effort to reduce their
                            dependence on Moscow has produced a reciprocal Chinese movement to
                            strengthen their national position on the world scene by widening trade
                            and other contacts with the non-Communist world, excepting the United
                            States. This is yielding an increased dependence on the West which, in
                            fact, may prove, in the short and middle term, a more meaningful fact
                            than Peking's tough ideological language or even the possibility of its
                            acquiring some kind of nuclear capability, given the realities of
                            China's economic situation over the foreseeable future and the real
                            nature of modern military technology as opposed to a nuclear
                            explosion.</item>
                    </list>
                    <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0542"/>
                    <p>Taken all together, these five factors have appeared to yield, within a
                        relatively few months after the Cuban missile showdown, a quite remarkable
                        appearance of fragmentation in both blocs; although, as I say, what is
                        really involved is the emergence of a situation which permits the underlying
                        trend towards power diffusion to assert itself more strongly than it was
                        permitted to do in the tenser atmosphere of 1961-62. Specifically, the
                        situation poses for us the danger of diluting the unity of the Free World;
                        releasing local enmities which could yield dangerous regional conflicts;
                        opening up opportunities for communist exploitation; etc.</p>
                    <p>Now, in broad terms, what do we do about it?</p>
                    <p>First, we must husband all those levers of influence which permit us to
                        exercise that degree of continuing control over a still dangerous
                        environment necessary to protect our vital interests. We should not, of
                        course, struggle against every manifestation of this diffusion of power. It
                        has many elements of potential advantage to us. And, besides, (in
                        Khrushchev's phrase about his Eastern European satellites) quite a few
                        countries are “getting too big to spank.” But we need to keep it under
                        tolerable control in certain directions. We need, therefore, to look at our
                        military capabilities more clearly as a double asset: a continuing deterrent
                        against communist adventures, but also—and equally—as an essential element
                        in maintaining minimum stability in parts of the world which are inherently
                        explosive if left to themselves; e.g., Korea, Southeast Asia, the Indian
                        subcontinent, the Middle East, important areas in Africa, parts of Latin
                        America and Germany. In the latter case it is evident that the maintenance
                        of the Germans on a collective course with the U.S. and the West hinges
                        critically on the continued effective military presence of the U.S. side by
                        side with them. Despite balance of payments pressures and despite the
                        temptations of a period of detente, we must be more explicit than we have in
                        the past in recognizing and accepting this second stabilizing role of the
                        U.S. military presence, in the form of useable force, in every part of the
                        world. Similarly, we must struggle against all difficulties to maintain the
                        foreign aid lever in our hands or strongly under our influence (as through
                        the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, Alliance for Progress
                        institutions, etc.). It is a simple fact, largely unappreciated, that the
                        dependence of many countries on U.S. foreign aid (including their dependence
                        on PL 480 for the feeding of decisive urban populations) is an essential
                        damper on nationalist emotions and policies which, without that damper,
                        could easily rip open many regions of the world, producing results damaging
                        in themselves and opportunities for Communist exploitation.</p>
                    <p>Second, against this background of useable power and influence, we must
                        dramatize before our own people and the world the limits of the detente.
                        Here Khrushchev has helped us by his reiteration of the theme that there
                        shall be no ideological coexistence. We should explain what that means in
                        terms of other forms of Communist enterprise. I am thinking here not merely
                        of the continued violence of communism in parts of <pb n="511"
                            xml:id="pg_511" facs="0543"/>Latin America but the insidious effects of
                        detente on Italian and Greek domestic politics—a kind of making local
                        communism respectable. We may face in post-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                            Gaulle</persName> France a serious form of this softening in the
                        domestic political fiber of the West. Similarly, we should not miss that
                        element in Moscow's debate with Peking which asserts that a period of
                        detente and peaceful coexistence will heighten the “inner contradictions” of
                        the West. They are counting on divisions within the Alliance and on their
                        systematic exploitation. It is our duty, then, to educate the Free World,
                        within our limits, to the dangers and problems of an atmosphere of detente
                        as well as to the enjoyment and exploitation of its real advantages and
                        possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Third, on the constructive side, despite the difficulties, we must press
                        forward with all those enterprises which would bind together regions of the
                        West in collective enterprises. Despite <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                            Gaulle</persName>, there is a great deal to do in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which can be done and which the detente
                        does not necessarily preclude; for example, the <gloss target="#t_MLF1"
                            >MLF</gloss>; movement towards a common strategy; intensified political
                        consultation both on East-West matters and on problems within the Free World
                        outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (e.g., the implications for
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> of the Chicom acquisition of
                        nuclear weapons); work on trade, monetary affairs, aid, etc. The impulses
                        within Latin America to make something serious out of the Alliance for
                        Progress are, I believe, stronger than we often think. There is work to be
                        done on the organizational side of the Alliance for Progress and in giving
                        to it a more vital and effective strategy. In the Pacific there is the
                        impulse of Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Malaya to take
                        a greater hand in their own fate; and we have the capacity to help organize
                        these impulses instructively. Over a period of time we have, of course, both
                        the challenge and the possibility of making something more stable out of the
                        Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. The general point is that in the
                        Free World—and here we have a marked advantage over the Communist bloc as
                        presently organized—the atmosphere of detente and the assertion of more
                        familiar nationalist impulses does not eliminate all the areas of common
                        interest within the West, nor does it preclude continued movement forward in
                        joint ventures which would, in effect, organize the world of diffusing power
                        into a world of diffused responsibility.</p>
                    <p>There are two other major dimensions of policy which evidently flow from the
                        present state of the world: the art of playing the diffusion of power within
                        the Communist world in ways which advance our interests; and the problem of
                        maintaining at home an understanding of this new environment—its problems
                        and possibilities—and the effective will to deal with it. This is a more
                        subtle and difficult—if essentially more wholesome—environment than the
                        eyeball-to-eyeball world of 1961-62. We shall leave prescription under these
                        two headings for the later <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> effort.</p>

                                military presences” and accepting that foreign aid would be
                                increasingly economic, not military, thereby seeking “controlled
                                instability through policies accepting and encouraging moderate
                                change.” An alternative would be to attempt to maintain the bipolar
                                world by allocating enormous resources to the East-West conflict,
                                with the objective of bringing about collapse of the “Bloc” through
                                economic overstrain. “Given our American ethic, the first

                        <item>The Soviet leaders look upon long range strike forces as a major
                            element of their strategic position, intended to support their political
                            objectives, to deter the West from resort to military action, and to
                            fight a war should one occur. The available evidence supports the view
                            that they are attempting to build forces which they regard as
                            appropriate to these objectives rather than forces with which they could
                            launch a deliberate attack on the West and count on reducing retaliation
                            to levels that would be in any sense tolerable. (Paragraph 34)</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Current Soviet military doctrine holds that a general war could begin
                            with little or no warning, stresses the critical importance of the
                            initial period in determining its outcome, and asserts that enormous
                            advantages accrue to the side striking the first blow. However, the
                            official doctrine also holds that the initial nuclear exchange might not
                            determine the outcome, and that in any event large theater forces are
                            necessary to prosecute a general war successfully. These views, when
                            related to the strategic capabilities now deployed and programmed by the
                            West, impose high and complex requirements upon the Soviet military
                            establishment. Among the chief constraints in meeting these requirements
                            are cost and skilled manpower. The Soviet strategic posture has also
                            been heavily influenced by a concentration on the Eurasian theater, and
                            by an apparent lag in military thinking on the implications of advanced
                            weapons. Soviet military policy and doctrine have been considerably
                            modified in recent years, and the process of change is continuing.
                            However, for the immediate future, Soviet forces for long range attack
                            will be characterized by capabilities against Eurasia far exceeding
                            those against North America. (Paragraphs 35-37)</item>

                            Evidence acquired during the past year has led us to modify our
                            estimates as to the size and composition of the Soviet <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force in the near term. The most
                            important single development was the interruption of the deployment
                            program during the summer and fall of 1962. The primary reasons for this
                            interruption appear to have been technical, including a probable
                            modification to the second-generation SS-7 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss> system and persisting difficulties in development of
                            the SS-8. Whatever the reason, however, it is clear that 1962 was a year
                            of reappraisal, in which Soviet planners apparently made important new
                            decisions with respect to their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            program. Some of these, for example curtailment of SS-8 deployment, are
                            already evident. For the near term, the result is a somewhat smaller
                            force than previously estimated. (Paragraphs 39-40)</item>

                        <item>Of the three Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> systems now
                            in the field, the SS-7 has been the most successful in development and
                            is the most widely deployed. Deployment of the large, first generation
                            SS-6 was limited to four launchers at one complex. Deployment of the
                            SS-8 had extended to four complexes before the program was interrupted.
                            However, SS-8 deployment has now been curtailed, and it is believed that
                            expansion of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force over the

                            about mid-1965. We now believe that the SS-8 which we previously
                            considered might be a very large missile, is comparable to the SS-7 in
                            payload capacity.<note n="4" xml:id="d144fn4">The Director, Defense

                        <item>We continue to have difficulty in understanding the Soviet rationale
                            for building such a massive capability to attack European targets. One
                            factor influencing Soviet decisions was undoubtedly the strategic
                            emphasis on Europe, and the concept of a hostage Europe probably played
                            a part. Soviet planning to strike a wide variety of targets, including
                            some in support of the theater forces, may also have exerted an upward
                            pressure on the size of the force, particularly if most of these
                            missiles were to be equipped with kiloton warheads. Finally, a
                            contributing military factor may have been a desire to attain
                            survivability through numbers. (Paragraph 65)</item>

                            are primary firing positions, i.e., positions which are manned and
                            equipped to participate in an initial salvo. There has been much
                            evidence that the Soviets intend to provide a substantial refire
                            capability for this force, and our evidence on missile production
                            indicates that, by mid-1965, each soft site could have a second-salvo
                            missile available. The same operational deficiencies which characterize
                            the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force—vulnerability,
                            slow reaction time, and cumbersome procedures—appear in Soviet <gloss

                            deployment of a part of the force in hard silos. A further improvement
                            may be made by introduction of an improved missile system. We believe
                            that a new <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> could be operational in

                        <item>Submarine Missile Forces. Current Soviet submarine missile forces are
                            the outgrowth of decisions taken in the middle 1950's to develop quickly
                            a fairly extensive but unsophisticated capability. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has about 50 ballistic missile
                            submarines, including 11 of the nuclear-powered H class; all are
                            equipped with short range (350 n.m.) missiles capable of delivering
                            warheads [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]. The mission originally envisaged for these
                            submarines probably <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0549"/>included
                            participation in initial strategic attacks. However, they have now
                            evidently been assigned to second-strike roles, partly because of the
                            growth in numbers of ground-launched systems, but probably also because
                            of Soviet recognition of their limitations. Although this force
                            represents a considerable potential threat, its operational
                            effectiveness is limited by the small number of missiles per submarine
                            (2 or 3), the short range of the missiles, the need to surface before
                            launching, the operational limitations of the diesel-powered units, and
                            the unreliability of some nuclear powered units. These shortcomings
                            probably account for the continued absence of essential operational
                            training cruises to likely combat areas. (Paragraphs 74-76)</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>There is evidence that the Soviets recognize these deficiencies and
                            that improved missiles and submarines will become operational in the
                            near future. Development is far advanced on a new 700 n.m. ballistic
                            missile designed for submerged launching. This missile will almost
                            certainly be incorporated in any new class of ballistic missile
                            submarine which appears in the near future; it could possibly be
                            retrofitted into existing types as well. While we have no direct
                            evidence, it seems probable that at least one new submarine class
                            (either nuclear or diesel-powered) is under development to employ the
                            new missile and that the first units could enter service in the near
                            future. It is likely that new designs will incorporate more than the
                            three missile tubes carried by the older classes. We estimate that by
                            mid-1965 the Soviet force of ballistic missile submarines will have
                            grown to a total of 55-65, including some 15-20 nuclear-powered
                            submarines. (Paragraphs 86-87, 88-89)</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>In addition to ballistic missile submarines, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has operational some 19
                            submarines capable of surface launching 300 n.m. cruise missiles. Six of
                            these are nuclear-powered E class, each equipped with six launchers; the
                            rest are diesel-powered units equipped with two or four launchers each.
                            This system was designed primarily for low altitude (1,000-3,000 feet)
                            attack on ships at sea, but it can also be employed against land
                            targets. We believe that the Soviets may now be placing additional
                            emphasis on the cruise missile submarine program. We estimate that by
                            mid-1965 this force will have grown to 25-30 submarines, including 10-12
                            nuclear-powered. (Paragraphs 82-85, 88-89)</item>

                        <item>Thus, we believe that in the near future the Soviets will bring into

                            Further, we continue to believe that by the mid-1960's at least some
                            Soviet missile submarines will be engaging in routine patrols in open
                            ocean areas. (Paragraphs 75, 90- 93)</item>

                            role of Long Range Aviation, and the use of both heavy and medium
                            bombers in this role has been increasing. (Paragraph 94)</item>
                        <label>16.</label>
                        <item>We estimate that Long Range Aviation comprises about 180-205 heavy
                            bombers and tankers and 940-975 medium bombers and tankers. The heavy
                            bomber force includes 95-105 Bison jet bombers and 85-100 Bear turbo
                            prop bombers. Of the medium bombers, about 40-50 are Blinders, with
                            supersonic dash capability, and the remainder are Badgers. There are an
                            additional 360-370 Badgers and 10-20 Blinders in Naval Aviation. Blinder
                            is the only bomber known to be in current production, but there are
                            indications that there may be some new production of Bear in addition to
                            modification. Although research and development on heavy aircraft is
                            under way, no replacement for Bear or Bison is in sight, and we consider
                            it highly unlikely that a new heavy bomber could enter inventory before
                            1966. We estimate that in mid-1965 Long Range Aviation will comprise
                            170-200 heavy bombers and tankers and 825-925 medium bombers and

                        <item>Soviet Long Range Aviation, by reason of its equipment, basing, and
                            deployment, is much better suited for Eurasian operations than for
                            intercontinental attack. The capabilities of the Bison and Badger
                            aircraft which make up the bulk of the force are restricted by their
                            limited range. The emphasis on aerial refueling and Arctic training of
                            the past several years reflect Soviet efforts to overcome this
                            limitation on capabilities for intercontinental attack. (Paragraphs

                        <item>In view of the training patterns of recent years, the capacity of the
                            principal Arctic staging bases, and the range capabilities of Soviet
                            bombers, we believe that an aircraft attack against the US (except
                            Alaska) would involve heavy bombers almost exclusively. Considering the
                            requirements for Arctic staging and refueling, and allowing for
                            non-combat attrition, we estimate that, by committing their entire heavy
                            bomber force to this mission, the Soviets could put 90-115 of these
                            aircraft over the US on two-way missions. The scale of an initial
                            intercontinental attack could be increased by the use of refueled
                            Badgers on two-way missions. Considering all operational factors, we
                            estimate that the Soviets could put up to 150 of these medium bombers
                            over target areas in Greenland, Canada, Alaska and portions of

                                500. See his footnote to pages 22, 23, paragraph 102 of the

                        <item>No well-defined strategic concept appears to have governed the long
                            range strike forces which the Soviets have deployed to date, but a
                            number of characteristics can be discerned in the building of these
                            forces. Research and development programs have been vigorous. In
                            contrast, the scale and pace of deployment programs have been uneven.
                            This behavior has reflected, in part, technical problems and economic
                            constraints, but it also suggests that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is willing to tolerate a condition of limited
                            intercontinental capabilities and considerable vulnerability over a long
                            period of time. (Paragraph 125)</item>

                        <item>Perhaps the most consistent patterns apparent in Soviet policy toward
                            long range strike forces over the past several years are to be found in
                            the increased allocation of resources to this mission, the numerical
                            expansion of these forces, the improvement of various weapon systems for
                            long range attack, emphasis on high yield weapons, and continuing
                            interest in diversified capabilities. During this period, emphasis has
                            shifted from weapon systems best suited for Eurasian use to
                            intercontinental systems. Our estimates for the next two years suggest,
                            in the main, a continuation of these broad trends. The forces which we
                            project for mid-1965 are stronger, both numerically and qualitatively,
                            but they represent no substantial change in the overall strategic
                            posture of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> vis-à-vis the West.

                        <item>The prospects for the later 1960's are far less clear. We believe that
                            the desire for an effective deterrent will remain one of the primary
                            concerns of Soviet policy. None of the evidence available to us
                            suggests, however, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            contemplates forces designed to neutralize US strike forces in a single
                            blow, nor do the Soviets appear to be seeking to match the US in numbers
                            of delivery vehicles. Other programs, particularly strategic defense and
                            space, will continue to compete with strategic attack programs, not only
                            for resources but for scarce skills and quality materials. In general,
                            we believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would have
                            great economic difficulty in pursuing a policy which called for
                            antimissile defenses of major cities, competition with the US in space,

                        <item>Soviet long-range strike forces could also be heavily affected by
                            political factors. In the present and prospective strategic situation
                            which confronts the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, there is much
                            which argues for a policy of safeguarding national security through some
                            fairly moderate level of military strength or even, more radically,
                            through international agreements to limit or reverse the arms race.
                            Moreover, Khrushchev's advocacy of higher priority for certain civilian
                            economic programs appears to be growing stronger. These political and
                            military considerations suggest, not that the Soviets will cut back on
                            their strategic programs, but rather that they are unlikely to undertake
                            large-scale programs on a crash basis. Indeed, current trends in
                            development and deployment indicate that in the absence of an arms
                            limitation agreement, the Soviets will continue improving their
                            capabilities, but at a moderate pace. In framing the estimates which
                            follow, we have attempted to take into consideration the various
                            factors—strategic, economic, military, political, and technical—which
                            could influence the size and composition of Soviet long range strike

                                    Soviets might find it feasible to incorporate hardening at some
                                    stage in the program. (Paragraph 144)</item>

                                    Soviets would consider the primary qualitative improvements

                                    These requirements can probably be met almost as well, and at
                                    much lower cost, by improvement to the SS-7 as by a follow-on

                                    Minuteman would run counter to trends thus far discernible in
                                    Soviet long range missile systems, and Soviet technology
                                    necessary for large grain solid propellants is weak. However,
                                    some of the operational attributes of the Minuteman concept
                                    would reduce the main deficiency in the Soviet force—namely its
                                    vulnerability to US attack—and might also reduce maintenance
                                    requirements. A new missile somewhat smaller than SS-7 and using
                                    improved propellants could reach operational status during the
                                    period. We believe it likely that such a new smaller missile
                                    would be deployed in hard sites. We believe that test firings of
                                    such a new smaller missile would not start for about a year and
                                    that operational launchers would not exist at deployed sites
                                    until 1966-1967. Should the Soviets elect to deploy a new
                                    missile in soft or semi-hard sites, test firings could begin in
                                    the near future, with an initial operational capability
                                    occurring in about mid-1965. (Paragraphs 147-148)</item>

                            launch sites will cease by the mid-1960s. The low side of our estimate
                            for 1969 (400 launchers) assumes that, in addition to deployment of a
                            few very large <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s which begin to
                            enter operational inventory in mid-1966, the Soviets will at about the

                        <item>The high side of our estimate for mid-1969 (700 launchers), takes into
                            account the possibility that the deployment of soft launchers, perhaps
                            including some semi-hardened sites, is carried somewhat further than in
                            the preceding alternative; that a very large system is introduced
                            somewhat earlier than 1966; and that over 200 launchers of a new type—an

                            about 700-750 launchers. The developments which we can foresee in
                            Western forces are not likely to add to potential Soviet <gloss

                            would result in some incremental expansion. Improvements in Soviet

                                >IRBM</gloss> capabilities in this period are more likely to be
                            qualitative than quantitative. The Soviets may be developing a new

                            also contemplate a new <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. If two

                                >IRBM</gloss> would probably phase in a year or so after the <gloss

                            possible that the Soviets have elected to work toward a single follow-on
                            system which could cover all <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> and

                            adjunct to their ground-launched missile capabilities, and we expect the

                            continue. Thus we estimate continued construction of both ballistic
                            missile and cruise missile submarines in this period. Although we have

                            could become operational in about the 1966-1967 period. We do not
                            anticipate significant technical changes in the cruise missile submarine

                        <item>The size of Soviet missile submarine forces will depend upon a number
                            of factors including the availability of militarily competitive but less

                            improved systems, we believe that by 1969 the Soviets will have 65-80
                            ballistic missile submarines operational, of which 25-35 will be
                            nuclear-powered. At that time, we estimate a cruise missile submarine
                            force of 40-60 of which 20-30 will be nuclear-powered. (Paragraph

                        <item><hi rend="italic">Long Range Bombers</hi>. We estimate that by 1969
                            Long Range Aviation will have gradually declined in total strength to
                            about 130-175 heavy bombers and tankers and 400-650 medium bombers and
                            tankers. We believe that it will still consist of aircraft types now in
                            service: Bisons, Bears, Badgers, and Blinders, with the last of these
                            comprising about half of the medium bomber force. Considering the types
                            and quantities of missile delivery systems they are likely to have, as
                            well as the probable continued availability of existing heavy bomber
                            types, we think it unlikely that the Soviets will bring any follow-on
                            heavy bomber to operational service in the period of this estimate.
                            However, the Soviets have the technical capability of developing and
                            producing new, high-performance military aircraft of intercontinental
                            range for operational use in the 1966-1969 period, should they come to
                            consider this necessary or worthwhile. In the later 1960s they would
                            probably employ bomber forces in follow-on, rather than initial attacks
                            and for increasingly specialized missions.<note n="9" xml:id="d144fn9"

                                since he thinks that the Soviets will continue to consider manned

                                further estimates the heavy bomber force will remain at about 200 or
                                somewhat larger, depending on the timing of an expected follow-on
                                bomber, and that by mid-1969 the medium bomber/tanker force probably
                                still will include about 900 aircraft. See his footnote to the Table

                        <item>Space Weapons. On the basis of evidence presently available, we are
                            unable to determine the existence of Soviet plans or programs for the
                            military use of space. However, we believe that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly is investigating the
                            feasibility of space systems for military support and offensive and
                            defensive weapons. For accomplishing military missions, we think that
                            during the 1966-1969 period, orbital weapons w<pb n="524"
                                xml:id="pg_524" facs="0556"/>ill not compare favorably with <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in terms of cost and effectiveness.
                            Based on these considerations as we now understand them, it would appear
                            unlikely that the Soviets will during this decade deploy orbital
                            bombardment systems of military significance. Moreover, we believe that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably recognize that
                            a Soviet deployment of nuclear weapons in space would produce an
                            unfavorable reaction in other countries and strong US counteractions.
                            Further, if the Soviets enter into a formal obligation to refrain from
                            orbiting nuclear weapons, this will constitute still another factor
                            inhibiting such deployment. (Paragraphs 168-171)</item>

                        <item>We recognize, however, that the Soviets might reach different
                            conclusions as to cost and effectiveness, and in some future phase of

                            effectiveness. Moreover, considering the pace of developments in the
                            weapons field in general, it is extremely hazardous to estimate Soviet
                            decisions for a period many years ahead. For these reasons, a firm
                            estimate as to whether the Soviets will deploy an orbital bombardment
                            system within the 1966-1969 period cannot be made at this time.

                            requirements upon Soviet long range strike forces. Among the chief
                            constraints in meeting these requirements are cost and skilled manpower,
                            which pose distinct problems to Soviet decision-makers. One of these

                            space program, and the civil economy. Another is the proper allocation
                            of military funds among the various force components. This problem is
                            made particularly acute by the insistence of the military leadership
                            that all arms of service, including large theater forces, are necessary

                        <item>Two other main factors have been involved in the past decisions which
                            have determined present Soviet capabilities for long range attack. One
                            is a concentration on the Eurasian theater, which is traceable to
                            traditional Soviet preoccupation with this area as well as to the higher
                            costs and greater technical complexity of intercontinental weapon
                            systems. The other is an apparent lag in military thinking, which seems
                            to have been relatively slow in working out some of the more
                            sophisticated implications of advanced weapons. Both these factors are
                            now changing, but for the immediate future Soviet forces for long range
                            attack will be characterized by capabilities against Eurasia far
                            exceeding those against North America, and by a considerable deficiency
                            in certain performance characteristics—chiefly survivability and

                    <p>Our program for strategic defense is approaching a threshold where a major
                        national decision should be made whether to base our strategic posture
                        primarily on strong offensive forces or to provide the elements of a
                        balanced defense against a nuclear attack. A choice between these
                        fundamental alternatives involves the following arguments: <list>
                            <label>(a)</label>
                            <item>Our strategic offensive forces, alone, should deter a calculated
                                Soviet first strike. Additional offensive forces would contribute
                                most to defense by reducing the probability of general nuclear
                                attack. The nation may not be willing to provide the resources for
                                an expanded strategic defense program, including the requisite civil
                                defense, in view of the limited effectiveness of such a program.
                                Moreover, a level of defense that threatened the credibility of the
                                Soviet deterrent would probably be countered, at some fraction of
                                the cost of the defense, by additional expenditures for offensive
                                weapons.</item>
                            <label>(b)</label>
                            <item>A nuclear war, however, may result from other conditions—an
                                accident, an uncontrolled attack by a Soviet field commander, a
                                catalytic attack by a third nation, or from a deep crisis in which
                                the Soviets act irrationally or are willing to accept greater
                                damage. Balanced defense forces would significantly raise the level
                                of attack that would cause serious damage under such, probably most
                                likely, conditions of war outbreak. For any given level of Soviet
                                forces, balanced defense forces would allow the U.S. to take greater
                                risks to achieve a favorable outcome from such crisis periods.
                                Although the Soviets could overcome our defense by somewhat smaller
                                expenditures than the cost of our defense, they may not so respond
                                for a period of time, due to constraints on specific economic
                                resources or competing demands for these resources. And last, a
                                balanced strategic defense program would provide a more favorable
                                environment for disarmament negotiations, permitting the U.S. to
                                accept a smaller number of known or undetected offensive weapons
                                maintained by any potential enemy.</item>

                    <p>Our present strategic defense force provides only a nominal capability to
                        reduce the damage of a nuclear attack and is not consistent with any
                        rational strategic posture. The ultimate choice between these fundamental
                        alternatives should be implemented either by a phased reduction of our
                        present programs to meet limited defense objectives or by programs to
                        provide the basic elements of an effective defense. The import of this
                        decision should be recognized: This decision should be addressed at the
                        level of the aggregate strategic defense program as the effectiveness of
                        each major element depends critically on the scale of the other elements. A
                        decision to improve our continental air defense force is not consistent with
                        a decision against deploying a ballistic missile defense system. A decision
                        to deploy Nike X is not consistent with a decision against a fallout shelter
                        system. A decision on any one of the major elements implies a choice of
                        strategic postures which should not be made by default.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d145fn1">“The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that their
                            interdependence is not so absolute that difficulties in one of these
                            programs should restrict advancement in another.” [Footnote in the
                            source text. The quotation is from a November 6 <gloss target="#t_JCS1"

                            1800/774-2, JMF 7000 (1 Oct 63)) It stated that “measured against a
                            postulated Soviet threat which has not decreased in proportion to the
                            proposed reduction in US forces, the recommended program provides
                            insufficient defensive strength.” This deficiency was caused by
                            premature reliance on anticipated surveillance, warning and control
                            equipment, and postponement of missile defense and new interceptor
                            systems.]</note> At this time, I do not believe an intelligent choice
                        can be made between these fundamental alternatives. The recommended
                        strategic defense program, consequently, provides only those elements
                        required to meet limited defense objectives and to provide the technical and
                        organizational base for later decisions on the major elements.</p>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>The present warning systems, with several minor improvements, are adequate
                        for the next several years. The primary response to the changed warning
                        environment of the late 1960s will involve changes in our strategic forces
                        to reduce dependence on warning and changes in operational procedures to
                        make use of shorter warning times.</p>
                    <p>The present strategic defense force, unfortunately, provides only a nominal
                        capability to limit damage to U.S. population and industry and is not sited
                        for effective defense of the critical command centers and military forces.
                        At the present time, the damage resulting from a Soviet attack would be
                        limited primarily by the number and capability of Soviet offensive weapons,
                        the effectiveness of our counterforce response, and the effect of coercive
                        tactics on Soviet intentions and targeting. Our present strategic defense
                        forces are comparable to a building with fragile walls and no roof or
                        foundation. The air defense force is a costly product of earlier planning
                        for a large all-bomber threat, and is critically vulnerable to a small
                        ballistic missile attack; under favorable conditions this force could
                        probably destroy around 100 bombers, but most of the bombers would penetrate
                        to their priority targets.<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">The <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> believe this statement is based on
                            conditions more favorable to the enemy which now appear unrealistic.
                            [Footnote in the source text. According to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> memorandum cited in <ref target="#d27fn1">footnote

                            conditions for the enemy which appear unrealistic.”]</note></p>
                    <p>With no defense against ballistic missiles, a 50 missile attack would kill
                        more than 30 million people and a 200 missile attack would kill most of our
                        urban population. The <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> force provides a capability to destroy
                        around 30 percent of a follow-on attack by Soviet diesel-powered missile
                        submarines but provides only a limited capability against the growing
                        nuclear-powered submarine force. With full utilization of the present
                        fallout shelter spaces, a Soviet attack on military targets only would kill
                        more than 30 million people; no increase in active defenses alone would
                        significantly increase the survivors from a determined Soviet attack in the
                        absence of a complete fallout shelter system. Without a balanced strategic
                        defense, a determined Soviet attack in the late 1960s would probably kill
                        around two-thirds of the U. S. population. The present force, at most, could
                        provide some defense of our hardened military <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531"
                            facs="0563"/>forces, and a substantial re-siting would be required to
                        achieve this capability. Our present strategic defense program, in summary,
                        is larger than necessary to meet limited, feasible defense objectives and is
                        grossly inadequate to provide an effective defense of population and
                        industry.</p>

                    <p>A reduction of the present program should be accompanied by a reduction of
                        the missions for which they are charged. A low alternate strategic defense
                        program would provide a negligible capability to increase the population

                        surface-to-air missile force would provide an effective defense of selected
                        hardened national and military command centers and missile fields, where
                        none now exists. The forward bomber warning lines could be deleted,<note

                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> as the contiguous radars now
                        provide more warning to our strategic forces than is available against a
                        ballistic missile attack.</p>
                    <p>A continuation of the ballistic missile defense R&amp;D programs may not be
                        appropriate unless eventual deployment of Nike X or a similar system for
                        defense of urban areas is expected. (A ballistic missile defense of hardened
                        command centers and missile fields does not now appear competitive with
                        other means of reducing the vulnerability of these systems.) The missile
                        warning and space surveillance systems and the Nike Zeus test program are
                        requisite to maintain the effectiveness of our strategic offensive
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>A Congressional decision against the proposed shelter development legislation
                        would limit any additional fallout shelter spaces to those that could be
                        identified by an expanded shelter survey program. At most, this program
                        would provide 140 million shelter spaces (with a protection factor of 20 or
                        more) by 1970. This lower program, including the associated shelter stocking
                        and management programs, would increase the proportion of population
                        surviving a determined Soviet attack from around one-third to over 40
                        percent.</p>

                    <p>Against the range of feasible defense objectives, this low alternate program
                        would be nearly as effective and significantly less costly than the approved
                        program.</p>

                            Program</hi></p>
                    <p>The high alternate program outlined in this memorandum would provide the
                        basic elements of a balanced strategic defense on a schedule which makes
                        full use of the available technology and minimizes the annual fluctuations
                        of funding requirements. A nationwide fallout shelter system with the
                        necessary provisions for warning, shelter habitation, and post-attack
                        recovery, would be the most effective component of a balanced program; for a
                        total cost to the economy of around $7 billion, this program would increase
                        the proportion of the population surviving a determined Soviet attack in
                        1970 from around one-third to around one-half. The improved air defense
                        program and a ballistic missile defense of the 22 largest urban areas, for a
                        total cost (including five years operations) of around $25 billion, would
                        further increase the population surviving to around two-thirds. The air
                        defense program would also provide a considerably improved defense of the
                        hardened command centers and missile fields. The active defense systems
                        provide an additional capability to moderate damage to our industrial
                        structure, for which there appears to be no substitute short of a major
                        program to disperse and/or harden industrial facilities.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the scale of a potential attack, the desired level of defense,
                        and the amount of resources required, some additions to these programs
                        should be considered later. These include the deployment of a new
                        surface-to-air missile defense against bombers and cruise missiles in the
                        areas defended by a ballistic missile defense, deployment of Nike X at
                        smaller urban areas, and additional thermal countermeasures. An additional
                        $20 billion for a combination of these programs would increase the
                        proportion surviving to around three-fourths against a constant Soviet
                        threat or would provide a comparable level of defense against a somewhat
                        larger attack.</p>

                        substantial improvement, where a minimal capability now exists—an effective
                        air defense of selected hardened command centers and missile fields; the
                        program also includes a modernization of the ANG interceptor force and the
                        control system developments necessary for the replacement of <gloss
                            target="#t_SAGE1">SAGE</gloss> with a more survivable, flexible system.
                        The recommended program, however, should not be judged primarily by present
                        capability, but by potential future capability. This program differs from
                        the low alternate program, primarily, by providing the technical <pb n="533"
                            xml:id="pg_533" facs="0565"/>and organizational base necessary for
                        possible deployment of a balanced defense force at some later time.</p>
                    <p>The sections following discuss the major alternative programs for each major
                        component of a balanced defense, the analysis relevant to a choice among
                        these alternatives, and outline the recommended programs. Part I outlines
                        the air defense program. Part II outlines the ballistic missile defense
                        program. The related <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> and civil defense
                        programs are presented in separate memoranda.<note n="6" xml:id="d145fn6"

                    <p>In a memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> dated
                        November 15, 1963, Rostow enclosed two drafts of a basic national security
                        policy. One, dated November 8, was a 14-page paper described by <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> as “the essence.” The other was a
                        much longer paper dated November 11. Rostow stated that while the papers had
                        benefited from interagency discussion of previous drafts, they had not been
                        seen by anyone outside the Policy Planning Council. He stated that he
                        continued to believe “that promulgation of a <gloss target="#t_BNSP1"
                            >BNSP</gloss> would contribute in important ways to effective,
                        coordinated execution of U.S. policy.” No record has been found of action by
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on this memorandum or its
                        attachments during the remainder of 1963. The memorandum is in Department of

                    <p>(1) Strategic Retaliatory Forces. While not abandoning the concept of “damage
                        limiting” capabilities, Secretary McNamara in this very interesting

                        doctrine away from the concept of “damage limiting” counterforces to the
                        concept of “assured destruction” of the Soviet Union. Within this context
                        the central issue is the proper size for the Minuteman force. The analysis
                        presented makes it clear that we have a capability for “assured destruction”
                        of the Soviet Union entirely independent of the <gloss target="#t_MM1"

                        unimpressive argument in an attempt to demonstrate that under certain
                        extremely pessimistic assumptions one could justify the entire force of 1200
                            <gloss target="#t_MM1">MM</gloss> force under the requirement for an
                        “assured destruction” of the Soviet Union. The rationale for the <gloss
                            target="#t_MM1">MM</gloss> force level is tied exclusively to the
                        “damage limiting” concept. However, examination of the table on page 19 of

                        proposals essentially involve a reduction in <gloss target="#t_MM1"
                            >MM</gloss> force levels by 100 <gloss target="#t_MM1">MM</gloss> from
                        1300 to 1200, a slippage of one year in achieving these goals (<gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69),
                        and an acceleration in the retrofit program of improved <gloss

                        existing silos. I do not believe that the <gloss target="#t_OSD1"
                            >OSD</gloss> paper makes a real case either for the total force level or
                        for the urgency in the improved <gloss target="#t_MM1">MM</gloss> program,
                        even in the most pessimistic contingencies. (If one chooses to be
                        pessimistic about future adverse technological developments, I think that it
                        would be wiser to begin to invest strategic funds in advance systems
                        development such as the Polaris B-3 missile rather than build up of the
                            <gloss target="#t_MM1">MM</gloss> force beyond 950 since it is
                        conceivable that in the 70's the <gloss target="#t_MM1">MM</gloss> may prove
                        more vulnerable than we are now willing to admit.) While I think the
                        improved <gloss target="#t_MM1">MM</gloss> is a sensible program which
                        overcomes some of the serious limitations of the <gloss target="#t_MM1"
                            >MM</gloss> system, it is being pushed on a very tight concurrency
                        schedule for which there appears to be no military justification.<note n="8"

                        below 1200 and that an acceleration of the improved <gloss target="#t_MM1"
                            >MM</gloss> program is necessary to sell even this modest

                    <p>I believe that there is an additional issue here as to whether it is really
                        necessary to fire 10 percent of the missile force annually as part of the
                        reliability program. I do not believe that this many firings are necessary
                        to obtain adequate reliability statistics. Such a large number of firings
                        would also appear to be rather provocative as the size of the <gloss
                            target="#t_MM1">MM</gloss> force grows (e.g. one every four or five days

                        to cancel the program without any flights. I believe a practical solution to
                        this problem would be the cancellation of the third aircraft which the

                        the future. It is an unusual document that appears to have been written by
                        supporters of a very large continental defense program who were directed to
                        support a very small program. Since <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> is
                        not prepared to face the policy issues involved, it only appears practical
                        at this time to question whether the recommended program is in fact
                        consistent with future decisions to go either to a smaller or much larger
                        continental defense effort. The points raised by the <gloss target="#t_BOB1"

                        unless these can be shown to be technically unsound, they are probably
                        justified given our existing investment in <gloss target="#t_BMEWS1"

                        The basic issue on civil defense is whether we should attempt to get

                        light on this question. The paper does not make a convincing case for the
                        use of large numbers of <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss> submarines and
                        admittedly presents no rationale for the proposed force level other than it
                        will provide a better basis from which to build a force if it is found to be
                        necessary. While the <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> proposal to
                        entirely eliminate production of <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss>
                        submarines is very appealing, I am afraid that it is a bit too harsh to be

                        production capacity should be retained. Therefore, I would propose building

                            papers<note n="1" xml:id="d148fn1">The Strategic Country Studies were by

                        reaching the point of signature, and he wondered whether the White House was
                        prepared to accept them or whether the work would have been in vain. He said
                        that if the papers were not used, a lot of <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538"
                            facs="0570"/>talented and well-meaning bureaucrats would be
                        dissatisfied; they would have spent long months working on them for nothing.
                        On the other hand, if they were to be used, the procedures for getting them
                        approved as outlined by <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> should
                        be carefully scrutinized.</p>
                    <p>This led to a long discussion—one of several in the last few months—on the
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> papers, and there is no
                        other subject that makes <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>'s
                        staff bristle as much as this one. The exchanges, as they seldom do, become
                        sharp and direct. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> himself,
                        concerned essentially with operational matters, seems not to believe the
                        papers will be of much value in determining policies because they may be out
                        of date before they are finished. His basic approach, as he admitted today,
                        has been that since he could not stop the Rostow papers from being
                        developed, he could, if necessary, ignore them. Other people at the table,
                        who are more planners than operators—Ken Hansen,<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2"
                            >Assistant Director of the Bureau of the Budget.</note> for
                        example—think the papers may have some value. But the issues are seldom
                        joined directly. Instead they flit by in shorthand remarks.</p>
                    <p>The discussion was fairly long and, as noted, at times caustic. It dealt
                        essentially with three questions, although in no particular logical
                        sequence: (1) Are the Rostow papers worth the trouble? (2) How will they be
                        approved? and (3) What will their relation be to the Long Range Assistance
                        Strategies and the Internal Defense Plans?<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">These
                            were series of country policy papers prepared under the auspices of the

                            (Counter-Insurgency), respectively.</note></p>
                    <p>With respect to their value, the consensus was that, quite naturally, some
                        will be good and some bad. If the split is 50-50, that will be about what is
                        expected. The good ones should be used, the poor ones junked. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> thought that some attrition would be
                        beneficial in order to set a standard. With respect to level of approval,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> seemed to think, and
                        everyone agreed, that this would depend upon the subject of the paper and
                        its interest in the White House. Some papers could be approved by the
                        departments and need go no further. Others should come to the White House,
                        this determination being made by the White House staff officer responsible
                        for the country under study. Bundy looked on the White House role as being
                        the right to intervene without any obligation to do so. He agreed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Bromley Smith</persName>'s point that no
                        procedure should be established which allowed only disagreements to come
                        forward. The President is often as interested in what the department heads
                        have agreed on as he is on what they disagreed. In other words, if the White
                        House is interested, it will be interested across-the-board. Bundy closed
                        this phase of the discussion by saying that he would closely review the <pb

                        into the strategic policy studies. Given the view that the Secretary of
                        State should take stronger control over foreign affairs, the White House
                        staff feels that it cannot very well object to a Secretary of State decision

                        impact of these papers, was that the <persName corresp="#p_RWW1"
                            >Rostow</persName> documents could not be programming documents. He said
                        you could not make programming decisions in a policy document and, when

                        some countries where the policy could be set by the Secretary of State, and
                        other, less important, countries where the policy could be effectively set
                        by a level even below the Secretary of State. The Principals just would not
                        have time to acquaint themselves intimately with the details of each
                        country.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the discussion reached no recognized conclusions, and the role of
                        the strategic policy papers remains unsettled, although it seems they may be

                            corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>'s way of operating. Later, in the
                            <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> discussion, he repeated a remark he
                        has made several times lately, that a decision will have to be made as to
                        whether the White House will continue to monitor certain programs closely or
                        whether they will be left to the State Department. Klein, who is more
                        sensitive to these things than I, also connected Bundy's remark on
                        publishing President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s letter
                        to the State Department,<note n="7" xml:id="d148fn7">Not further

                            >Bundy</persName>'s retention perhaps is not yet completely settled. In
                        an earlier report, I believe I commented that <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                            >Bundy</persName> could well end up with more power if he stays. It is
                        not inconsistent to add that if he sees himself with much less power, he
                        will decide to go.</p>

                        <item>The greatest single requirement on the world's statesmen today is that
                            we should find a way to ensure the survival of civilization in this
                            nuclear age. This group knows better than most what a general nuclear
                            war would be like, and my view is simple: such a war would be the death
                            of all our hopes, and it is our task to see that it does not
                            happen.</item>

                        <item>On <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> and the need for fully effective
                            defenses I yield to no one. I have been concerned with the strength and
                            effectiveness of our Armed Forces for 30 years, and I mean to continue
                            with energy the great work which Bob McNamara and the Defense Department
                            have carried forward in the last three years. He and I have reemphasized
                            the need for economy in recent days and we mean it—but we do not mean
                            the kind of economy cuts into the necessary strength of the Armed
                            Forces. The basic improvement in the balance of power which has taken
                            place in the last three years is one-half of the explanation for the
                            sense of hope that was developing in President <persName

                        <item>But we must be <hi rend="italic">temperate</hi>, too. One of my first
                            concerns after the terrible event of November 22 was to make it clear to
                            the Soviet Government and to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> personally that the U.S. will go its part of
                            the way in every effort to make peace more secure. I do not agree with

                            we always remember that the other man sees things in his own way. We
                            need to show patience and understanding of other systems as well as our
                            own, and each of us should ask himself when he deals with other nations
                            how he would feel if he were in the other man's place.</item>

                    <p>The President opened the meeting with a summary of his views. He followed
                        more or less the draft prepared at his request by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> (copy attached).<note n="1"

                    <p>At the conclusion, the President asked Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McCone</persName> to present his briefing. The reading copy of Mr.

                    <p>The President asked several times at appropriate points in the briefing for
                        comparable U.S. figures. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> responded each time, giving comparative figures on
                        missiles, bombers, etc.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the briefing, the President asked Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to comment. The Secretary emphasized
                        that despite the problems which the Soviet Union is having in the economic
                        field, and despite our nuclear superiority, the Russians are making a
                        tremendous effort. We cannot reduce our effort in any way—military, space,
                        economic assistance, etc. We have a full agenda ahead of us. We should
                        concentrate on those factors which make people pull the nuclear trigger. We
                        should be ready to explore agreements with the Soviets which are based on
                        our current military strength.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> commented on the
                        relative military strength of the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. As regards a first-strike capability, we have a <pb
                            n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0576"/>2-1/2 to 3 advantage over the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In the air defense field, the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has a 3 advantage over us.
                        [sic]During the decade of the ‘60s, our advantage over the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the nuclear area will not fall below
                        two times. In a nuclear exchange, there would be no winner, even though
                        after such an exchange the U.S. would retain a superior capability than that
                        remaining to the Russians. A nuclear exchange involves the loss on each side
                        of from 50 to 100 million lives. Thus, any rational use of nuclear weapons
                        is deterred. However, the nuclear situation does not deter other uses of
                        military force, such as halting convoys on the Berlin autobahn. Neither side
                        now has a deployed anti-ballistic missile system. It would cost $15 billion
                        to give 30% of our population protection. As of now, neither side can blunt
                        an attack by the other.</p>

                        Director Webb made a comparison between Soviet and U.S. space capabilities.
                        During the next few years, we will be firing much larger payloads into orbit
                        although there will not be manned space projects during this period. The
                        Soviets will be conducting manned space projects during this period, but we
                        have no evidence that they are building delivery vehicles of the size we
                        will soon be firing.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> responded to the
                        President's request for a review of the domestic economic situation by
                        giving an optimistic report. He said economists had feared that our economy
                        would run out of steam in the next few months. However, better prospects for
                        the tax cut bill have stimulated business and especially the stock
                        market.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded the meeting by repeating a sentence which he had read
                        at the beginning, i.e.: “The greatest single requirement is that we find a
                        way to ensure the survival of civilization in the nuclear age. A nuclear war
                        would be the death of all our hopes and it is our task to see that it does
                        not happen.”<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">According to <gloss

                        previously planned, for several reasons. First, there has been some

                        projected for the late 1960's. <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-8-62,

                        increment of 50 missiles should reduce the risks of extensive modification
                        which can arise from difficulties discovered in the Improved Minuteman
                        development cycle and permits a more orderly deployment schedule. Moreover,

                        approved. Finally, the over-all force effectiveness of the recommended force

                        text not declassified] Improved Minuteman missiles. In terms of target
                        destruction capabilities, the recommended force provides [less than 1 line
                        of source text not declassified] percent greater effectiveness than the
                        previously approved force.</p>

                    <p>I also recommend that we continue development and procurement of the
                        Post-Attack Command and Control System, which includes 17 KC-135B airborne
                        command posts and 36 B-47 airborne communications relay aircraft. This
                        system permits the maintenance of one <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                        command post in the air at all times, plus one on a high state of alert at

                        These aircraft can launch and control the <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                            >SAC</gloss> force, including launching of the Improved Minuteman in the

                    <p>Based on advice from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Power, I have

                    <p>The objectives for our Strategic Nuclear Forces can be summarized under three
                        distinct headings. These objectives provide quantitative tests of the
                        adequacy of our posture.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">“Assured Destruction” of the Soviet
                            Union</hi></p>
                    <p>An essential test of the adequacy of our posture is our ability to destroy,
                        after a well planned and executed Soviet surprise attack on our Strategic
                        Nuclear Forces, the Soviet government and military controls, plus a large
                        percentage of their population and economy (e.g. 30% of their population,
                        50% of their industrial capacity, and 150 of their cities). The purpose of
                        such a capability is to give us a high degree of confidence that, under all
                        foreseeable conditions, we can deter a calculated deliberate Soviet nuclear
                        attack. The calculations made to test this ability are our best estimates of
                        the results of possible Soviet calculations of what we could do to them in
                        retaliation if they were to attack us. This calculation of the effectiveness
                        of the U.S. forces is not a reflection of our actual targeting doctrine in
                        the event deterrence fails. I will call this objective “Assured
                        Destruction.”</p>

                    <p>Beyond the force required to meet the test of “Assured Destruction,”
                        additional forces may be justified if they could further reduce the damage
                        to the U.S. in the event of a Soviet attack by an amount sufficient to
                        justify their added costs. Such forces might help to limit the damage to the
                        United States both by destroying some of the Soviet nuclear delivery
                        systems, and by disrupting the coordination of the rest, thereby easing the
                        task for our defensive forces.</p>

                        as follows: <list>

                            <item>The prospects for “Damage Limiting” by counterforce attacks may
                                not hold great promise in the latter part of the 1960's if the
                                Soviets harden and disperse their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"

                                as we now expect them to do. I believe that the recommended forces
                                accomplish what might reasonably be able to be done from this point
                                of view, and that the extra capability proposed by the Air Force
                                would make a contribution to “damage limiting” too small to be
                                justified in the light of its extra cost.</item>

                            <item>A “Full First-Strike Capability” does not appear to be feasible

                                expect. In any case, 200 or 750 extra Minuteman missiles, as
                                proposed by the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force,
                                respectively, would not significantly improve the outcome of the war

                        subject to uncertainties, development and deployment patterns have made

                    <p>The Soviets now appear to be deploying <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                        >ICBM</gloss>'s in both a soft configuration with two launchers per site and
                        a hard configuration with three launchers (silos) per site. One additional
                        missile is probably available to each soft launcher, but not to the hard
                        launchers, for a refire capability. Our own experience suggests their silo
                        hardness would be in the range 100 to 300 psi. Although <gloss

                        by the late 1960's the Soviets will be deploying only one instead of three
                        silos to a site, there is as yet no evidence of such a dispersal.</p>
                    <p>During the past year, the Soviets apparently have encountered difficulties in
                        the development of the SS-8 and have curtailed its deployment. The SS-8 was
                        suspected to be a large payload missile, 25,000 lbs., but further analysis
                        has indicated that its payload is similar to that of the SS-7 (2000-5000
                        lbs.). While no new missile development has been identified, the estimate
                        includes the possibility that, if test firings begin in the next few months,
                        a new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capable of delivering very high
                        yield warheads might be operational during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1966. No statement is made to imply that such test firings are likely to
                        begin. As a follow-on to the successful SS-7 program, the Soviets may either
                        improve this missile further, or develop a new standard size missile using
                        improved liquid propellants, with initial deployment in 1966-67.</p>
                    <p>By 1965, the Soviet IR/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> force will
                        probably level off at 700-750 launchers. Currently a refire capability for
                        soft launchers is available, and this force is deployed in a four launcher
                        per site configuration. The Soviets are also hardening some of their <gloss
                            target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss> sites, and while currently believed
                        deployed in a two launcher per site configuration, three launchers per site
                        is possible. There is no evidence to indicate that follow-on systems are
                        being developed. However, a mobile deployment of a new system is
                        possible.</p>

                    <p>The Soviets have under development a 700 n.mi. submerged-launch ballistic
                        missile for their submarine force. Existing submarine launched ballistic
                        missiles have only a 350 n.mi. range and the submarine must surface to fire.
                        At present, Soviet submarines carry at most three ballistic missiles.
                        Although likely, there is no evidence that the Soviets are building a new
                        class of submarine carrying more missiles. In addition to ballistic
                        missiles, the Soviets also have a large number of submarines (both nuclear
                        and diesel powered) capable of launching cruise missiles. It is believed
                        that the cruise missiles will be deployed in support of anti-shipping
                        warfare; however, the possibility that they could be used against land
                        targets is not ruled out.</p>
                    <p>By mid-1969, the number of submarines carrying ballistic missiles is
                        estimated to vary between 64 and 81, and in the absence of a new class <pb
                            n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0585"/>submarine, this force would carry
                        between approximately 185 and 236 missiles.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Long Range Bomber Forces</hi></p>
                    <p>Although the Air Force believes that the Soviets intend to deploy a new heavy
                        bomber between 1965 and 1967, this view is not shared by other members of
                        the intelligence community. Barring this possibility, there is a projected
                        reduction in both the heavy and medium bomber forces. Evidence indicates
                        that the Bear and Blinder “B” aircraft have available a standoff missile
                        capability. However, the capability for intercontinental attack remains
                        limited, even though the Soviets have given considerable emphasis to Arctic
                        staging exercises and to aerial refueling practice in an effort to overcome
                        range deficiencies of their bomber force. (The range of the medium bombers
                        is shorter than previously estimated.) The <gloss target="#t_NIE1"
                            >NIE</gloss> suggests that the Soviets could place only 90–115 heavy
                        bombers over target areas in the United States on two-way missions.</p>
                    <p>Availability of High Yield Weapons</p>
                    <p>We expect that in 1969 the yields of most Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"

                        high-yield weapons (100 <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> for delivery by
                        both bombers and missiles) to use as “terror weapons,” or to employ against

                    <p>Returning now to the broad strategic objectives mentioned earlier, I would
                        like to address first the forces required for “Assured Destruction.” The
                        effectiveness of our posture as a deterrent to deliberate Soviet attack
                        depends on the Soviet calculation of what we can do to them in retaliation
                        if they attack us. Although the Soviets would doubtless consider the
                        prospective military outcome of such an attack, they would have to give
                        great weight in their consideration to the number of people we could kill
                        and the amount of damage we could cause to their industry. Therefore, in
                        considering “Assured Destruction,” I shall calculate he destructive capacity
                        of our force on the hypothetical assumption that [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] even though in fact we
                        would not use our forces in that manner if deterrence failed. The key
                        decision we now face is the total size of our Minuteman force. Through the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 Budget, a force of [<hi

                        Minuteman missiles has been authorized. In the calculations that follow, I
                        shall assume that all other forces are held constant at the levels shown
                        from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 in the table on page 2, and then
                        vary the number of Minuteman missiles as we consider alternative
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>In 1969, without any Minuteman missiles, we plan to have about 1,900 weapons

                        Assuming that the Soviet Union, using the “Medium” force, attacks our forces
                        with a well planned and executed surprise attack, and that in all cases our
                        expected (i.e., most likely) estimates of operational factors (listed in

                    <p>But these calculations depend on the assumptions made about many uncertain
                        variables. In fact, there are several key uncertainties and possible
                        alternative assumptions considerably less favorable to ourselves than those
                        underlying these estimates. Because of the critical importance of our
                        ability to retaliate against deliberate surprise nuclear attack, I believe
                        that our force requirements for this mission should be tested against
                        pessimistic assumptions as well as against our best estimates. We want both
                        fully adequate insurance against future contingencies and to be able to
                        deter even an “optimistic” Soviet decision-maker.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that it is not normally sensible to design the defense program
                        entirely on the basis of pessimistic estimates. In fact, it can be just as
                        dangerous to overstate as to understate enemy capabilities, for it can lead
                        to the pricing out of the market of valuable capabilities that would appear
                        very useful under realistic estimates of the threat, and it can lead to the
                        adoption of strategies of desperation. In some cases, the fact that a
                        capability exists under optimistic estimates may be significant. However,
                        deterrence of deliberate nuclear attack is so fundamental to our whole
                        defense posture that I believe we should require that our retaliatory power

                        of uncertainties is discussed in Appendix II, pages 31-33.</p>
                    <p>The effect of making all pessimistic assumptions, however unlikely such a
                        contingency might be, as opposed to making the assumptions we consider most
                        likely, is shown for several alternative Minuteman forces in the following

                    <p>Granted there are uncertainties, in my judgment these calculations show that

                        force would add very little from this point of view. From a Soviet
                        viewpoint, the potential damage that could be inflicted by a United States
                        retaliatory attack is so severe that they, the Soviets, should be deterred

                    <p>Little is known about the Soviet targeting doctrine. The Soviets would
                        probably plan on attacking both military targets and cities. But it is
                        possible that we might be able to deter them from attacking cities or that
                        the war could be terminated before massive city attacks are executed. In the
                        table on the following page, cases are considered in which the Soviet attack
                        against our cities are either executed immediately, delayed, or withheld.
                        With respect to the extent of U.S. active and passive defense, if we have
                        fallout protection and effective defenses, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line of source text not declassified</hi>] can make the job of our
                        defenses easier and reduce directly the number of weapons falling on the
                        United States. Alternative U.S. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] are compared under alternative sets
                        of assumptions representing combinations of the above conditions. A case is

                    <p>These calculations suggest that the damage-limiting potential of [<hi

                        subject to diminishing returns. In the absence of a nation-wide fallout
                        protection program the U.S. fatalities are great even if urban-industrial
                        areas are not directly involved. For all cases considered, the advantage (as

                        keeping U.S. fatalities at a relatively low level. But in this case, greater
                        numbers of Minutemen beyond the level recommended do not substantially
                        reduce U.S. fatalities. Moreover, the potential damage to Western Europe
                        remains very high. For the two other Soviet postures U.S. and <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> fatalities are high, and additional
                        Minutemen do not hold great promise in reducing these fatalities. For the
                        Medium Soviet Posture, even if we were to augment Force IV with the Nike-X
                        anti-missile system at a cost of $20 billion (assuming the system could be
                        deployed around 23 cities by mid 1969) U.S. fatalities would, nevertheless
                        number about 35 million provided the U.S. has a nationwide civil defense
                        program. However, in the absence of a civil defense program and assuming the
                        High Soviet Posture U.S. fatalities would number about 120 million.</p>
                    <p>It would seem almost unbelievable that the Soviets would not react if we
                        started building Force IV augmented by Nike-X. What would be the prospects
                        in such an arms race? Studies suggest that, assuming Soviet costs are
                        similar to ours and that they disperse their hard <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>'s two to a point, and assuming that we wish to assure the
                        survival of 80 percent of our population (i.e., no more than 40 million
                        dead) after a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        against us. That is, if we attempt to maintain a [<hi rend="italic">less

                        attempt to achieve a capability to kill at least 40 million Americans in
                        retaliation) we must outspend them, at the margin, by three to one. And if
                        we set our sights higher than 80 percent, the cost exchange rate becomes
                        even more unfavorable.</p>

                            program would certainly be in civil defense and possibly in anti-missile
                            defenses, not more <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s; and second,
                            that the attempt to achieve a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                                of view, and that the extra capability proposed by the Air Force
                                would make a contribution to “damage limiting” too small to be
                                justified in the light of its extra cost.</item>

                        <p>In the memorandum the capability of U.S. forces to inflict high levels of
                            damage on the Soviet Union was calculated on the basis of expected <pb

                            problems of long range defense planning, we always encounter substantial
                            uncertainties about the factors that influence force requirements. Many
                            of these uncertainties can be described by the range of likely
                            possibilities. For purposes of planning and analysis, it is often useful
                            to describe this range by three estimates: an “optimistic” estimate, an
                            “expected” or most likely estimate, and a “pessimistic” estimate. The
                            pessimistic estimate is the estimate least favorable to ourselves of
                            those which are consistent with the available evidence. For example, we
                            have so far achieved about a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>]success rate in Minuteman <gloss
                                target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> tests. Based on this and our
                            experience with other missile programs, and assuming that we continue
                            reliability testing and development, it is my judgment that a
                            reliability of less than [less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified] under operational conditions by 1969 is effectively ruled
                            out by the data. And that is our pessimistic estimate. In fact, by 1969
                            we expect to achieve 75 percent, and possibly as high as 85 per cent
                            reliability under operational conditions.</p>
                        <p>The point here is that the relevant test is, “Is it consistent with the
                            available evidence?” and not “Is it conceivable?” A 1969 reliability of
                            [less than 1 line of source text not declassified] or less, is
                            conceivable. But it is so unlikely that it can be ruled out of the range
                            of practical possibility. This point requires emphasis because there is
                            a mistaken tendency sometimes to test our forces against the most
                            adverse circumstances conceivable.</p>

                        <p>First, the Soviets may improve the protection of their cities and
                            population beyond what we now expect. Our first calculation of expected
                            damage was based on the assumption that the Soviet populace use whatever
                            fallout protection is now available, but do not have a nation-wide
                            fallout protection program. Moreover, although we expect the Soviets to
                            deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses only at Leningrad
                            and Moscow, they might deploy such a defense at as many as 10 or 15
                            cities. Such a defense would cost us from $12-15 billion. Assuming a
                            nation-wide fallout protection program and <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                                >ABM</gloss> defenses for 15 cities, but not assuming Soviet
                            offensive forces larger or more effective than anticipated, [<hi

                        <p>Second, the Soviets may prove to have larger and more effective strategic
                            forces than those we now anticipate. The calculation of <pb n="562"
                                xml:id="pg_562" facs="0594"/>expected damage shown above was based
                            on the assumption that the Soviets would have the “Medium” force of 560
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s by 1969. The high <gloss
                                target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> estimate of the 1969 Soviet force is
                            now 700.<note n="16" xml:id="d151fn16">The Air Force dissent speaks of
                                750-1000 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s under certain
                                conditions. Although this possibility cannot be altogether ruled out
                                by the available evidence, if the Soviets were to embark on such a
                                building program, we would find out about it in time to expand our
                                own forces enough to offset it. We therefore do not need to buy
                                insurance against that possibility now. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> Moreover, there is uncertainty about Soviet missile
                            accuracy and reliability. The foregoing calculations were based on the
                            assumption of [less than 1 line of source text not declassified] missile
                            reliability (forces peaked for attack) and a [<hi rend="italic">less

                            estimates. However, I believe it prudent to insure against a reliability
                            as high as [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                                possible that the Soviets might have multiple guided re-entry

                                by 1969, although there is no evidence that the Soviets have begun
                                development on such a capability. Our own studies indicate that this
                                would be costly and difficult, and not an efficient way to expend
                                    [<hi rend="italic">expand?</hi>] our force. Therefore, I believe
                                we can rule out this possibility for 1969. [Footnote in the source

                        <p>Finally, there may be unanticipated wartime degradation in the
                            performance of our forces. There are several possibilities. First, we
                            have assumed that our warning systems work and that we successfully
                            launch the B-52 Alert Force. However, our force will be concentrated on
                            about [less than 1 line of source text not declassified]; the Soviets
                            will have missile launching submarines that can attack our bomber bases
                            with very little warning; there are ways in which they can reduce the
                            warning we get from their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s (e.g.,
                            long-way around or low angle trajectories); and we may be slow in
                            responding. We should consider the possibility of [<hi rend="italic"
                                >1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Another possibility is that, for one of several reasons, we might be
                            unable to launch our ICBM's before a Soviet follow-up bomber attack. One
                            reason for this might be disruption of our high-level command or
                            communications. Another might be that fear of the effects of gamma
                            radiation on the guidance systems, if we expose the missiles soon after
                            an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attack, would cause us to want
                            to hold the missiles in their silos until the radiation pulse has
                            passed. Therefore, we should consider our retaliatory capability on the
                            assumption that the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s must ride
                            out the Soviet bomber attack. Yet another uncertainty we face is the
                            precise blast resistance of our <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            silos. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines of source text not

                        <p>The results shown in the memorandum combined all four groups of

                        <p>Besides the ones already mentioned, there are other reasons for having
                            strategic forces available for targeting against Soviet military forces.
                            One is to give us the possibility of executing limited strategic
                            attacks. Admittedly our understanding of this range of possibilities is
                            very limited and inadequate at this point in time. But it will doubtless
                            become more important relative to other forms of thermonuclear war as
                            both sides deploy secure well-protected nuclear delivery systems. What I
                            have in mind here are controlled deliberate demonstrations of intent to
                            escalate to strategic nuclear war, to back up ultimata, and to do so in
                            such a way that the war might be able to be controlled and brought to a
                            close.</p>
                        <p>Assume, for example, that a conflict over Berlin, or elsewhere in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area, has expanded into a
                            large scale non-nuclear war and that we are losing. Although I do not
                            believe that our loss at the non-nuclear or small-scale tactical nuclear
                            level is as inevitable as commonly supposed, it is clearly a possibility
                            that must be considered. In these circumstances, it may be desirable to
                            have, as an alternative, the possibility of a [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2

                            clearly provides us enough missiles for such contingencies.</p>

                            protect, their forces from U.S. missile attack has at least two
                            advantages for us. The first is that it forces the Soviets to incur a
                            very heavy cost whence, out of any given budget, they can afford fewer
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>We do not have detailed studies of the cost of protecting our forces, but
                            there are many indications that it is high. For example, we maintain
                                [<hi rend="italic">7 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>

                        <p>These factors suggest that the program of protection of our Retaliatory
                            Forces from nuclear attack has roughly doubled their cost. If the same
                            factors apply for the Soviets, and we have no reason to suppose the
                            contrary, forcing them to harden would halve the number of weapons they
                            can deploy.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, we have found it very difficult to harden our large liquid
                            fueled missiles to the point that we can have high confidence they will
                            survive ground shocks and still operate. This is one of the factors that
                            led us to Minuteman. A Soviet liquid-fueled missile capable of
                            delivering a 100 <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss> warhead would have a
                            gross weight of approximately 660,000 pounds. This represents a weight
                            twice that of Titan II, and two and one-half that of Atlas F. While this
                            Soviet missile could be hardened, assurance of making the silos
                            withstand high overpressures could be difficult. By forcing them to
                            harden, we may force them to go to smaller missiles with lower
                            payloads.</p>
                        <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0596"/>
                        <p>Finally, forcing the Soviets to harden may be desirable from the point of
                            view of creating a more stable posture, reducing their incentive as well
                            as their ability to make a pre-emptive strike against us. However, in
                            view of the fact that the recommended U.S. force provides us with
                            between a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                                text not declassified</hi>], I do not believe that a further
                            increment in our forces is required for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>Our possession of a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] puts significant constraints on the Soviet
                            attack planner. In the cost of their bomber operations, the Soviets can
                            get substantially more out of their intercontinental bomber force if
                            they can stage it through peripheral staging bases. But this is a very
                            vulnerable operation. If they have to take seriously the possibility
                            that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]they must plan a far less vulnerable operation
                            which would deliver fewer bombers to the United States. [<hi
                                rend="italic">5 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] However,
                            it is clear that the recommended U.S. forces will provide enough
                            missiles for this purpose.</p>

                    <p>I have recently completed my review of the Army and Marine Corps General
                        Purpose Forces for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965-<gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969. The recommended program will form the
                        basis for the preparation of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965
                        Budget. This memorandum summarizes the main factors I have taken into
                        consideration in determining United States requirements for these
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>I believe we should adopt, for planning purposes, the Army and Marine Corps
                        force structure summarized in the table on page two. Where they differ from
                        my recommendations, the forces proposed by the Army are shown beneath mine
                        in parentheses. In particular, I recommend we: <list>

                    <p>In addition, I recommend disapproval of Army proposals to expand the Air
                        Mobility tests; to add additional maneuver battalions to existing divisions;
                        to add additional combat and support units to STRAF; and to add two Hawk
                        battalions. The Deputy Secretary also recommends inclusion of $45.6 million

                    <p>The Marine Division-Wing teams I am recommending are those recommended by the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff and proposed by the Secretary of the Navy. The Army
                        divisions and brigades I am recommending are concurred in by the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff, except for the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army, who with the
                        Secretary of the Army recommends the larger forces shown in parentheses in
                        the table on page two. In the case of the Air Assault Division, the
                        deployment decision can be deferred until next year. Since the test program
                        I have approved is still in its early stages, a decision to program this
                        division at this time would be premature.</p>

                    <p>The key issue in designing a non-nuclear posture is the size and strength of
                        the enemy. For many years Soviet and ChiCom forces have been greatly
                        overestimated in western military thinking. This has led to an
                        overestimation of the forces required to stop them and, consequently, to an
                        air of hopelessness about our prospects of winning in a major non-nuclear
                        war. As the discussion below shows, however, our prospects for successful
                        non-nuclear defense along the Sino-Soviet periphery are better than is
                        commonly supposed. The problems we face are related more to readiness,
                        deployment capability and tactical mal-deployment than they are to matters
                        of manpower and equipment resources.</p>

                            Intelligence Estimates, 11-63)</note> estimates that the Soviets get
                        about 145 divisions and cadre divisions out of their theatre ground force of
                        1,950,000 men, and that about 80 of these units, having 80 per cent of their
                        manpower, can be called combat ready.<note n="6" xml:id="d153fn6">U.S.
                            Divisions are not considered fully combat-ready unless 90 per cent
                            manned. Our divisions in Germany are programmed for 98 per cent manning
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> This number of divisions can be maintained within the
                        estimated total manpower only if the active Soviet division “slice” is very
                        small. If all 145 divisions were manned equally, the slice would be 13,500;
                        if only the 80 operational divisions were manned, their slice would be
                        25,000. Obviously, reduced strength and cadre divisions use some men, so the
                        actual slice must be less than 25,000. In addition, the Soviet Army surely
                        has manpower requirements not directly related to its divisions, and must
                        fill them at the expense of the slice.</p>
                    <p>Further, despite the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>'s estimate of 145
                        divisions and 1.95 million men in the Soviet theatre ground forces, there
                        have been indications that the Soviets may be maintaining smaller numbers.
                        Recently, a joint <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/<gloss
                            target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> group concluded that the number of
                        divisions and cadre divisions may be smaller than had been estimated. The
                        group's view is that the total is between 115-135 such units, and that the
                        number of combat-ready divisions is in the range of 58-75, in contrast to
                        the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>'s 80. So far as manpower goes, the
                        group's view is that a high degree of confidence <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569"
                            facs="0601"/>can be placed on a range of 1.8 to 2.1 million men in the
                        total Soviet ground force.<note n="7" xml:id="d153fn7">This study has not
                            yet been addressed by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and is

                                >USIB</gloss>. The full range of uncertainty is estimated by the
                            group to be 1.5 to 2.4 million men in the total Soviet ground forces.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Computations on this basis
                        indicate that the slice would be 15,000 if available manpower were spread
                        evenly over 125 divisions. On the more likely premise that support forces
                        are furnished in proportion to the division's combat-readiness category, the
                        slice for combat-ready units is about 23,000.<note n="8" xml:id="d153fn8"

                                >DIA</gloss> panel's highest confidence estimate is that Soviet
                            divisions and division cadres are divided into readiness categories,
                            thus:</note> Since the value of 1.95 million men represents total ground
                        force strength in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/<gloss
                            target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> group's view, as opposed to the <gloss

                        force strength only, further subtractions would have to be made for

                        200,000 for air defense forces. This latter subtraction is only one of
                        several which should be made, but it is typical, and the largest of <gloss

                        on the Soviet Army. (1. 1,950,000x.765B65=23,000. 2.

                    <p>In contrast, if one were to divide the U.S. Army's total manpower by its
                        combat-ready divisions, the resulting slice would be about 60,000 men. Many
                        of these men, however, are also in activities not directly related to
                        support of the divisions (e.g., 25,000 in ARADCOM, 10,800 in South Vietnam,
                        30,000 in Intelligence and Security, 48,000 in Command and General Support,
                        etc.). Allowing for this, the U.S. Army division slice, worldwide, is on the
                        order of 34,600. Although division slices are not a precise measure of
                        effectiveness, the differential between this figure and the Soviet slice of
                        less than 23,000, indicates that a Soviet division's support is slender or
                        that it is to be generated on mobilization.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Communist Army is organized into 34 Field Armies of 132
                        divisions, of which 117 are at operational strength. Unlike their Soviet
                        counterparts, these are primarily infantry forces. Their support consists of
                        separate armored, artillery, anti-aircraft, and armored cavalry units, plus
                        engineer, service and support units. The non-divisional combat support
                        provided is roughly equal, in numbers of men, to Soviet levels <pb n="570"
                            xml:id="pg_570" facs="0602"/>but administrative and logistic support
                        forces comprise only about 25 per cent of the total forces. The latter is
                        low even by Soviet standards, while both combat and logistic support are
                        deficient by U.S. standards.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Communist Army is still essentially a World War II model and even
                        by these standards is lacking in firepower and mobility. In many cases it
                        has not reached its own authorized levels of equipment. The main strength of
                        the Chinese Communist Army is in manpower, an advantage which does not stand
                        up well against a well-equipped, modern Army. Its main weakness is
                        logistical, compounded by its having been designed and built to operate with
                        large scale Soviet logistical and technical support. Without Soviet
                        assistance, China may be able to supply itself with small arms and
                        ammunition, but it could not produce the needed quantities of armor,
                        artillery, vehicles and other heavy equipment.</p>

                    <p>The development of military force structures, especially in an alliance, is
                        not an exact science. Quite apart from the variables introduced on one's own
                        side, there is the difficult matter of arriving at a precise estimate of the
                        enemy's potential. A substantial margin of uncertainty seems inescapable,
                        and while it is obviously unsafe to underestimate the enemy, an
                        overstatement of his capability is equally dangerous. It can lead to a
                        strategy of desperation and to pricing necessary and valuable military
                        capabilities out of the market. Thus, although it would be simpler to design
                        our military posture to deal with a single objective and a single estimate
                        of enemy capabilities, we must confront the full range of uncertainty,
                        maintaining both a hedge against unfavorable possibilities and the ability
                        to take advantage of favorable circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The uncertainties stem, in large part, from the intangibles inherent in
                        ground combat. Many things other than sheer numbers and the amount and
                        quality of equipment influence the combat effectiveness of ground forces.
                        Tactical surprise, morale, training, the ability to keep large forces
                        healthy in the field, generalship, terrain, the air situation, defense
                        versus offense, and sheer chance can and will affect the outcome of any war,
                        campaign, or individual battle. But, before any differences between the two
                        sides in these factors can be taken into account, it is necessary to
                        establish some basis for comparing the measurable aspects of opposing ground
                        forces on the assumption that the non-measurable factors are equal. One
                        obvious measure is strength in men. Another can be derived from the relative
                        firepower which has been measured by an Index of Comparative Firepower
                            (<gloss target="#t_ICF1">ICF</gloss>). This technique was originally
                        developed by the Army as a means of resolving arguments arising during
                        maneuvers. It has been increasingly applied in studies and in wargaming of
                        specific tactical battle situations, although it was not designed for
                        application on a strategic scale over an entire campaign. The Secretary <pb
                            n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0603"/>of the Army has stressed this
                        limitation, with respect to both the <gloss target="#t_ICF1">ICF</gloss> and
                        a parallel index which takes into account some items beyond raw firepower,
                        the Index of Combat Effectiveness (<gloss target="#t_ICE1"
                            >ICE</gloss>).<note n="9" xml:id="d153fn9">The Chairman, <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, also has reservations: “the ‘Index of
                            Combat Effectiveness' has no practical validity and would fall under
                            sharp criticism if presented for serious consideration in international
                            discussions. While we in the military service have sometimes used
                            coefficients of effectiveness in maneuvers to determine and control
                            combat outcomes, no one seriously believes that the outcome of battle is
                            calculable in mathematical terms through their use. If a mathematical
                            solution to combat outcomes were possible, it would have to resolve an
                            equation of many variables (such as weather, terrain, proximity of the
                            enemy, time of day, status of supply and equipment, physical condition
                            of troops, their courage, morale, leadership), which are all constantly
                            changing. The most important factors, courage, morale and leadership,
                            are not subject to physical measurement. If as most soldiers believe,
                            ‘in war the morale is to the physical as three is to one,' only about a
                            fourth of the determinants of victory are susceptible to the coefficient
                            approach and they are variables undergoing constant change . . . . There
                            is insufficient recognition of some of the critical aspects of the
                            defense of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> such as the shallowness
                            of the combat theatre and the decisive advantage accruing to an
                            aggressor in concentrating his forces swiftly for the attack of a
                            critical sector.. [Footnote in the source text. The quotation is from

                    <p>I accept these reservations, but feel that, so long as it is clearly
                        understood that these indices do not take into account the intangibles
                        mentioned above and are not an infallible means for predicting the outcome
                        of an entire campaign, they are useful in determining relative
                        pre-hostilities combat potential—certainly the best tools now available.
                        Some such tool is clearly needed. In addition to their obvious task of
                        fighting effectively if war comes our military forces must, in peacetime,
                        deter aggression and provide a power base for the conduct of our foreign
                        policy. Our civilian leaders need a means of assessing, in broad terms for
                        each specific situation, the probable adequacy of our deterrent and the
                        strength of the military foundation supporting our diplomatic position.
                        Moreover, some approximate aggregate factor is needed to correct the
                        widespread tendency to equate U.S. and Soviet divisions, despite the fact
                        that ours contain, with their Corps support, at least twice as much
                        manpower, as well as more expensive equipment. I am, therefore, asking the
                        Army to continue its investigations with the aim of reaching the most
                        accurate <gloss target="#t_ICE1">ICE</gloss> possible.</p>
                    <p>If U.S. Mechanized and Armored divisions are compared to their Soviet
                        counterparts, the Motorized Rifle and Tank divisions, on a basis of raw
                        firepower, we find a differential of about 10 per cent in our favor:</p>

                        The U.S. Mechanized division advantage was 1.075/1; the Armored division
                        advantage was 1.48/1.]</p>
                    <p>This calculation does not, however, take account of the firepower contributed
                        by the division's proportionate share of those non-divisional combat units
                        normally pooled at the next higher tactical level: the U.S. Corps and Soviet
                        Combined Arms Army. When non-divisional combat support is included, the U.S.
                        advantage increases:</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a table entitled “Indices of Comparative Firepower: Division

                        Armored division advantage was 1.69/1.]</p>
                    <p>However, our mechanized and armored division fighting-forces are about twice
                        as large as their Soviet counterparts in terms of manpower, and it appears
                        that we equip each of our men with about 30 per cent more initial equipment
                        than do the Soviets, measured in U.S. prices. There is substantial
                        uncertainty about comparative expenditures, but a <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> study has estimated the costs of building various Soviet

                    <p>In combination, the manpower and money we invest in our divisions and their
                        immediate combat support should produce an advantage in comparative
                        effectiveness of at least two to one, but firepower ratios give only 1.2—1.7

                            higher percentage of professionals and the higher level of experience
                            and training in our Army. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> At issue
                        is the contribution of those men and that equipment which either do not
                        appear in firepower calculations or whose real contribution is out of
                        proportion to their direct firepower scores because their contribution is to

                    <p>In summary, the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army conclude that on
                        comparing a U.S. Corps and a Soviet Combined Arms Army we find ourselves
                        stronger, more mobile and able to outshoot the Soviets. The U.S. Corps gets
                        superior reconnaissance and flank protection from its armored cavalry units,
                        better control from its communications units, <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573"
                            facs="0605"/>and from its advantage in engineers, the ability to
                        facilitate its own movements while impeding the enemy's. With light aviation
                        units organic at lower levels, it benefits in mobility, control, and
                        battlefield surveillance, and its logistics come from a system proven
                        repeatedly in war. In short, the U.S. organization provides its commander a
                        rounded capability for combat, which I believe is at least 1.75 to 2.3 times
                        that of comparable Soviet divisions. The Secretary of the Army and the Chief
                        of Staff feel, however, that at this stage of our investigation of this
                        matter, we should equate one U.S. division to 1.2 to 1.7 Soviet

                            >NATO</gloss></p>
                    <p>At the outset of any discussion of United States strategy in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Europe, it should be clearly recognized
                        that the United States is not a free agent. United States strategy and
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy are inextricably linked
                        and our ability to influence the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        members is limited. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategies which
                        may be militarily and economically feasible may be politically infeasible or
                        feasible only after extensive psychological preparation.</p>
                    <p>If Europe is vulnerable to a non-nuclear attack today, as it is, it is not
                        the result of overwhelming Soviet strength, nor failure of the Europeans to
                        devote men and a great deal of money to defense. The immediate problem is
                        much more one of balance and inefficiency in the allocation of resources. In
                        my remarks to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council last
                            December,<note n="12" xml:id="d153fn12">See <ref target="#d120">Document
                                120</ref>.</note> I pointed out that for Europe to meet virtually
                        its [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] goals would take about 1 per cent more of the growing
                        aggregate European GNP and that this, along with our own contribution, would
                        provide Europe with a solid non-nuclear defense. In the light of our recent
                        studies of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact tactical
                        air and ground strength it appears that our position was entirely warranted
                        and, in fact, that it should be possible to get the most important gains
                        with increases of less than this amount. In any case, U.S. forces will not
                        by themselves provide an adequate non-nuclear force for the defense of
                        Europe. Our leadership can help, but the basic remedies lie with the other
                        members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Despite <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s relatively encouraging
                        position in manpower and units, its forces could not assuredly hold the
                        Soviets at a forward line. Mal-deployments, frictions, and misunderstandings
                        within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces could give the Soviets
                        an opportunity to break through in a decisive way. If one or more of the
                        larger countries in the center were to drop out of the conflict <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s position would be untenable. However,
                        the Soviets also have problems—apart from their lively concern that <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might employ nuclear weapons—in that the
                        reliability of their allies is questionable, especially if the situation is
                        such that the Soviets are not clearly in the ascendancy.</p>
                    <p>Given anything like the present Russian strength, and our tactical air
                        strength, well-equipped and stocked <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        forces [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        least to delay to and defend on the line of the Rhine against a Bloc
                        surprise non-nuclear attack without using nuclear weapons. There would
                        remain the possibility of a sudden Soviet nuclear attack catching us by
                        surprise, and there is also a possibility that the Alliance might not hold
                        together. But, for a wide range of circumstances <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces should do well, provided they had reached their
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] goals.</p>
                    <p>Within the past year there has been a net increase in non-U.S. <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense budgets of about $1.3 billion
                        (from $18.7 billion to $20.0 billion). About one-half of the increase has
                        come in Germany, and has provided an increment of real power. The “hard
                        core” high priority budget increase that I proposed last December as meeting
                        the most urgent needs of the non-U.S. members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, amounts to $3 billion a year. The prospects for getting
                        this much of an increase in European defense budgets are remote. However,
                        having in mind the existing balance of forces described above, it is
                        becoming increasingly obvious that the problem is not so much getting the
                        Europeans to spend a great deal more, but rather getting them to fill gaps
                        in their efforts and to get a better balance of effort.</p>
                    <p>Most of our non-nuclear requirements studies look at the problem of defending
                        Europe against a massive attack. I believe it at least equally important
                        that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> have strong conventional forces
                        for use in contingencies arising over Berlin, or in connection with other
                        contingencies whose course is hard to predict. In either, our ability to put
                        pressure on the Soviets—a crucial element in crises of this sort—may depend
                        on our ability to make limited military moves without using nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>Neither our opponents nor our Allies have their forces at the high readiness
                        of U.S. forces in-place in Europe. France has only two divisions in Germany.

                        in a crisis, the French Army is to be at 450,000 man strength in peacetime,
                        with plans for expansion in a <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0607"

                        from a peacetime force of 260,000 men to over 700,000 within 72 hours.
                        Britain also plans to fill out its three division requirements by airlifting
                        two brigades and a division headquarters from the U.K. in an emergency—a
                        move that would take at least seven days.</p>

                        with the alternative of resorting to tactical nuclear weapons or increasin.

                    <p>These German and Soviet forces clearly do not have “instant readiness” by
                        U.S. standards, but their practices have some merit. The Germans in
                        particular man their combat units at a relatively high level, counting on
                        reservists to perform less demanding rear activities. They claim to be able
                        to mobilize the necessary reservists in 72 hours, and one estimate is that
                        their mobilized units would reach 70 per cent effectiveness in 10-14 days.
                        For many rear area functions this German estimate may be correct; although
                        it should be noted that German planning has not yet been rigorously tested,
                        and not all the necessary reserve units are organized and equipped. Somewhat
                        similarly, the British plan on reinforcing the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1"
                            >BAOR</gloss> within a period of seven days from the alert, and the
                        French would have to move forces into Germany as well as calling up <pb
                            n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0608"/>reservists. CINCEUR may, therefore,
                        be optimistic in estimating that all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        first echelon reserve units with a peacetime manning level of 65 per cent
                        would be brought to full strength and deployed in 20 days, and that second
                        echelon units at 5 per cent strength could be brought to full strength and
                        deployed in 30-35 days. Certainly, at that stage, these reserve units would
                        be less effective than those active on M-Day.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets apparently also plan to fill out units rapidly. Although they
                        intermittently call up former active duty people for training, they do not
                        have a systematic program for maintaining their reserve personnel at a high
                        state of training. Therefore, at a minimum, it would probably take the
                        Soviets, as well as our Allies, several weeks to get non-operational ground
                        force units in a state approaching combat readiness and deploy them. For
                        this reason, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> estimate that although
                        the Soviets could fill out their total divisions (115-135 in <gloss
                            target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> panel's
                        view) rapidly, only about 20 Soviet divisions, beyond those now combat-ready
                        (58-75 in <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                            >CIA</gloss> panel's view) would become operational by M+30.</p>
                    <p>This disparity between the high readiness of our ground forces and those of
                        our opponents and Allies raises the question: “Are we allocating our
                        manpower resources efficiently?” Although the Communists might launch a
                        sudden attack in any of a number of areas, our principal limiting factor in
                        meeting such a contingency at this time is our deployment capability, not
                        the readiness of our entire Army structure, including its logistic system.
                        Further, in Europe 100 percent manned U.S. units have on their flank
                        non-ready, under-manned Allied units.</p>

                        done last year by the Chairman's Special Studies Group in the Joint Staff.
                        These studies, which are being brought up-to-date in the light of new
                        intelligence and other factors, cover a wide range of situations, showing
                        the requirements for ground forces in relation to those now available.
                        United States and Allied forces worldwide are summarized in the following
                        table. Communist forces are summarized on the following page. The table
                        after these summarizes U.S. divisional requirements for nine potential
                        conflicts on the Sino-Soviet periphery. (Fatalities in Millions)</p>

                    <p>In the Middle East Iran is the area most vulnerable to Soviet attack. It is
                        also especially difficult for us to move forces to this country rapidly and
                        to support them there. The Russians maintain 24 divisions, of which <pb
                            n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0609"/>12 are operational, and about 1,000
                        combat aircraft in the military districts bordering Iran.</p>
                    <p>Taking account of the severe communications and logistics limitations in the
                        rugged terrain of northern Iran, the net initial Soviet threat is estimated
                        to be about 10 divisions. The bulk of the Soviet aircraft are short-range
                        day fighters unable to reach very far south into Iran.</p>
                    <p>This attack would present us with a formidable problem. With our programmed
                        airlift capacity for 1968 we could build up our forces as depicted

                    <p>With its 10 divisions and strong air support the Soviet Union can dominate
                        the situation in northern Iran. Assuming that Iranian forces hold together
                        and withdraw south to the Zagros Mountains, and also assuming that the
                        Russians do not take key centers in the south, including Abadan, by air
                        assault, the U.S. might be able to deploy enough forces (8 divisions and
                        about 1,600 aircraft) to stop the Soviets at the Zagros Mountains, or even
                        mount a counterattack, although this would require an additional six
                        divisions.</p>
                    <p>This situation obviously is touch and go. Our response time in this case is
                        critically important. For this reason, the Middle East-Indian Ocean area is
                        the one in which pre-positioning of stocks has a great payoff. For example,
                        if we had 30,000 tons of stocks in a depot in the area (possibly a forward
                        floating depot) the time to get two divisions into Southern Iran in 1968
                        (one airborne, one infantry) would be cut from 40 days to 20 days. The 40
                        day figure takes into account that heavy equipment which must be moved by
                        sea. This is the equipment which would be pre-positioned. The difference of
                        20 days could be decisive in certain circumstances. We are investigating
                        this possibility and analyzing its costs.</p>
                    <p>Another point to be noted is that our ability to hold Southern Iran might
                        depend on moving a relatively small force, along with some air defenses
                        (interceptors or Hawks), very quickly to key ports and airbases in Southern
                        Iran, in order to prevent their seizure by Soviet air attack.</p>
                    <p>In short, treating this as a single-situation contingency, our main initial
                        limitation is deployment capability, not forces. Programmed additions to our
                        airlift capacity will help, and so would pre-positioned equipment in the
                        area. I will make recommendations to you when the results are in from our
                        investigation of pre-positioning.</p>

                            >SEATO</gloss> Allies could successfully defend the area against a
                        21-division Communist attack. The 13 Thai and South Vietnam divisions in the
                        area (used mostly for counter-guerrilla and rear area security tasks), plus
                        five U.S. divisions and one Commonwealth Division, rapidly introduced into
                        the area, along with allied air superiority, could halt the enemy along the
                        general line of the 15th parallel and thence north along the Mekong River.
                        To restore the situation would take four more U.S. divisions, or a total of
                        nine.</p>
                    <p>In that region we have a major logistic advantage. For example, with air

                    <p>A Chinese Communist or North Vietnamese division consumes about 75-150 tons
                        per day in conditions of average combat; a U.S. infantry division,
                        approximately 371 tons. The transportation net available to the Communists
                        can support about 7 to 12 of their divisions at their average combat rates.
                        Most of the 21 division Communist force therefore would be capable only

                    <p>This study examined a resumption of the war in Korea under several different
                        assumptions, the most pessimistic of which had the Chinese Communists
                        sending troops covertly into North Korea before a coordinated North Korean
                        and Chinese attack: 36 divisions on D-day and 63 divisions by D-plus 30
                        days. The Special Studies Group estimated that seven more U.S. divisions in
                        addition to the two in place, or a total of nine, along with the <gloss

                        and regroup on the Han River line. With eventual U.S. air superiority and
                        five additional U.S. divisions, these forces could restore the present
                        position.</p>

                        attack; (2) Medium in which the Chinese join after the outbreak but commit

                        elsewhere should they get over-committed; and (3) High in which the ChiComs
                        commit all their divisions in the Mukden area plus further divisions from
                        their strategic reserve (this is the case referred to above, the most severe

                            400,000. The Communist Spring Offensive of April-May 1951, for example,
                            involved 30 ChiCom and North Korean Divisions, with about 375,000 men at

                    <p>Though we have conducted several studies of tactical nuclear warfare on the
                        ground in Europe, we have not yet been able to clarify fully the role of
                        tactical nuclear weapons in our over-all strategy. For example, we have yet
                        to resolve important questions about the vulnerability of ground forces to
                        nuclear weapons and the feasibility of sustained operations in a nuclear
                        environment. In general, our understanding of this kind of warfare is far
                        less advanced than our apparent understanding of most other kinds of
                        warfare. So far our studies suggest the following conclusions:</p>
                    <p>There are reasons for believing that the escalation potential of tactical
                        nuclear warfare, of the type on which present plans are based, is high,
                        particularly in terms of increasing yields. We are looking for ways to
                        reduce this escalation potential.</p>

                        of nuclear conflict, the design of our ground force nuclear systems should
                        be oriented primarily, but not exclusively, toward the last three of these

                    <p>Tactical nuclear warfare presents large areas of uncertainty which have not
                        been resolved. We have had no experience in it and cannot be sure we have
                        the right mix and balance of weapons. The main uncertainties are these:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">How Might the War Start?</hi></p>
                    <p>Troops in barracks areas are extremely vulnerable to nuclear attack without
                        warning. On the other hand, with even a little warning, troops can rapidly
                        disperse to field locations, in which case far more nuclear strikes would be
                        needed to inflict the same casualties. If nuclear weapons are employed from
                        the outset, installed atomic demolitions can be fired as the enemy
                        approaches; if they are not, uncertainties about timing complicate their
                        installation and employment. Similar problems plague other planned nuclear
                        fires and troop deployments. These problems of timing stem primarily from
                        delays inherent in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s decision making
                        machinery, which, of course, is subject to a multitude of political
                        imponderables.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Escalation?</hi></p>
                    <p>Estimates of civilian casualties in Europe range from several hundred
                        thousand, for a restricted zone battlefield campaign, to from five to fifty
                        million or more for a theater-wide tactical nuclear war. Whether constraints
                        against escalation can prevail over the temptation to employ larger weapons
                        to destroy the enemy's nuclear delivery means before they are used is a
                        large question. For example, the vulnerability of our nuclear strike
                        aircraft in Europe creates a major instability. This would be a source of
                        major concern to commanders attempting to conduct a limited battlefield
                        nuclear war.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Soviet Weapons and Concepts?</hi></p>
                    <p>As far as we know, Soviet planning, like <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> planning, has emphasized theater-wide nuclear attack. The
                        Soviet nuclear stockpile is estimated to be much smaller than ours and,
                        perhaps largely for this reason, Soviet programs have not emphasized short
                        range small nuclear warheads as we have. They, of necessity, would be forced
                        to use longer range, higher yield systems. Soviet classified military
                        writings reflect their relative scarcity of warheads, the absence of a
                        concept to limit nuclear engagement to forward areas or to a sector of the
                        battlefield, and an interest in some quarters in employing a small number of
                        high yield weapons to destroy the opposing army. These negative Soviet
                        attitudes <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0614"/>toward the possibility of
                        a forward zone, small yield nuclear conflict may change as their stockpile

                        difficult to predict how these various groups would behave when subjected to
                        such a novel and unpleasant experience as an intensive tactical nuclear
                        engagement. Our studies suggest that in the first several days casualties in
                        engaged combat forces might be as much as 50 per cent. A large number of
                        units would receive 30 per cent or more casualties. Many survivors would
                        have gotten radiation dosages, whose level would be quite difficult to
                        determine. The cumulative effect would be intense, on troops, on
                        intermingled civilians and on decision-makers alike, as they sought to
                        correlate fragmentary reports and take appropriate actions, both military
                        and civil. There would be major problems at all levels in sustaining a

                        Weapons</hi></p>
                    <p>On the basis of the work done so far we have much to learn concerning
                        tactical nuclear warfare, both from the point of view of its military
                        consequences, including the central question, “To whose advantage would it
                        be?” and from the point of view of the political environment in which it
                        would occur. It is clear, however, that we do not have an adequate basis at
                        this time for placing greater dependence on a tactical nuclear strategy of
                        the type described by the British and Germans. We are providing an option
                        for this strategy in the planned buildup of tactical nuclear weapons, and in
                        the event of a sudden Soviet attack in Europe, we may be forced to rely upon
                        it. Against this contingency a serious effort is being made by the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to develop plans for limited zone, low
                        yield operations involving the engaged battle zone and its immediate
                        interdiction.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows a full-page table.]</p>

                            and Deployments</hi></p>
                    <p>Although it is a major objective of our General Purpose Forces programs to
                        open up as many useful military options as possible, we must decide on the
                        relative emphasis to be put on preparations for non-nuclear versus nuclear
                        conflict. In the nuclear category, resources must be further allocated among
                        programs for short range battlefield systems, longer range interdiction
                        systems, and still longer range theatre systems whose functions are
                        virtually the same as our strategic retaliatory forces. <pb n="585"
                            xml:id="pg_585" facs="0617"/>Within both the nuclear and non-nuclear
                        categories we must decide on how much mobility to have, and on the scale and
                        duration of possible conflicts. We must also make decisions concerning the
                        number of conflicts we should be prepared to handle simultaneously and the
                        performance to expect from Allies, and must make assumptions on the
                        circumstances in which war may break out.</p>
                    <p>Several things are clear in this regard. First, our ability to predict
                        contingencies is poor. Second, while we can and should take out some
                        insurance against low probability contingencies—especially if they are
                        dangerous ones—in the design of our General Purpose Forces we must give
                        great weight to the more probable ones. Third, being able to handle the
                        biggest or the most dangerous contingencies does not necessarily mean that
                        we can manage others equally well. We have learned this in
                        counterinsurgency, and we are learning the greatly differing demands of
                        nuclear and non-nuclear conflict. Fourth, there may or may not be any wars
                        in the 1965-1969 period above the counterinsurgency scale, but there will
                        surely be situations in which our ability to use measured force will be
                        relevant—if not critical—as in Cuba, Berlin, and Thailand.</p>
                    <p>It would be a mistake to concentrate on any one or a few of these peacetime
                        or wartime objectives and neglect the others. We must give careful
                        consideration to the full range of enemy capabilities. Surprise attack is
                        one of these, against which we must always be alert and prepared. We were
                        surprised at Pearl Harbor and in Korea, and so long as there is an enemy
                        capable of launching a surprise attack we may be surprised again. Logically,
                        surprise attack is less likely where U.S. forces are deployed and,
                        historically, the best deterrent and defense against surprise attack has
                        been forward deployments. The presence of U.S. forces insures that any
                        attack will immediately involve U.S. power, decreasing the enemy's chance of
                        achieving a decision before U.S. and Allied reinforcements can intervene.
                        Where there are no U.S. forces the temptation is greater and the likelihood
                        of surprise attack is increased. In such areas emphasis must be on early
                        detection of the long build-up required for a major attack—with due
                        consideration to the lag between perception and action—and our general
                        purpose forces must be able to move quickly into the area, applying
                        increasing pressure both to reassure our Allies and to force the enemy to
                        back-off. In Europe, in particular, for both military and political reasons,
                        we should continue to have large forces on the ground.</p>
                    <p>In the event of surprise attack against areas in which we have ground forces,
                        Europe and Korea, we may find it necessary to use nuclear weapons. Present
                        U.S. and Allied capabilities, however, are strong enough to keep this issue
                        from being forced on us early. In any event, this decision should not be
                        regarded as automatic. And, if nuclear weapons are used, we should try to
                        limit their use to the battlefield, initially <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586"
                            facs="0618"/>to force the opponent to back down or failing that to hold
                        him. Depending upon the method of allocating “dual capable” costs, our
                        battlefield nuclear programs take less than 10 percent of the ground forces
                        budget. This is not too high a price for this insurance.</p>
                    <p>As to the scale and duration of non-nuclear contingencies for which we should
                        be prepared, at present our largest scale contingency plan involves no more
                        than 10 divisions (five deployed from <gloss target="#t_CONUS1"

                        guarantee against larger conflicts, but simply that we have been unable to
                        foresee them.</p>
                    <p>It is easy to be very wrong on contingencies. But, it is clear that the U.S.
                        should not, for example, plan on trying to solve the problem of non-nuclear
                        defense of Europe by itself. Despite our assessment that Soviet conventional
                        strength is lower than has been thought, and improvement in German forces,
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will not be able to fight a large
                        non-nuclear war on a sustained basis during at least the next several years.
                        The conditions for a sustained non-nuclear defense of Europe are now in
                        sight, however, and our planning and negotiations should begin to exploit
                        this forthcoming alternative to nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>This assessment of contingencies and their implications for the design of our

                        November 29, emphasizing the need for economy and for closer supervision of

                        was all to the good despite the fact that the German defense expenditures,
                        as per cent of GNP, still did not match those of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> briefly described
                        the manner in which the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘65 defense
                        budget, beginning with the initial recommendations of the <pb n="588"

                        the Department of Defense. The Secretary particularly noted the
                        participation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in its development: their
                        comments on each of the draft memoranda to the President prepared by the
                        Secretary on the various program packages, their many and extensive
                        discussions with the Secretary on the over-all budget as well as portions of
                        the budget, and finally, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> corporate

                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that was prepared in response
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s request, in a
                            November 30 memorandum to the Chiefs, for a statement of concurrence in
                            his recommended program. The full sentence begins: “Although the force
                            structure does not include all the forces recommended by members of the

                            capacities, the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree . . .” The December 16
                            memorandum includes an appendix listing those <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> recommendations that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"

                        that though elements of each Service's recommended forces were still not
                        provided for in the budget, he and all the Chiefs felt that—on balance—this
                        budget would provide effective forces for our national security. The
                        Secretary then suggested that the meeting proceed by having each Chief give
                        his reactions to the proposed budget and his comments thereon.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> then expressed the
                        appreciation of all the Joint Chiefs for this opportunity to discuss
                        directly with their Commander-in-Chief the proposed defense budget and any
                        resulting problems of concern to the individual Services. He compared the
                        present extensive role of the Joint Chiefs in the development of the
                        over-all force structure and defense budget vis-a-vis their much narrower
                        participation a few years previously when he had been Chief of Staff of the
                        Army. He noted that, at that time, each Chief was deeply involved in his
                        individual Service submission whereas the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> had little time or opportunity to consider thoroughly the
                        impact of the defense budget as a whole. In contrast, the Joint Chiefs now
                        spend a great deal of time on the overall defense budget and the force
                        structure it supports; their consideration goes beyond the parochial views
                        of their Services. Furthermore, the Joint Chiefs were privileged to consider
                        and comment on any program change proposal, submitted to <gloss
                            target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>, which they considered to be of
                        significance. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> noted
                        that the JCS had participated in 104 meetings during which budgetary
                        matters, force structure, or PCPs related to this year's budget had been
                        discussed. He also pointed out that the Joint Chiefs avoid dealing with
                        uni-Service matters and that they had neither the intention nor the time to
                        become experts on line items in the Services' modernization or R&amp;D
                        programs. Such matters were dealt with through Service Secretary <pb n="589"
                            xml:id="pg_589" facs="0621"/>channels, while the Chiefs concentrated on
                        their main role as principal advisors to the President on strategy and
                        national security. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>
                        closed by indicating that the proposed budget was, over-all, a good one;
                        nevertheless, there were some items which were of concern to the individual
                        Services and he felt that each Chief should comment on these.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> summarized the Army
                        view by noting that the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘65 Army budget
                        was tight but that it would support the Army at the present level of
                        strength and activity through the fiscal year. He pointed out that the
                        Army's budget had varied from $11.96 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63 to $13.10 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        ‘64 to $11.994 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘65. The
                        President noted that this was about the same as for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘63 and that the figures had been reduced slightly from
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s original
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> indicated his concern
                        over the PEMA portion of the budget which had dropped from $2.5 billion in

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> then returned to his
                        last area of concern, the Nike-X, stating that he considered the lack of a
                        ballistic missile defense the most serious deficiency in our defense
                        posture. He considered the R&amp;D <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-65
                        funding to be ample and the funding for the Nike Zeus Kwajalein tests to be
                        satisfactory. He assured the President that the Nike-X development program
                        was proceeding on schedule, calling particular attention to the work being
                        done on the multi-function radar, the missile site radar, and the Sprint
                        missile. He emphasized the need for a decision, by fall of CY 1964, to
                        permit deployment of a Nike-X unit to the first operational site in
                        September, 1969. This decision should be affirmative in view of the Soviet
                        Union's actions to protect and harden its <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss> sites.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> then reiterated his
                        views as to the tightness of the budget and the level of support it would
                        afford the Army. He warned that reduction of these funds, should the
                        Congress take such action, would be at the expense of the Army's combat
                        readiness and its potential combat effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>The President then queried General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1"
                            >Wheeler</persName> as to whether he could stand on the budget and his
                        readiness to defend it before Congress and before the reserve officers, who
                        were likely to be critical.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> replied affirmatively.
                        He noted that, at a luncheon meeting, he had met with the Reserve Components
                        Advisors to the Secretary of the Army and had informed them of the tightness
                        of the budget <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0622"/>and its probable
                        impact on both the active Army and the reserve forces; in his view, they had
                        accepted the facts in a most satisfactory manner.</p>
                    <p>The President then expressed his appreciation of General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>'s stand, noting that no one would
                        get everything that he wanted. Nevertheless, the over-all <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘65 budget would provide more than others
                        previously had received and about as much as the country could afford. He
                        then cautioned that we would get less than we need unless all exercised care
                        in their defense of the budget. In his view, with a new President in office
                        in an election year, administration officials would find the Congress
                        probing extra deeply. He asked all present to stand together when they “got
                        on the line”.</p>

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> then assured the
                        President that the Air Force had received his austerity message loud and
                        clear and was prepared to live with it. He noted that he was not concerned
                        over the airlift and tactical air forces which the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> ‘65 budget would support. These forces were being modernized
                        with a new transport and an advanced tactical fighter both actively under
                        development. Though the rate of modernization was not all that he would like
                        it to be, on balance he was not unhappy about these particular forces. On
                        the other hand, he was deeply concerned in regard to strategic forces and
                        air defense forces.</p>
                    <p>At this point General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> handed to
                        the President a letter, dated 29 December,<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">Not
                            found.</note> on his evaluation of both the strategic and the air
                        defense situation as well as his proposal for an improved manned strategic
                        aircraft and an improved manned interceptor. He indicated that all of the
                        Air Force's pertinent studies, as well as other studies of the <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, had concluded that the strategic
                        superiority of the United States would rapidly diminish from the present to
                        1968. He then referred to estimates of the rapid rise of the total
                        megatonnage of Soviet weapons on the alert vis-a-vis those of the United
                        States, as well as to study conclusions that the Soviets' protected missiles
                        could inflict greater damage on the U.S. than we could inflict on the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This latter was due to the manner of
                        distribution of the population of the two countries and the Soviet
                        production of weapons of higher yields than those of the U.S. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> emphasized the decrease in
                        the budget for strategic forces from $9 billion in 1962 to a forecast
                        estimate of less than $3 billion in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        69.</p>
                    <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0623"/>
                    <p>In response to a Presidential query, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> noted that the Air Force's <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 65 budget totaled approximately $19.5 billion. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> pointed out that even
                        should a decision be made later to increase the $3 billion strategic forces
                        budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69, it would be difficult to do
                        so inasmuch as research and development activities in this field were
                        diminishing rapidly and the present strategic systems were phasing out. Thus
                        there would be but little which could be put into production.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the ballistic missile force levels, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>'s view was that the budget would
                        provide about 150 less missiles than the number necessary to attack all
                        essential targets on a time-urgent basis. Fortunately, the manned bomber
                        systems could make up for this deficiency.</p>
                    <p>At this point there was considerable discussion as to whether 50 Minuteman
                        missiles had been deleted from the budget submitted by the Secretary.<note

                        analysis of our strategic force requirements, which had accompanied his
                        budget submission, the Bureau of the Budget had concluded that the addition
                        of these 50 missiles would not effect any significant increase in the
                        strategic power of the United States and was, therefore, not justified in
                        view of the tight budget which the President had set as an objective. This
                        action would save $150 million of new obligational authority from the <gloss

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> observed that
                        there was no real disagreement concerning the need for these missiles in
                        that Mr. <persName>Gordon</persName> had merely recommended postponement of
                        procurement rather than cancellation. Further, he noted that proceeding with
                        his program for these 50 missiles would result in an <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 65 expenditure of about $70 million despite the <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 <gloss target="#t_NOA1">NOA</gloss> of
                        $150 million and the over-all cost of $250 million associated with these
                        missiles. He estimated that such postponement would increase the over-all
                        cost of the missiles by some $35 million because of the “break” both in
                        missile engine production-line programming and in the construction of
                        missile sites. The Secretary also called attention to the fact that, while
                        he felt it necessary for these 50 missiles to remain in the budget, General
                            <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>'s view was that these 50
                        missiles were the minimum essential number and that, additionally, 150 more
                        missiles would be desirable. General LeMay agreed with the Secretary and
                        stated that he favored a 1400 Minuteman force by the end of <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 as opposed to the Secretary's recommended
                        force level of 1200 Minuteman missiles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Gordon</persName> stated that he would accept the Secretary's
                        judgment regarding the additional costs that would be engendered by
                        postponement <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0624"/>of the funding for the
                        50 missiles in question; thus, he would agree with the program proposed by
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that it just did not make good sense to increase the
                        over-all cost of this program by $35 million in order to save $70 million in
                        expenditures in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65. He noted, too, that it
                        would be possible for General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>
                        to defend the budget as best he could if the number of missiles he
                        considered minimum essential were included even though he realized that
                        General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> considers it desirable
                        to have 150 additional missiles. Thereupon, it was generally agreed that
                        these 50 Minuteman missiles should be included in the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 65 budget.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> then went on to state
                        that his greatest worry was due to the absence of anything new coming along
                        in the way of a manned strategic system. Under present force programming and
                        aircraft utilization rates, it was apparent that the B-52s would have an
                        average of more than 6000 airframe hours before they were phased out.
                        Modifications were already being made to the B-52 fleet due to the
                        structural stress imposed by the increasing use of low-level tactics. In
                        contrast, he noted that previous aircraft in the strategic fleet had been
                        phased out with an average airframe time of 2000 to 3000 hours. This
                        problem, in conjunction with the diminishing capability of the B-52 aircraft
                        for effective mission performance in the increasingly sophisticated Soviet
                        air defense environment, had convinced General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1"
                            >LeMay</persName> that it was essential to develop a new manned bomber
                        to replace the B-52.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that this increasing trend toward relying solely on
                        missiles as our means for strategic delivery was a matter which had worried
                        him over the past several years. He then queried General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> as to his recommendations.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> called attention to the
                        fact that over the last year various study groups within the Air Force,
                        including Project Forecast, had been studying the requirement; from this
                        effort a new proposal for an improved manned strategic system had evolved.
                        He was not referring to the B-70, which he considered “dead”, but rather to
                        an aircraft to be designed primarily for low-level penetrations at subsonic
                        speeds with a capability for high performance at high altitude, i.e., speeds
                        in excess of Mach 2. The advanced state of the art which only now permitted
                        such a design was mainly due to the availability of the new variable
                        geometry wing. The basic armament would consist of short-range
                        air-to-surface missiles in addition to weapons now in the inventory;
                        integral to this system, there would also be a reconnaissance subsystem
                        consisting of the necessary radar, infra-red, and photographic sensors. He
                        estimated that it would require $5 million of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 64 funds and $50 million of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 65 funds to get the design studies, program definition, and
                        advanced development of long-lead items proceeding in an orderly fashion. To
                        the President's query as to whether this represented the money required for
                            <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0625"/>studies as to what should be
                        done to replace the B-52s, the Secretary noted that the proposal was not
                        merely a study, but the initiation of development of a new aircraft. He
                        estimated that the ultimate cost of this new weapons system would probably
                        be on the order of $10 billion. General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1"
                            >LeMay</persName> generally agreed in that he estimated the ultimate
                        cost would be close to $9 billion.</p>
                    <p>The President noted again that he was interested in this problem and wished
                        to explore it further. However, he pointed out that at this stage he did not
                        wish to become committed to a $9 billion project; he then asked what course
                        of action was open if a follow-on bomber were not provided.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary indicated that, following the phaseout of the present bomber
                        fleet, delivery of our strategic weapons could be handled by the employment
                        of land-based ballistic missiles and the sea-based Polaris missiles.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> then reaffirmed his
                        belief that it was necessary to maintain a proper “mix” in our strategic
                        forces. He presented his misgivings in regard to an all-missile force which
                        would not have the discrimination nor the reliability of the manned
                        strategic systems and which could not furnish to the decisionmakers the
                        flexibility of response or the multiple options so necessary in our
                        strategic forces. Further, the missiles did not have the reliability of the
                        manned systems because of the vulnerability of the total capability of the
                        missile system to a single, unforeseen system deficiency. On the other hand,
                        should the system not be working properly in a manned bomber, the crew could
                        fly to the target, identify it, and drop their weapons thereon.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary indicated the actions under way, in line with the Joint Chiefs
                        recommendations, for appropriate tests to increase the reliability of our
                        ballistic missiles. He expressed confidence that the $500 million program
                        which he had proposed for this purpose would meet with such success that, in
                        the timeframe General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> was
                        addressing, the reliability of our missiles would meet the objectives which
                        had been set. The Secretary detailed the reasons as to why he was not at all
                        sure that the Air Force proposal was the answer to the problem which was
                        causing the concern expressed by the President and by General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>. He noted that this proposal was not
                        for a traditional bomber but for an airborne platform from which missiles
                        could be launched. Such a low-level penetrator would be extraordinarily
                        complex and a very expensive system to develop. The air-to-surface missiles
                        it carried would represent an advanced state of the art and, in his opinion,
                        would almost certainly be “unreliable”—if the missiles in our present
                        inventory could be so termed. The testing program for such a system would
                        meet with the same problems with which we are confronted today, e.g., the
                        difficulty of finding a way to test-fire the complete system to include the
                        nuclear warhead. <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0626"/>He expressed
                        doubts as to the capability of this system to “gravity drop” weapons
                        inasmuch as it had not been specifically designed for this function. The
                        Secretary summarized by stating his opinion that the proposed system would
                        be unreliable; notwithstanding, should the system turn out to be a reliable
                        one, the Air Force did not as yet have a plan or a concept for its
                        employment in wartime. In the ensuing discussion, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> set forth the pros and cons on these
                        points.</p>
                    <p>To the President's query regarding his support of the cited $55 million
                        figure for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 and <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 65, the Secretary responded that he was absolutely against
                        it until such time as both he and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were given a
                        chance to study the proposal in detail. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName> noted that the Joint Chiefs had been unaware of the
                        proposal and were not prepared to support it until they had the opportunity
                        to consider it carefully.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that there was no need to make a decision right at the
                        moment, though it was of the utmost necessity that he have a firm budget by
                        the 8th of January so that he could complete preparations for its submission
                        to the Congress. There was nothing to preclude a later request to Congress
                        for funds which were deemed necessary. He suggested that General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> get busy and formally forward his
                        proposal to the Secretary who had indicated that he did not have the benefit
                        of advice from the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> pointed out that his proposal was
                        contained in the letter he had just delivered, both to the President and to
                        the Secretary. Further, he was not requesting an increase in the over-all
                        Air Force budget; he proposed to obtain the necessary funds by reprogramming
                        his Air Force budget, as necessary, from items of lower priority. The
                        Secretary remarked that he did not think it feasible, or necessary, to come
                        to a decision by the 8th of January. He indicated it would be wise to stand
                        on the present budget and to study the Air Force proposal later.</p>
                    <p>The President summed up by requesting General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1"
                            >LeMay</persName> to submit his proposal to the Secretary and to the
                        Joint Chiefs. Then, after it had been “worked over”, this matter should
                        again be brought up to him as he wished to explore it further inasmuch as he
                        knew many of his old colleagues on the Hill were worried over this trend
                        toward an all-missile force. He closed by stating that he wished everyone to
                        stand by him on this budget in their appearances before Congress.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> then turned to the
                        subject of air defense wherein he stated that the picture was dismal. True,
                        intelligence estimates indicated a slight degradation of the threat.
                        However, our available intelligence was not too good and the Russians had
                        been successful in hiding their new developments. He referred to several
                        aircraft that the Russians had built and, in some cases, had flown in air
                        shows before we had been <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0627"/>aware of
                        their existence. He saw no great reason to believe that we would do much
                        better in the future in this respect.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, according to General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1"
                        >LeMay</persName>, our air defense capabilities were going downward. He
                        delineated several reasons: our radar and control systems were
                        deteriorating, in that portions of the <gloss target="#t_SAGE1">SAGE</gloss>
                        system were being phased out prior to appropriate replacement by the new
                        BUIC system; our current interceptors were becoming obsolete, and even these
                        aircraft were gradually being phased out by attrition; further, we had
                        terminated production of our air defense interceptors.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> felt
                        it was urgent to get on with the development of an improved manned
                        interceptor. He observed that in his letter to the President he had proposed
                        the development of a long-range aircraft which could intercept and destroy
                        enemy bombers before they had reached the stand-off range from which they
                        could launch air-to-surface missiles at the continental United States. The
                        current interceptor force did not have that capability. He noted that
                        considerable funds had already been expended and that $40 million in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 funds would enable the Air Force to
                        proceed with the orderly development of long-lead items for the interceptor
                        and its fire control system. Thus, he was requesting the authority to
                        reprogram $90 million, from the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 Air
                        Force budget, for both the improved manned strategic aircraft and the manned
                        interceptor.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary, after alluding to a classified project, stated that the basic
                        issue was not whether such an aircraft should be developed but, rather,
                        whether such an interceptor should be produced and deployed. This issue was
                        related to General Wheeler's remarks regarding the <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                            >ABM</gloss>. He noted that if, next fall, the decision were made not to
                        deploy the Nike-X units, it would not be reasonable to proceed with
                        production and deployment of improved interceptors inasmuch as the country
                        could be destroyed by ballistic missile attacks. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> observed that there was a further
                        interrelation in this issue, i.e., the decision as to whether or not to
                        press forward on civil defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> summed up by stating that all three of these
                        matters would be up for decision in the latter part of 1964.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> voiced his opinion that
                        the decision on the improved interceptor should not be contingent on these
                        other decisions. He pointed out that it was also necessary to protect the
                        sovereignty of this country's air space and that, without such an improved
                        interceptor, this requirement could not be met once supersonic transports
                        became operational. He also observed that the Soviets had indicated that
                        they were working on such an aircraft and that the British, working in
                        concert with the French, had announced that their supersonic transport would
                        be flying in 1968.</p>
                    <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0628"/>
                    <p>At this point the President changed the subject of discussion to the
                        development of a supersonic transport aircraft by the United States. He
                        stated that, in his opinion, the Secretary of Defense was the proper person
                        in our government to supervise this gigantic and expensive project. Further,
                        he indicated that he was thinking of a Board to consist of Mr.
                            <persName>Halaby</persName>, Mr. <persName>Black</persName>,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d154fn5">Najeeb Halaby, Administrator of the FAA, and Eugene

                        “run with the ball” until it encountered real trouble. The Secretary
                        laughingly noted that this would not take very long.</p>
