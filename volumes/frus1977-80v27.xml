                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of
                    the Historian, under the direction of the General Editor of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans, researches, compiles,
                    and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first
                    promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for the selection
                    and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. These regulations,
                    with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State historians by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. The records that constitute the Department’s
                    central files, which were stored in electronic and microfilm formats, will be
                    transferred eventually to the National Archives. Once these files are
                    declassified and processed, they will be accessible. All of the Department’s
                    decentralized office files from this period that the National Archives deems
                    worthy of permanent preservation will also eventually be transferred to the
                    National Archives where they will be available for use after declassification
                    and processing.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is also undertaken
                    through special access to restricted Presidential Library and other U.S.
                    Government agency records. While all the material printed in this volume has
                    been declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents.
                    Archivists and declassification reviewers are processing and declassifying many
                    of the documents used in this volume, but they may not be publicly available in
                    their entirety at the time of publication.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted. </p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Team Lead of the Editing and Publishing
                    Team. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia
                    or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed
                    and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical
                    documents within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been
                    supplied by the editors for each document included in this volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original text,
                    except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes
                    and omissions in documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction
                    is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Bracketed insertions are used
                    to indicate omitted text that deals with an unrelated subject (in roman type) or
                    that remains classified after declassification review (in italic type).</p>
                <p>Words and phrases underlined in the original document are printed in italics.
                    Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the original text. In
                    telegrams, the telegram number (including special designations such as Secto) is
                    printed at the start of the text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>The amount and, where possible, the nature of the material not declassified has
                    been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of text that were omitted.
                    Entire documents withheld after declassification review have been accounted for
                    and are listed with headings, source notes, and number of pages not declassified
                    in their chronological place.</p>
                <p>All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes. All
                    ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in the Jimmy Carter subseries was done in Carter
                    Presidential Library record collections scanned for the Remote Archives Capture
                    (RAC) project. This project, which was administered by the National Archives and
                    Records Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to
                    coordinate the declassification review of classified records held in various
                    Presidential libraries. Throughout the course of the project many, but not all,
                    such records at each Presidential library were scanned. As a result of the way
                    in which records were scanned for the RAC, the editors of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always able to determine whether
                    attachments to a given document were in fact attached to the paper copy of the
                    document in the Presidential library file. In such cases, some editors of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated this
                    ambiguity by stating that the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,
                    and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. The Advisory Committee does
                    not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the series, but it
                    makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and reviews volumes
                    as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory obligations.</p>

                                Trudeau ready to enter into a closer, more supportive relationship
                                with the U.S. To seize the opportunity I recommend that the
                                President show generosity on individual bilateral issues, address
                                the Quebec question, and spend some time on such major bilateral
                                issues as environment and gas. End summary.</item>

                                possibly beyond. You will find him in a fighting mood, determined to

                            <item>For Trudeau the meeting with the President has unusual importance.
                                With its new political and economic vulnerabilities, Canada needs
                                U.S. support. Trudeau is not prepared to acknowledge this publicly
                                or even privately, but he appears ready to act on it. Already this
                                last year Trudeau has progressively muted the nationalist and
                                anti-American elements of his policy. With completion of the

                                interest in and admiration for the United States in Canada, and with
                                the Quebec crisis, I believe he is now ready to launch with us a new

                            <item>In line with this, Trudeau hopes to develop a close personal
                                relationship with the President, permitting frequent meetings and
                                contacts. He is not fully satisfied with his relations with three
                                past Presidents (so he tells me), and found himself less at ease
                                with them than with European leaders. Indeed so conscious has
                                Trudeau been of American power that he has tended to be unnaturally
                                deferential and subdued in presence of U.S. Presidents, more than
                                ordinarily defiant at a distance. I think he is determined to
                                overcome both excesses this time.</item>

                                the American Government and business will react to separatism, and
                                whether one or the other may attempt to exploit the split in Canada.

                                He should say that there is no way a disaggregated Canada would be
                                in the U.S. interest, and note the importance of Canada’s success to
                                us as an industrial democracy, in East/West, North/South and
                                cross-border relations. He might ask whether there is anything that
                                we can do to help. Trudeau will probably decline the offer, and may
                                be reluctant to discuss the issue, but this approach and
                                particularly the tone with which it is done can allay some of his
                                underlying concerns about how we will act in the current crisis.
                                Publicly, subject to the judgment of Trudeau, it would be helpful
                                for the President to express the importance to the U.S. of having as
                                a neighbor a strong, successful, prosperous Canada occupying its
                                place in the world. Such a statement, without interfering in
                                Canadian affairs or slamming Quebec, would serve notice to the
                                separatists that they can expect no comfort from us. It would also
                                help contain the fears (or hopes) of many Canadians who openly
                                speculate that the United States would pick up the pieces if Canada
                                broke apart—speculation that can itself be destabilizing.</item>

                                        countries taken as a whole. Convinced that inflation is the
                                        chief enemy, the Canadian Government has delayed stimulative
                                        action despite record unemployment and discouraging growth
                                        forecasts. Government is now edging towards stimulus, easing
                                        money, getting ready to end wage and price controls, talking
                                        about job programs. We should encourage them to move faster.

                                with Ambassador Warren December 31. However I think it important for
                                two reasons. First, as Trudeau has told me a couple of times, no
                                meeting will be credible to Canadian media and public unless it
                                addresses bilateral issues. Absent such discussion, media here will
                                play visit as another U.S. putdown with main U.S./Canada issues too
                                trivial for U.S. President to address. Second, it will be more
                                difficult to work our way through the mass of bilateral issues
                                coming up this year if the Canadian administration has doubts about
                                intent at Presidential level. I recognize the additional demand on
                                the President’s time, but believe that preparation on each of these
                                issues can be summary. Some, as noted above, could be handled at

                        <p>The meeting began with the President and Prime Minister exchanging
                            pleasantries about the size of their respective cabinets and how often
                            they meet.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he was grateful that the Prime
                            Minister had come to Washington. The meetings would be helpful to him.
                            He had been in office only a month, and had a lot to learn. He looked
                            forward to having a personal friendship with the Prime Minister, and
                            hopefully as an adviser as well. He hoped that they could keep in touch
                            when difficult decisions had to be taken, especially since it was
                            impossible to separate the two countries.</p>
                        <p>The President said he hoped the talks could be informal, and would defer
                            to the Prime Minister on the order. Perhaps they could first talk of
                            things of general importance, not directly on relations between the
                            United States and Canada. The President said that after eight years—and
                            judging from his two years’ campaigning—that the American people need
                            reassurance. Other nations had been waiting for a change in the
                            administration, and had kept many issues in abeyance.</p>
                        <p>The administration is now pulling together a cohesive approach to foreign
                            policy. Information on the various trips taken by members of the
                            administration would be available to the Prime Minister. The Vice
                            President had been to Europe and Japan; Clark Clifford to the area of
                            Cyprus. Secretary Vance would be back tonight, and would be going to
                            Moscow. The President himself was now seeing foreign representatives,
                            such as the Ambassadors from the Soviet Union and China, and there would
                            be more top level meetings, as with Middle East countries, Britain, and
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Now the American people want their government to be committed to human
                            rights, decency, truth, not intruding in the affairs of other countries,
                            but offering our services where we can help, as in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Some basic decisions were coming on quasi-non-political subjects like
                            energy. The Prime Minister would know more about this issue. Before
                            April 20, the administration will have a comprehensive energy program,
                            with saving energy as its cornerstone.<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">On

                            the question of dealing with the energy problem on a long-range
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>We look forward to new opening to the nations of the South, with special
                            feelings towards these nations and to become more acceptable in these
                            countries—as Canada and the Prime Minister are. In Cuba, for example,
                            Canada has good relations, and could perhaps help us.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, we can work together on common issues, like transporting
                            the energy in the North Slope.<note n="4" xml:id="d73fn4">See <ref

                            some problems, like Law of the Sea, and fish; here we need to deal with
                            one another in a way that will get the maximum degree of harmony.
                            Secretary Richardson has been appointed as special representative to the
                            Law of the Sea negotiations, to show their importance. Other issues are
                            transportation, oil spills, water quality on the Great Lakes, St.

                            talks on these matters tomorrow to have an easy relationship. The Prime
                            Minister should feel free to phone the President to ask about U.S.
                            policies—such as towards Europe. And he would want to call and ask the
                            Prime Minister’s advice on Soviet issues, and other international
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the President wanted to speak of the long-term future of working
                            for peace. The United States is deeply committed here, particularly
                            because of the threat of atomic weapons. He has been in touch with
                            Soviet leaders, about SALT II, about getting reductions, leading on to
                            his Inaugural goal of eliminating nuclear weapons altogether.<note n="6"

                        <p>The President was also grateful to the long-standing partnership between
                            the two countries in the defense of the Continent; with Canada, together
                            we feel secure. So we can now talk about many issues, from the smallest
                            to the largest. Thank you again for coming to Washington.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Prime Minister</hi> replied that he was grateful,
                            so early in the new administration, to respond to the President’s desire
                            for a “neighborhood spirit.” The first steps had all been positive. The
                            Vice President had called; there had been contacts with the Secretary of
                            State, and with Zbigniew Brzezinski, and he had had lunch with
                            Ambassador Enders—some of which was about serious subjects!<note n="7"

                        <p>In past months, there had been many indications of good will between the
                            two countries. The relationship was managed at every level: the Prime
                            Minister did not have to intervene. He would, of course, call the
                            President as a “last resort”; but generally, on both international and
                            bilateral matters, all were easily dealt with, and it should continue
                            that way.</p>
                        <p>As far as Canada was concerned, both Presidents Ford and Nixon had
                            adopted a “fair approach” to relations with Canada, for which they were
                            grateful.</p>
                        <p>What is changing is the spirit and freshness with which the President is
                            looking at problems. Last year, international problems were largely
                            stalled, as countries waited for the new administration. Now they have
                            high expectations of the President. The Prime Minister hoped that the
                            President would not be too overburdened too soon, particularly since he
                            has so much weight on his shoulders. He was confident that the energy,
                            the newness, the sense of morality would lead to a new start on so many
                            problems—as with nuclear safeguards, which they had talked about in the
                            Oval Office before the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Thus it will be easier in other meetings—like NATO, the Summit, CIEC—for
                            them to reinforce one another, since they seemed to be on the same
                            wavelength.</p>
                        <p>There is great good will—only waiting to be challenged.</p>

                            discussed the pipeline. Canada wanted to further this project in a
                            spirit of cooperation. They had obligations under the law, however. He
                            and the President had talked of tankers and the Great Lakes water

                            one of the Canadian options, what assurance could the Prime Minister
                            give on the Indian problem that Canada had to deal with. Would it mean a
                            three or four year delay?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Prime Minister</hi> replied that one route was
                            easier in terms of Indian or environmental questions. With the Alcan,
                            there would be no problems; but they could arise with the Mackenzie
                            Valley pipeline. The President had posed a difficult question. It could
                            be answered more precisely once the results were in on the reports of
                            Judge Berger (April) and the National Energy Board (June).</p>
                        <p>Last night, both sides had agreed on a coordinating mechanism, with an

                            to act.</p>
                        <p>If both reports were positive, then it would be easy to decide—no
                            problems. If negative or dubious on environmental or Indian questions,
                            then there would be a difficult political problem. He did not know how
                            soon it could be solved. It was a chicken and egg issue. They already
                            had treaties with the Indians in the Mackenzie Valley. They had been
                            trying to solve it for years. Now the Indians have only to choose which
                            land they want. But since the oil finds in Prudhoe Bay, the Indians are
                            dragging their feet. It is a bluffing game.</p>

                            to be implemented. They have only to say what lands they want.</p>
                        <p>Even if the reports are negative, some Indians will go along, so that
                            they can demand compensation. James Bay,<note n="11" xml:id="d73fn11"

                            our help with oil through Portland, Maine, for Montreal. Thus Canada
                            does not wish to be mean, but there are problems. Were they being lax?
                            Or had he presented the only strategy for dealing with the Indian

                            without going into points of Canadian interest.</p>
                        <p>Regarding foreign investment, any is welcome, provided it is of
                            significant benefit to Canadians. This is both law and policy. They had
                            set up a screening mechanism in 1972 to insure that investment does
                            benefit Canada. More than 85% of applications from the U.S. were
                            approved, and only slightly less than that for other countries. Canada
                            is not trying to keep investment out—though they don’t want investment
                            that really is just using Canadian dollars to buy up industry, without
                            creating more jobs and opportunities. But this is not a serious problem.
                            And some of the provinces want more investment (creating jobs) for their

                            domination. It was a parallel in trade to theories of monopoly in market
                            economies. Thus the strongest economy is seen to dominate. (Of course,
                            this is sometimes true in Canada, too; there is something in what they
                            say, in relation to the U.S.!) The Europeans are not sure that lowered
                            trade barriers are good for them, in terms of the international division

                        <p>Did it apply to Canada and the U.S.? He was not always sure! As trade
                            barriers went down, it was clear that the U.S. would swamp them
                            overnight, unless they phased in the changes.</p>

                            economic problems, as those of other industrial democracies. There were
                            rising expectations, with people wanting wages to grow at the rate of
                            the past. But oil prices had gone up; there were third world demands,
                            environmental costs, more welfare, a desire to diversify the economy and
                            develop the less developed regions. Thus they had taken costly economic
                            decisions. As was learned with Japan, there is a danger of exporting the
                            environment; while Canada was trying to preserve its environment, which

                            the Prime Minister a volume of satellite photographs. He hoped it would
                            prove of interest and if photographs from American satellites could be
                            of any use to Canada—for instance for crop analysis—they would all be
                            made available. The Prime Minister thanked the President, asking if the
                            US had found any Canadian missile sites. After further lighthearted

                                agencies issued reports on plans to construct a pipeline to
                                transport natural gas from Alaska to the lower 48 states. On May 2,
                                the Federal Power Commission’s report favored either the Mackenzie
                                River Valley route or the Alaska Highway route. On May 9, Berger’s
                                report criticized the Mackenzie River Valley route and offered
                                qualified support for the Alaska Highway route. On July 4, the NEB
                                backed the Alaska Highway route. (Steven Rattner, “Gas Pipeline From

                            had worked out agreement down to the last details late on September

                            Minister with the President last February and this showed what could be
                            done by working together. One snag remained: what would follow brief
                            general statement to be issued on September 8 immediately after the
                            meeting. The Prime Minister understood that Dr. Schlesinger wanted to go
                            public that afternoon. He had to inform the President, however, that he
                            had spoken to MacEachen who was greatly distressed by this prospect and
                            did not believe Canada could be ready to handle its end of the publicity
                            today. For one thing, there was the need for a separate statement to get
                            the Indians on board, and there were also problems with British
                            Columbia. While these were internal questions and of no direct concern
                            to the US, it had to be noted that from the very beginning Canada had
                            acted consistently in order to meet the US timetable. MacEachen had a
                            firm understanding with Dr. Schlesinger that announcement in both
                            countries would be made at a time which was mutually suitable.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Schlesinger intervened to say he would call MacEachen. The Prime
                            Minister replied that it would be too late to turn off the afternoon
                            press conference if there were no agreement to go ahead with it. Dr.
                            Schlesinger replied that the US was not going to be public without
                            Canadian approval. The Prime Minister responded that a brief joint
                            statement was okay but that giving out details would have to wait at
                            least until tomorrow. Dr. Schlesinger explained that he was concerned
                            that an “information vacuum” left in the wake of a brief joint statement
                            would enable critics of the joint project to erode the agreement between
                            the two countries. At this point, the President intervened to say that
                            the US would not go public on details “until you say it is okay.” The
                            Prime Minister appreciated that and alluded again to the great
                            achievement since February. He observed that 12 hours might make the
                            difference. In any event it was one thing for the President and himself
                            to go out after the meeting and speak in brief general terms about the
                            achievement involved.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Dr. Schlesinger if the joint statement had been
                            cleared on both sides. On learning that his separate personal statement
                            to be read out during the ensuing press conference had not been cleared
                            with Canada, he asked Schlesinger to read it over the phone to
                            MacEachen. The Prime Minister demurred at the need for this, having
                            ascertained that no details or figures were included. The Prime Minister
                            then agreed that Dr. Schlesinger should talk to MacEachen, expressing
                            his own concern that the information might leak out in the wrong way
                            which could result in negative public reaction in Canada.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Schlesinger then left the room to call MacEachen, and he returned
                            shortly before the meeting ended. He reported that it had now been
                            agreed with MacEachen that details could be released the next day. Fact

                            plane. Finally, he said again that he would prefer to have a press
                            briefing before the weekend slipped by.<note n="7" xml:id="d74fn7"

                            nonproliferation.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Canadian-Latin American Relations</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President said “nothing would please us more than to
                            have you play a more active role in this Hemisphere.” The US, the
                            President asserted, needed Canada’s help—on human rights, nuclear
                            questions and in dealing with the nations of the Caribbean. Indicating
                            that he would not wish to press the Prime Minister in any way, the
                            President said that if Canada were itself inclined to be more active in
                            Hemisphere matters, the US would certainly encourage that.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that Canada tried to play a useful role where
                            it could. It tried, in fact, to exercise “a kind of influence,”
                            especially in the Caribbean. During the February meeting, he and the
                            President had discussed Jamaica and Belize and Canada tried to extend
                            its policy in Latin America. It already has deeply involved the
                            Caribbean. So the desire for expanded relations was there. The only
                            question was how to go about it. The Prime Minister wondered if the
                            President was about to raise the question of Canadian membership in the
                            OAS. If that was where his remarks were leading, the Prime Minister
                            wanted to say at once that “the whole thing was being reviewed”. Was the
                            OAS, in fact, a valid instrument for Canadian purposes, the Prime
                            Minister asked rhetorically. Canada had received conflicting advice from
                            different participants. The Prime Minister said that Canada would not
                            wish to involve itself further with OAS until it was convinced that it
                            was the right thing to do. But meanwhile Canada tried to show its
                            interest in various ways. His attendance at Canal treaties signing
                            ceremony, which associated Canada with the treaties, was part of that
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that at the outset of his discussions with
                            President Torrijos about the Canal treaties signing ceremony, the latter
                            had urged the US to work on Canada to ensure that Prime Minister Trudeau
                            attended. Canada was the first country Torrijos mentioned. The President
                            sensed that the Latin American states in general would like Canada to be
                            part of OAS and to share its responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister speculated that the Latin Americans might be attracted
                            to Canada because of its “third option” policy which had involved Canada
                            distancing itself from the US—for instance, in economic and cultural
                            matters. Fortunately, this had caused no real problems for US–Canadian
                            relations. But the Prime Minister was not sure whether it was in the
                            American interest to encourage the Latin Americans to coalesce with
                            Canada against the United States. Summing up, the Prime Minister said
                            that Canada had no objection to the OAS if Canada could play a positive
                            role. Foreign Minister Jamieson added that the timing of any decisions
                            would be affected by the end of review of the problem. There was no
                            unanimity in Latin American on the question so far.<note n="8"

                                wrote: “I asked State to follow-up your expression of interest in
                                having Canada play a larger role in the Inter-American system, and
                                they have provided a strategy paper which suggests that we move
                                slowly to build Canadian interest in such areas as: the multilateral
                                effort to develop the Caribbean, human rights, peace-keeping
                                activities, more technical assistance and scholarships, particularly
                                to benefit the poor in middle-income countries.” In response to
                                Carter’s notation on that memorandum, in a December 5 memorandum to
                                Vance, Brzezinski asked him to add non-proliferation to the list.

                            Secretary Vance replied that he was uncertain of the status of the
                            issue. The Prime Minister said that many non-governmental organizations
                            have members on both sides of the border. If those kinds of
                            relationships are to continue, it would be helpful if the US changed its
                            law. The President suggested that the Prime Minister express his own
                            view. He could not promise what the US might be able to do, noting that
                            there had been many abuses in the previous convention tax law. What was
                            necessary was more general tax reform.<note n="12" xml:id="d74fn12">See

                        <p>The Prime Minister said he wanted to mention the issue of
                            extraterritoriality of US antitrust law. Attorney General Bell had
                            visited Canada, and that was helpful, but later in a speech he had used
                            the “big stick.”<note n="13" xml:id="d74fn13">Reference is to Bell’s

                                with U.S. antitrust investigations of the oil and uranium industries
                                and noted that lack of cooperation might result in less U.S.
                                cooperation with foreign investigations and also influence “our

                            channels, not through US laws and US courts. Secretary Vance agreed that
                            the issue needed a push. The President asked for a memorandum on the

                                    offered no firm views on his choice of a successor. He said that

                        <p>The primary political substance, so far as Trudeau is concerned, will be
                            the fact of the meeting itself. He wants to remind the Canadian public
                            that its country’s most important foreign connection is in good shape;
                            he expects the visibility of his meeting with you to achieve that
                            purpose—thereby winning him political points in his election campaign.

                            expanding its natural gas sales in the U.S. market. It will be helpful
                            for you to raise the Alaska Pipeline issue with Trudeau, stressing the
                            need to hold costs down in order to keep Congress in line; we count on
                            working closely with the Canadians to that end. (C)</p>
                        <p>Among the larger international issues, I recommend that you emphasize
                            Iran, the situation in Indochina, and our relationship with the Soviets.
                            Regarding the latter, you should know that last week Canadian Ambassador
                            Towe delivered a speech before the Minnesota State Legislature in which
                            he expressed his government’s strong support for SALT II. This was the
                            first public expression of Canada’s official position, and I believe it
                            would be very useful for you to ask Trudeau to repeat it if and when you
                            two meet briefly with the press following lunch.<note n="7"

                            security problem); and b) the fact that Guadeloupe in no way infringed
                            upon the scope of discussions likely to concern Canada at the Tokyo

                        <p>To govern as PM, however, Clark will have to negotiate support from

                            New Democratic Party—which will be sure to demand implementation of its
                            own programs as the price for support. The problems of melding rather
                            different Tory and NDP philosophies could be overcome, at least for the
                            short term, by the two parties’ mutual desire to take power in Ottawa
                            after years in the wilderness. (U)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Clark and his Party</p>
                        <p>Joe Clark is described as intelligent, but not dazzlingly so; pragmatic;
                            cautious; someone who seeks and takes advice, but makes his own
                            decisions. His major problem is one of image. He lacks charisma, appears
                            somewhat stuffy, suffers the handicap of youth, and on more than one
                            occasion has provided a merciless press—and the Liberal Party—with
                            incidents or statements to lampoon. (C)</p>
                        <p>Clark excels in organizational ability. When he became leader of the
                            Tories three years ago, he took over a fractious, divided party that
                            regularly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory through its public
                            feuding and internal backbiting.</p>
                        <p>Clark has successfully unified the party and demonstrates impressive,
                            though by no means complete, control over the Tory caucus in Parliament.
                            The rise in party fortunes has attracted better people into its ranks,
                            and some of these are part of the Tory front bench in Parliament. The
                            U.S. Embassy assesses those he would probably appoint to ministerial
                            positions as inexperienced but, by and large, a loyal, dedicated, and
                            competent group of individuals. (C)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">National Unity</p>
                        <p>This remains Canada’s (and Clark’s) prime concern. Clark has become
                            increasingly confident on this issue and has laid out a program that he
                            believes will both defuse the Quebec separatist question and the
                            discontent of some of the anglophone provinces. He claims he can
                            overcome the much ballyhooed “French-English split” by appointing
                            francophones to his government. He will have to appoint from outside the
                            ranks of Parliament, since only two Tory incumbents were reelected from
                            Quebec. Clark also plans to call a federal-provincial conference on
                            constitutional reform before Quebec can hold its referendum on
                            sovereignty-association, now expected in late 1979 or early 1980, “to
                            show Quebecers it is possible for this new government to get some new
                            movement in the federal-provincial impasse.” (C)</p>

                        <p>Clark has not yet really focused on foreign policy, but what he has said
                            indicates some change in three areas: relations with the United States,
                            defense spending, and relations with Israel.<note n="5" xml:id="d77fn5"
                                >In telegram 2523 from Ottawa, the Embassy reported: “Joe Clark

                                and he is generally a novice in these areas. His principal
                                preoccupations, as he assumes the new prime ministership, are: to
                                organize the Conservatives as the governing party after 16 years out
                                of power; to deal with the problem of Quebec; and to get the economy

                            he admired his calm and restraint during the present Iranian

                            that he did not want to discuss these matters over the telephone.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Clark asked President Carter to have Ambassador Peter Towe
                            kept informed about the Iranian situation, particularly if there are any
                            policy changes. Prime Minister Clark indicated that better liaison
                            between U.S. government officials and Ambassador Towe might be
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Clark volunteered to offer any liaison assistance with
                            leaders of other countries. President Carter responded that both the
                            Canadians and the Egyptians had been extremely helpful. He indicated
                            that the U.K., France, Japan, and the FRG were helpful, but they could
                            do more. President Carter made it clear that he was not being critical
                            of the leaders of these four countries, but was simply pointing out that
                            they did only what they were asked to do, nothing more. Prime Minister
                            Clark said he understood and volunteered to follow-up with Thatcher,
                            Giscard, Ohira, and Schmidt on a strictly personal basis, not involving
                            the U.S. in any way.</p>
                        <p>President Carter and Prime Minister Clark then engaged in brief
                            discussion of Canadian and U.S. domestic politics. Prime Minister Clark
                            indicated that “my hunch is that the Canadian people want a government,”
                            and he intends to give them one. President Carter remarked about his
                            recent favorable performance relative to that of Senator Kennedy.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Clark then turned the conversation to the West-to-East oil

                                under consideration: a) the “Foothills” pipeline, which would bring
                                the oil to the United States directly overland through Canada; b)
                                the “Northern Tier” pipeline, which would transport oil across U.S.
                                territory from Port Angeles, Washington to Chicago, Illinois; and c)
                                the “Trans-Mountain” pipeline which would move oil from Port Angeles
                                through both Canada and the United States. (Memorandum from Owen to

                            President Carter said that the Foothills approach was unacceptable.
                            Foothills had been considered and rejected in the findings of the

                            pressed the President on this issue: “Is it the position of your
                            government that Foothills is out?” President Carter said “yes.”
                            President Carter said that the choice was now reduced to the northern
                            tier vs. the transmountain approach. Prime Minister Clark indicated that
                            the Canadian Government was concerned about symmetrical treatment of
                            these two competing proposals. He expressed concern that the northern
                            tier approach, an all-U.S. pipeline system, might receive more favorable
                            treatment. President Carter said that treatment of the proposals would
                            be evenhanded.<note n="6" xml:id="d78fn6">Carter underlined the phrase
                                “would be evenhanded,” and wrote in the margin: “No. I said both

                                Tier.”</note> He suggested to Prime Minister Clark that financing is
                            the key issue. If the Canadian authorities hear anything about how the
                            finance committee<note n="7" xml:id="d78fn7">Carter drew a line through
                                the word “committee.” In the margin he wrote the word “community,”
                                which he circled, and from which he drew an arrow pointing at the
                                word “committee.”</note> feels about these two proposals, this
                            information should be shared with their U.S. counterparts.</p>
                        <p>President Carter informed Prime Minister Clark that he had requested a
                            60-day extension on this decision, an extension which is permissible
                            under the appropriate statute.<note n="8" xml:id="d78fn8">Reference is

                        <p>Prime Minister Clark asked if there would be any public announcement by
                            the U.S.G. concerning the reduction of three pipeline options to two
                            options. President Carter said that there was no appropriate forum<note

                            such an announcement but that Prime Minister Clark should feel free to
                            quote him as a result of this conversation.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Clark then turned to the subject of cancellation of the
                            November 9–10 trip to Ottawa.<note n="10" xml:id="d78fn10">Carter

                            didn’t want to press the President, but that he would very much like the
                            President to come to Canada when the circumstances are appropriate.
                            President Carter expressed his deep regret at having to cancel his trip
                            and said he very much wanted to visit Canada. He indicated that
                            appropriate officials on both sides should be able to produce
                            satisfactory time for the visit, when the present uncertainty is
                            over.</p>
                        <p>President Carter then turned to the security issues and the use of
                            weapons by special agents. Prime Minister Clark indicated that the
                            morale of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was quite low and
                            that unfortunately the security issue has become tangled with a morale
                            issue. Prime Minister Clark indicated that if he appeared to give in, it
                            would be bad for the Mounties’ morale. Prime Minister Clark did
                            indicate, however, that “in light of extraordinary present
                            circumstances,” i.e., the Iranian situation, the Canadians might be able
                            to make some special accommodation for a Presidential visit. President
                            Carter indicated that he would be willing to invite officials of the
                            RCMP down to Washington to talk with him about the problem.<note n="11"

                            concerned that part of the difficulty was an inherited problem from the

                            apparently criticized security arrangements by the RCMP after President
                            Nixon’s trip to Canada. President Carter indicated that the U.S. had an
                            unfortunate history of security problems for national leaders and that
                            one result of this history was the development of special expertise;
                            e.g., the USSS has developed special techniques in crowd
                                monitoring.<note n="12" xml:id="d78fn12">At the end of this

                                wrote another asterisk and the following sentence: “Including esp.

                            Minister Clark accepted the point and suggested that the appropriate way
                            to make progress on this matter was to have Ambassador Towe continue
                            discussions with appropriate U.S. officials. President Carter indicated
                            that since the USSS came under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the
                            Treasury, it might be sensible to take advantage of Ambassador Towe’s
                            friendship with Secretary Miller and have these two men discuss this
                            matter. Prime Minister Clark agreed.</p>
                        <p>The President closed the conversation by thanking the Prime Minister
                            again for his courageous and invaluable help during the present crisis

                        <p>On January 2, 1980, I met with Deputy Foreign Secretary Alan Gotlieb for
                            approximately one hour and forty-five minutes starting at 3 p.m. in his
                            office in Ottawa. Accompanying me were Ambassador Curtis [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]. Accompanying Gotlieb were
                            Undersecretary Pat Black, Executive Assistant to the Minister Hugh
                            Hanson and Bureau Chief Michael Shenstone.</p>
                        <p>I told Gotlieb that we very much appreciated their agreement to meet with
                            us on short notice. The President and the Secretary were extremely
                            grateful for the cooperation that the Canadian Government had provided
                            to us in dealing with the Iranian situation, notably in sheltering the
                            six official Americans. We are fully aware of the risks and dangers to
                            Canadian personnel, property and interests stemming from their
                            assistance to us. Although we had not previously wanted to press the
                            Canadians on finding ways to exfiltrate the six, we were becoming
                            increasingly concerned that their continued safety in Canadian Embassy
                            premises could now become jeopardized: (1) an increasing number of
                            journalists know that some official Americans are hiding in a friendly
                            mission; (2) the application of Chapter VII sanctions by Western
                                countries<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">On December 31, 1979, the
                                United Nations Security Council voted to impose sanctions against
                                Iran under articles 39 and 41 in Chapter VII of the United Nations
                                Charter if Iran did not release the hostages by January 7. (Bernard
                                D. Nossiter, “U.N. Council, 11 to 0, Gives Iran One Week to Let

                                1, 1980, p. 6)</note> could lead both to greater surveillance and
                            harassment of embassies, and the drawdown of Western embassy personnel,
                            thereby increasing the risks that the presence of the six will be
                            exposed; and (3) the staging of trials of U.S. personnel could intensify
                            a hunt for missing U.S. officials and make it impossible for us to
                            negotiate their departure from Tehran.</p>
                        <p>I explained that the urgency of the present situation convinced us of the
                            need to accelerate our contingency planning for removing the six from
                            Tehran. We hoped to have a plan agreed to by the American and Canadian
                            Governments that could be rapidly executed when officials of our
                            governments agreed that we had to act. Even though we could not now
                            predict exactly when the six should leave, we need an agreed scenario
                            given the complications of the preparations involved.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I indicated that after thorough study of the options, we had
                            concluded that the six had the best chance of leaving by the Tehran
                            airport if they had Canadian documentation. The details of the plan
                            would have to be worked out by experts in both governments, and the six
                            would have to be fully briefed and express a willingness to leave by
                            this risky route. Nonetheless, we wanted to have Canadian Government
                            agreement in principle to our request that the six might be given
                            Canadian passports. Were there unsurmountable legal or constitutional
                            problems to this request?</p>
                        <p>Gotlieb responded that his government very much appreciated the words of
                            gratitude which I had brought from the President and the Secretary. He
                            would pass them on immediately to the Prime Minister and Minister
                            MacDonald. If Minister MacDonald had not been in Kingston
                                campaigning,<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">On December 13, 1979,
                                Clark’s government lost a vote of confidence by 139 to 133; the next
                                day, elections were called for February 18, 1980. (Henry Giniger,

                            Canadian Government was glad to have the opportunity to cooperate with
                            us in this sensitive operation since it wanted to share our burdens at
                            this time of national trial. Gotlieb found our assessment of the
                            increasing dangers to the six extremely timely and he agreed completely
                            with our conclusions. Canada would become an increasing target of Iran’s
                            attention in coming weeks for reasons beyond the valid ones that we had
                            presented because it is: (1) the protecting power for Israel; (2) an
                            active participant in Western financial and economic pressures on Iran;
                            (3) the initiator of the Commonwealth appeal that Iran free the
                            hostages; and (4) because harsh public condemnation of Iran will
                            increase as the Canadian political campaign develops in coming weeks.
                            Gotlieb added that there is a strong public and political current in
                            Canada favoring much stronger actions against Iran if the hostages are
                            not released. Until now, the Iranian authorities have not appeared to
                            notice Canada’s growing role in the measures being carried out to
                            pressure the Tehran regime to free the hostages, but the time would come
                            when Iran could be expected to retaliate against Canada, which could
                            also expose the six to greater dangers.</p>
                        <p>Gotlieb went on to say that his government had been concerned that the
                            U.S. was not paying sufficient high-level attention to the plight of the
                            six, but that this impression had been completely dispelled as a result
                            of Secretary Vance’s conversation with Minister MacDonald<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d79fn4">On December 13, 1979, Vance was scheduled to meet
                                with MacDonald in Brussels, which both of them visited to attend a
                                special meeting of Foreign and Defense Ministers on December 11–12
                                and the NAC on December 13–14, 1979. No memorandum of conversation
                                for their meeting has been found. (Telegram 321018 to the

                                Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D790573–0365)</note>
                            and my trip to Ottawa. Until now, the Canadian Government had concluded
                            that it was safer for everyone involved for the six to remain in place.
                            However, conditions were changing and a plan for exfiltrating them
                            should be decided promptly. Gotlieb said that he personally would feel
                            much more comfortable if Canada could close down its Embassy in Tehran
                            and make arrangements for the six to leave as part of a general exodus
                            of Canadians from Iran. If no Canadian officials were left in Tehran,
                            Ottawa would be less concerned about possible reprisals if the six were
                            caught trying to leave the country with false Canadian passports. Canada
                            might also consider drawing down its personnel in the Embassy (now 18
                            persons) in Tehran to a skeleton staff of volunteers so that fewer
                            Canadians would be in danger in Tehran if the six were discovered or the
                            Embassy was invaded for other reasons.</p>
                        <p>On the question of providing Canadian documentation, Gotlieb said that he
                            would study the matter but that he foresaw no great juridical hurdles.
                            The decision to provide Canadian passports could probably be made in the
                            context of an agreed exfiltration plan that would subject the six and
                            Canadian personnel in Tehran to the minimum number of risks.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Gotlieb asked that we consider some other aspects of the
                            problem. How valuable was it for the U.S. to keep the Canadian Embassy
                            open for other reasons, [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
                                declassified</hi>]. He suggested that both governments reflect on
                            the three dimensions of the problem (removing the six, closing the
                            Embassy [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>])
                            together, since there might have to be trade-offs when a final plan for
                            exfiltrating the six was agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>We then discussed the possibility of moving the six to other friendly
                            embassies in Tehran, but Gotlieb seemed persuaded by the argument that
                            it likely would be much more difficult for us to exfiltrate them from
                            another mission than it is under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>It was also agreed that we would pass a message through Ambassador Taylor
                            to the six from the Department explaining the reasons why we had begun
                            contingency planning for exfiltrating them from Tehran and soliciting
                            their views.<note n="5" xml:id="d79fn5">Telegrams 3207 and 3933 to
                                Ottawa, January 5 and 6, conveyed Vance’s message regarding the
                                contingency plans for exfiltration of the six U.S. diplomats (which
                                was to be transmitted through Gotlieb and Taylor). Telegram 4105 to

                                reported that Taylor had delivered Vance’s message to the six but
                                had omitted the sentences with details about exfiltration planning.

                                Secretary Johnston accompanied by Embassy officials, met with senior
                                Canadian ExtAff officials to review current situation and entire
                                range of bilateral and multilateral actions affecting Afghanistan,
                                Iran and Pakistan. Canadians stated they were willing and able to
                                take most of the measures we proposed, but stressed that it would be
                                politically impossible to do so in the absence of Western
                                solidarity. Failure to develop Western solidarity would be a
                                damaging signal to the Soviet Union. Canadians saw major problems in
                                securing cooperation of Western Europeans in the trade field,
                                particularly with respect to the Soviet Union. They suggested a
                                multilateral meeting at the political level to sort out what could,
                                jointly and selectively, be done. They also suggested proposing an
                                Austrian-like neutralization of Afghanistan in order to expose the
                                hypocrisy of the Soviet position. End summary.</item>

                            <item>Iran: Ambassador Habib opened discussion by stressing that USG’s
                                primary and overriding objective remains the release of the
                                hostages. Nothing was possible unless they were released but many
                                things became possible once they were released. We could not accept
                                a situation whereby release was conditional on the completion of
                                other actions, e.g., following a UN inquiry commission. We have made
                                this position fully clear to the Iranians through a wide range of
                                intermediaries. It was our judgment that an increase of
                                international pressure on Iran would be the best way to assist those
                                rational elements in Iran who appreciated the problems that Iran
                                faced and who could ultimately persuade those with authority in Iran
                                that release of the hostages was necessary. Our request of the
                                international community was absolutely clear, i.e., we wish the
                                community to implement the sanctions contained in the Security
                                Council’s resolution which had been vetoed by the Soviet Union.<note

                            <item>On Afghanistan, Ambassador Habib stated that our objective was to
                                make the invasion of Afghanistan sufficiently costly for the Soviet
                                Union so that it would (A) withdraw its troops and (B) not take
                                similar action elsewhere. In order to do this we had restricted U.S.
                                export of agricultural products, requested that other free-world
                                suppliers not undercut us, and had suggested a variety of financial,
                                trade and other measures which were designed to impact on the Soviet
                                Union. We were asking that there be no exceptions to the new COCOM
                                lists (except for computers where there would be no exceptions to
                                the old list until it could be renegotiated). On Afghanistan itself,
                                the USG sought a suspension of bilateral and multilateral
                                assistance. Our other objective was to minimize the danger to the
                                surrounding areas, most immediately to Pakistan.</item>

                            <item>We believe that it is necessary to strengthen substantially
                                Pakistan, militarily, economically, and politically/psychologically.
                                Ambassador Habib described the USG package which had been presented
                                to the Pakistanis and which was currently being discussed with the
                                Congress. He also reviewed our efforts to coordinate military
                                assistance with other countries and to avoid an undesirable Indian
                                reaction. He stated that we favored debt-rescheduling for Pakistan
                                within the context of an IMF agreement on economic reforms if it
                                looks as though an emerging default situation is likely. Our overall
                                objective was to secure an increase in consortium pledges for
                                Pakistan from the current 800 million dollars to the 1.4 billion
                                dollar level. Those countries such as Japan and Germany, not in a
                                position to assist militarily, were being asked to contribute more
                                on the economic side. He noted that we had asked Japan for a
                                quadrupling of its assistance. The USG hoped that Canada could
                                double its assistance, i.e., move from 50 to 100 million
                                dollars.</item>

                            <item>In responding, the Canadians stressed that they were speaking as
                                officials, but it seems to us that all of their positions, with one
                                possible exception noted below, reflect at least informal
                                discussions with Ministers. Despite the fact that Canada faces an
                                election on Feb. 18, they appeared confident that the views they
                                reflected would probably be the Canadian views after the election,
                                no matter who won.</item>

                            <item>Under Secretary Gotlieb made three general points on the Canadian
                                approach to Iran/Afghanistan. First, the GOC fully understood the
                                USG position and supported our objectives. They were aware of the
                                tremendous domestic pressures under which the President was
                                operating and appreciated the moderation in the USG response.
                                Second, they were concerned that the USG was asking its friends and
                                allies to undertake more than was politically feasible. The
                                Europeans were not willing at present to take the steps we had
                                proposed. Under these circumstances there was the danger that Iran
                                and the Soviet Union, as well as other concerned countries, would
                                ultimately draw the conclusion that there was no comprehensive Free
                                World willingness to respond to situations such as prevailed in Iran
                                and Afghanistan. Third, and closely related to the second point, the
                                GOC believed that the USG should accept more selectivity in the
                                response of individual countries to the Iranian and Afghan
                                situations.</item>

                            <item>Gotlieb expressed concern that the present system of bilateral and
                                multilateral consultations was inadequate. He suggested that a
                                multilateral meeting, at the political level, was required to assure
                                that everyone knew what the others were doing, and to bind
                                governments to effective action. On timing, he suggested that no
                                further action be taken with respect to Iranian sanctions until we
                                can see whether Iranian policy had been influenced by the Islamic
                                Summit meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">Reference is to the

                            <item>On Iranian sanctions, Gotlieb reiterated understanding for the
                                USG’s objective, but expressed strong doubt that there was
                                sufficient political will in Western Europe to impose an effective
                                multilateral sanctions system. He expressed concern that, if
                                sanctions failed, it would demonstrate to Iran and the Soviet Union
                                that they had nothing to fear in the way of a joint Western
                                response, and the USG would be forced to consider a military
                                response. Gotlieb further expressed doubt that sanctions would
                                strengthen the hand of those forces in Iran who wanted to resolve
                                the problem either for domestic reasons or because of fear of the
                                Soviet Union and its cohorts inside Iran. Ambassador Habib reviewed
                                the USG position and the reasons for this position, and the
                                discussion shifted to the possible Canadian response to the USG
                                request.</item>

                            <item>Deputy Under Secretary Johnstone stated that the GOC presently had
                                the legal basis to restrict exports to Iran in any way it wished. In
                                fact, Canadian trade had decreased sharply to 15 million dollars
                                from earlier levels of 150–200 million dollars. The political
                                prerequisite for trade restrictions was concerted action by major
                                allies. The GOC had similar powers with respect to the use of
                                Canadian carriers for such trade. On banking, Johnstone stated that
                                there was no legal basis for mandatory action, but the GOC had
                                requested voluntary action and so far had experienced no problems.
                                On service contracts, the federal government had limited authority
                                and it seemed questionable whether much could be done in this area
                                other than to request voluntary compliance.</item>

                                    measures against Iran such as making no new credits to Iran,
                                    declaring Iran in default if payments were late, and declaring
                                    defaults on other loans having cross-default clauses. (National

                                financially exposed in this area and doubted that other countries
                                were, in fact, pressing their banks to cooperate. On the issue of
                                default, he asserted that U.S. banks had not been helpful. In at
                                least one recent case, where a U.S. bank was the agent for a
                                consortium including Canadian banks, Iran had made the required
                                payment but the U.S. bank had not passed on the payment to the
                                Canadian participants. (Deputy Asst. Secretary Johnston pointed out
                                that this was in accord with U.S. law.) Johnstone raised the
                                question whether Iran was in fact legally in default when it had
                                made payment to the agent and wondered what practical recourse was
                                available to Canadian banks.</item>

                                have a particularly adverse effect on Canada. He noted that the
                                system was based on consumption rather than imports and that
                                countries with relatively low import levels such as Canada might be
                                required to give up a high percentage of their import levels in
                                order to assist countries with large imports such as Japan. He noted
                                that if the cooperative system had been based on imports rather than
                                consumption, Canada would not face this problem.</item>

                            <item>Gotlieb and the other Canadian officials repeatedly advanced the
                                assessment that the Europeans did not presently have the political
                                will to cooperate in sanctions against Iran. In order to avoid
                                giving an impression of weakness, it was therefore desirable for
                                much closer multilateral coordination to determine what was
                                possible. In the ensuing discussion, Ambassador Habib expressed
                                doubt that the timing was ripe for a high-level multilateral
                                meeting, but this idea should certainly be considered at some
                                point.</item>

                            <item>With respect to Afghanistan, Gotlieb stated that the GOC had no
                                problems with most of the steps suggested by the USG. The only area
                                which caused major problems was that relating to export credits. The
                                Canadian line of credit to the Soviet Union had expired and the
                                Cabinet had decided not to replace it for now. However, the GOC
                                still had to decide on case by case applications, and there were
                                particular problems relating to commitments already existing or “in
                                the pipeline.” Deputy Under Secretary Johnstone stated that, in his
                                view, unlike the U.S., the elimination of new official credits meant
                                the end of Canadian exports to the Soviet Union. He asserted that
                                other countries did not appear willing to forego official credits.
                                For example, the UK was continuing to approve specific loans under
                                the existing line of credit and the Canadian Government would be
                                almost certain to take similar action unless the Europeans and
                                Japanese changed their policies.</item>

                            <item>With respect to oil equipment, Johnstone asked whether the USG had
                                considered the impact of curtailing exports of oil production
                                equipment on the Soviet Union’s need to acquire oil on world
                                markets, and whether such action could increase the likelihood of
                                Soviet attempt to take over oil resources in the Middle East.
                                Ambassador Habib and Deputy Asst Secretary Johnston replied that
                                considerable thought had been given to the subject.</item>

                            <item>Deputy Under Secretary Goldschlag, stating that he was speaking
                                personally, asked whether consideration had been given to a
                                diplomatic initiative in relation to Afghanistan. He and other
                                Canadian officials noted that, if it were not for the situation in
                                Iran, we would have wonderful rallying call for anti-Soviet feeling
                                by Islamic countries. He wondered whether it would be useful to
                                propose to the Soviet Union an agreement declaring Afghanistan a
                                neutral and non-aligned country, on the model of Austria, with all
                                foreign military presence barred. It was unlikely that the Soviet
                                Union would accept this proposal but its rejection would expose the
                                hypocrisy of the Soviet assertion that it had entered Afghanistan in
                                order to protect it from other countries. Ambassador Habib stated
                                that this was a new idea which would be considered.</item>

                                and the GOC was currently looking into the possibility. The initial
                                assessment indicated there were major problems and costs, but a
                                final report would be available by the end of the week. Ambassador
                                Habib and Ambassador Curtis reviewed USG position and noted that the

                                cutbacks in the overall level of Canadian aid funding had required
                                reductions in the bilateral program with Pakistan. Gotlieb stated
                                that the best we could hope for would be a continuation of the GOC
                                program at roughly the 50-million dollar level. On a more positive
                                note, he said the GOC was taking action to institute an aid program
                                to Turkey. Ambassador Habib expressed disappointment and asked the
                                GOC to reconsider. In view of the need, we believed the level of
                                Canadian assistance to Pakistan should be doubled.</item>

                                Brzezinski’s memorandum, Carter directed that Brzezinski and Vance

                                opportunity for bilateral talks at the June G–7 Summit in Venice.

                        <p>I was pleased by your comments on Afghanistan. We see no evidence at the
                            moment that the Soviets have abandoned their plans to set up a
                            controlled, pro-Soviet regime in that country or that they are prepared
                            to consider a political solution involving the total withdrawal of
                            Soviet forces. But I would welcome a solution of the kind you favor,
                            involving a neutral, non-aligned, unoccupied Afghanistan, and I
                            appreciate Canada’s efforts toward that end. Our two governments and
                            others with the same views should continue to consult on this issue and
                            to remain alert for any sign of a change in Soviet policy.</p>
                        <p>We are grateful for Canada’s role in the Western response to the Soviet
                            invasion. It is vital to the success of our efforts that the Soviets
                            perceive a consistent, determined, and coordinated response to their
                            aggression. Your position on export credits and on high technology
                            exports has helped to demonstrate that the Allies will not continue to
                            do business as usual. I have noted Canada’s decision to keep grain
                            exports to the Soviet Union at normal levels and not make up the
                            shortfalls caused by reductions in United States grain sales.</p>
                        <p>We must also emphasize our support for friendly nations in the area such
                            as Pakistan and Turkey, as well as our common commitment to improving
                            NATO defenses. I have asked Cy Vance to discuss these subjects in detail
                            when he meets with External Affairs Minister MacGuigan this month.<note

                        <p>I share your concern about the financing of the gas pipeline, but I want
                            to reaffirm my determination to press ahead on this project as quickly
                            as possible. Alaskan gas reserves are essential to the United States.

                        <p>I hope, too, that we can continue to count on Canadian support for our

                            ambitious targets for alternative energy supplies. It will be difficult
                            for me to maintain public support for the rigorous measures we are now
                            taking to restrain demand and increase supply unless this effort is seen
                            as part of broader international actions.</p>

                            These treaties are clearly in the interests of both our countries, and
                            we will make every effort to obtain Senate approval.</p>

                            <item>Summary: The main subject of discussion between Secretary Muskie
                                and Canadian Foreign Minister MacGuigan in their May 14 bilateral
                                was the fisheries treaty. MacGuigan said Canadians were not prepared
                                to accept many changes to the treaty. Secretary pointed out that
                                treaty could not be ratified in its present form because of strong
                                opposition in the Senate. This was a political fact. There were
                                three proposed reservations to the treaty, and both Canada and the
                                U.S. needed to use their collective ingenuity to find accommodation.
                                A supporter in the Senate also needed to be found. He promised to
                                get back to MacGuigan on this. Other subjects discussed briefly were
                                wheat; the Quebec referendum, and the Olympics. End summary.</item>

                                the U.S. Mission to NATO on May 14.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2"
                                    >Muskie and MacGuigan were in Brussels to attend a special
                                    session of NATO’s Defense Policy Committee on May 13–14 in which
                                    foreign and defense ministers participated.</note> Present on
                                the Canadian side were Sullivan, Senior Departmental Assistant to
                                Secretary of State for External Affairs and Ambassador Hardy,
                                Canadian PermRep. Present on the U.S. side were Assistant Secretary

                                notetaker. After opening pleasantries and praise from both men for
                                former Secretary Vance, MacGuigan said that Secretary Muskie will
                                find Canadian policy supportive. Our aim is generally to keep it
                                that way. MacGuigan cited as an example the Canadian decision to
                                boycott the Olympics.<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">See <ref

                            <item>Secretary Muskie asked if there were any problems and cited the
                                fisheries treaty. MacGuigan said that was indeed the main problem
                                and asked what could be done in the Senate. Secretary replied that
                                support is needed from the Senators from the affected states. He
                                noted that while in the Senate he had supported the treaty. He had
                                attempted to try to represent the views of his state’s fisheries,
                                and on the whole they could live with it. But the affected fishermen
                                from southern New England had a different view. Secretary did not
                                see support for the treaty at this point. Senator Kennedy<note n="4"
                                    xml:id="d83fn4">Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
                                    D-Massachusetts.</note> had tabled three reservations and
                                Senator Pell,<note n="5" xml:id="d83fn5">Senator Claiborne Pell,
                                    D-Rhode Island.</note> a strong opponent, wanted the
                                reservations adopted. The United States needs to get back to Canada
                                on this matter, but if the Canadians want the treaty exactly in its
                                present form it will be a different road.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>MacGuigan said that Canadians were not prepared to make many
                                changes, although some small alterations might be acceptable. The
                                problem is that if there is no treaty it is bad primarily for the
                                fishing situation. The U.S. is now overfishing and if there is no
                                treaty Canadian fishermen will begin to do so as well. Secretary
                                responded that views at the moment in the Senate were set in
                                concrete. MacGuigan asked if we were contemplating getting support
                                from other Senators from other states. Muskie said that U.S.
                                Senators are generally inclined to follow their colleagues from the
                                affected states. The East Coast is affected just about as far south
                                as the Carolinas. The West Coast Senators won’t go against their
                                East Coast brethren, unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
                                The Senators want good relations with Canada but this is not
                                sufficient to get them to accept the current treaty. The opponents
                                say they want a treaty, but not this one. They say what they want in
                                the treaty, but they are not prepared to say what they will give up.
                                Much the same kind of debate occurred during the SALT discussions.
                                The Secretary said he understood what MacGuigan was saying and will
                                use the points that he had made. He wanted to give MacGuigan,
                                however, the hard nut political facts as he saw it. It was hard
                                enough to get hearings on the treaty.<note n="6" xml:id="d83fn6">On
                                    April 15, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began hearings

                            <item>MacGuigan commented that Canadian fishermen are the same as
                                American. The difference seems to be the Canadian Government does
                                not pay as much attention to their complaints as the U.S. does.
                                Secretary responded that he wasn’t sure this was the case since the
                                Canadian Government provided subsidies to their fishermen. The
                                attention paid was a different kind.</item>

                            <item>MacGuigan then asked what initiatives were being contemplated in
                                this area. The Secretary replied that there had been two days of
                                Senate hearings. He did not think that more hearings would be
                                productive. There was no spokesman in the Senate now for the treaty.
                                Senator Sarbanes<note n="7" xml:id="d83fn7">Senator Paul Sarbanes,
                                    D-Maryland.</note> was a possibility, the Secretary thought.
                                MacGuigan said that he might approach Sarbanes. The Secretary
                                repeated that he did not see the parochial interests involved being
                                influenced by broad appeals to the need for good relations with
                                Canada. MacGuigan asked what could be done. Muskie said it was a
                                fact that the treaty can’t be ratified in its present form. What
                                modifications could the Canadians accept? MacGuigan responded that
                                Secretary Vance had told him while in Ottawa that the administration
                                would fight for the treaty as it is and try to bring it to a vote.
                                There might be the need for some small changes. MacGuigan said he
                                had told Vance that if the changes were small, the Canadians would
                                take a look at them.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>Secretary said there were three issues involved with the Kennedy
                                reservations to the treaty. The first dealt with the nature of the
                                treaty. The opponents did not want to be locked in to a permanent
                                treaty and thus wanted to have the provision included for another
                                look at it in three years. The Secretary said he thought this was
                                better than no treaty at all. The second reservation regarded the
                                Canadian request for a change in boundary claims affecting the
                                external area for scallop fishing. Treaty opponents see this as
                                without justification and we will have to deal with this issue. The
                                third issue was the question of Canadian management rights over U.S.
                                fishing grounds. This also was seen by the opponents as not
                                justified.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>MacGuigan asked which of the three was the worst. The Secretary
                                responded that Pell had told him that the three reservations
                                represented minimum demands. He urged Canadians to use their
                                imagination in examining these questions. Assistant Secretary Vest
                                said that Washington officials as well are turning over ideas on
                                these problems. The Secretary said that we need to work together and
                                use our collective ingenuity. If we back off from this treaty, it
                                will be a long time before there is another one. Now the lines are
                                frozen. In retrospect maybe we should have had hearings earlier. The
                                Secretary said that all he could promise was that the U.S. will do
                                its best to explore possibilities for accommodation, if Canadians do
                                the same. MacGuigan asked if this could be done before the
                                    conventions.<note n="8" xml:id="d83fn8">Reference is to the

                                was not likely this year. The Secretary said that depending upon the
                                economy, there could be a post-election session of the Senate, but
                                that he did not favor waiting. MacGuigan agreed. The Secretary said
                                he thought a good two-sided presentation could be made. Now is the
                                time to float ideas. He would be in touch with MacGuigan. We have to
                                look at the committee list to see who can carry the ball, though it
                                will be pretty hard. The treaty needs a constituency.</item>

                                was no misunderstanding. MacGuigan said that subject had been

                                    telephone about a number of topics, including the U.S. embargo
                                    of grain sales to the USSR in the wake of the Soviet
                                    intervention in Afghanistan. According to Carter’s handwritten
                                    memorandum of conversation, he said: “It’s important for you to
                                    back us in grain embargo &amp; not replace grain to SU which we
                                    did not sell.” In response, Trudeau said: “We will keep our word
                                    to you.” (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Brzezinski

                                    to remove any ambiguity in Trudeau’s pledge that Canada would
                                    ‘keep its word.’ We were told that Canada had decided to hold
                                    shipments to 3.8 million tons for this crop year, the level set
                                    in February. No commitments were made for the crop year

                                MacGuigan thought that prospects were looking good. However, this
                                would depend to an extent upon the general referendum next
                                    Tuesday.<note n="10" xml:id="d83fn10">In a referendum held on

                                    negotiations over Quebec’s sovereignty and the terms of its

                                issue, although it is high profile in Quebec, is not that high
                                profile in the rest of Canada. However, Canadians expected the
                                situation to improve under Trudeau and thus an adverse vote could
                                hurt the government. Nonetheless, this is a long-range problem. The
                                referendum is just a step. We hope that this step is resolved
                                happily but in their case it will not be decisive.</item>

                                unfortunate. The Secretary said that he had been very impressed with

                            toward the USSR. The support of other exporters for an extension of the
                            grain embargo into 1980–81 is in doubt. The key to continued exporter
                            cooperation is Canada, and your personal intervention with Trudeau is
                            essential to win Canadian support for that policy. This memorandum

                        <p>At a meeting of grain exporting countries on May 20, we proposed a
                            cutback in shipments from this year’s level.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3"
                                >Telegram 9064 from Brussels, May 21, reported on the May 20 meeting
                                of agricultural officials from Canada, Australia, Argentina, the
                                European Communities, and the United States, which focused on
                                restrictions on grain sales to the Soviet Union. (National Archives,
                                RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D800250–0319)</note> Reactions
                            to our proposal were discouraging; other countries will not reduce
                            shipments. Australia and the EC have said they will not increase sales
                            in the coming year if other exporters undertake similar commitments. But
                            Canada appears unwilling to accept any limit on exports. (C)</p>
                        <p>The PRC reviewed the issue at its June 2 meeting on the allied response
                            to Afghanistan. (You saw the Summary of Conclusions.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d84fn4">See Document 54.</note>) The grain embargo is the
                            centerpiece of our post-Afghanistan measures. Thus, any move to lift
                            restraints on grain exports would be seen at home and abroad as a
                            weakening of our response to the Soviet invasion. Since the cooperative
                            effort hinges on Canadian participation, the PRC concluded that you
                            should call Trudeau urgently and ask that Canada maintain grain exports
                            to the USSR at the 1979/80 level (3.8 million metric tons). (S)</p>
                        <p>The Canadian bureaucracy is dead set against this approach and considers
                            the embargo ineffective and burdensome. Trudeau may make that point and
                            also suggest that exporter restraint will be meaningless if the Soviet
                            harvest is average. The talking points provide a fallback position:
                            indicate that we are prepared to review our policy in September when we
                            have a better estimate of the Soviet crop. This may help bring Trudeau
                            along. (See also attached forecast.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">Not

                                shipments to the USSR in 1980–81 to this year’s level, noting that
                                the EC and Australia would follow the US and Canadian lead. Trudeau
                                said that the Cabinet planned to discuss the issue on June 16 and
                                that he could probably give you a final answer at Venice, if not
                                before. On a temporary basis, he would maintain shipments at the
                                1979–80 level until December, but he could not make any commitment
                                beyond that. If the Cabinet agrees to the US request, there will be
                                no problem. If not, he would be prepared to approach the issue a
                                half-year at a time. Officials from both sides could meet to
                                consider this approach. You acknowledged that this was helpful and
                                said you would discuss it further at Venice.<note n="3"

                                    US should not try to define too closely what ‘normal’ is. May be

                                Trudeau expressed concern about Senate review of the Treaty. He said
                                we are getting close to a fish war despite Secretary Muskie’s
                                efforts. You agreed that the matter is serious and noted that Lloyd

                        <p>In June Ambassador Kenneth Curtis cabled from Ottawa his concerns over
                            the apparent downturn in US–Canadian relations.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d86fn2">Reference is to telegram 3117 from Ottawa, June 10,
                                in which Curtis wrote: “I sense that we are on the verge of a
                                downturn in U.S.-Canadian relations, certainly in the atmosphere,
                                probably in the substance, primarily as a result of growing Canadian
                                frustration over the U.S. failure to act on maritime boundary and
                                fisheries treaties.” (Ibid.)</note> He noted that Canadians felt
                            they had responded positively on global matters of vital US concern, but
                            that there had been no positive effect on bilateral relations.
                            Ambassador Curtis underscored Canada’s deep disappointment over the
                            Senate’s failure to approve the fisheries and boundary treaties, and
                            Canada’s concern over the lack of progress on other major bilateral
                                issues.<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">Telegram 3127 from Ottawa, June
                                10, reported that in the first comprehensive statement of foreign
                                policy under the Trudeau government, MacGuigan “spoke of
                                ‘inexplicable delays’ in presenting the bilateral fisheries/maritime
                                boundary treaty to the U.S. Senate, called proposed amendments
                                ‘wholly unacceptable,’ and warned that Canada would take
                                ‘appropriate steps’ to protect its competitive position if U.S.
                                fishermen continued ‘over-fishing.’” (National Archives, RG 59,

                        <p>The possible sharp downturn in relations which appeared likely in June
                            has not materialized, and over the past three months several positive
                            developments have improved the general atmosphere of US–Canadian
                            relations. The signing in a few weeks of a comprehensive tax treaty
                            should continue that process.<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">On September

                        <p>Still, Canada’s deep-seated disappointment over the fisheries treaty is
                            likely to overhang the relationship. Even a resolution of the impasse,
                            which will inevitably require some retreat by Canada, will leave
                            Canadians with a sense of injury.</p>

                        <p>On August 26 Secretary Muskie and Lloyd Cutler met with Senators Kennedy,
                            Pell, Mitchell, Tsongas, and Cohen in an effort to soften the “Kennedy
                            Amendments” which shift the balance of benefits so far toward US
                            fishermen that Canada finds them unacceptable. At Mr. Cutler’s behest
                            the Senators agreed to consult with fishing industry representatives on
                            the acceptability of less extreme amendments to the fisheries treaty.
                            When the views of the Senators and the fishing industry have been
                            received, the Department will consider further the presentation of those
                            views to Canada.<note n="5" xml:id="d86fn5">In telegram 276127 to
                                Ottawa, October 16, Pickering informed Curtis that “We have been
                                working with Senator Kennedy’s staff over the last few weeks to
                                identify mutually-acceptable amendments to the fisheries treaty
                                which we would have been willing to take to Canada. However, Senator
                                Kennedy (and Senator Pell) have not been able to resolve the issue
                                with their constituents.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign
                                Policy File, D800494–0153)</note></p>
                        <p>In press and private comments Canadians have expressed concern that if
                            the US fishing industry calls for extensive changes in the treaty,
                            Canada will be placed in the position of either backing down or bearing
                            the onus for the failure of the agreement. Canadians believe this would
                            be unfair, and such a result would surely have repercussions on other
                            aspects of our relations. Whatever the outcome, the involvement of
                            Secretary Muskie and Mr. Cutler should make it clear to the Canadian
                            Government that the US attaches top priority to achieving approval of
                            the treaties.</p>

                                Trudeau to inform him that his administration was committed to
                                completing the Alaska gas pipeline project and that the House and
                                Senate had passed a concurrent resolution with an “overwhelming
                                majority” expressing support for it. (Memorandum of conversation,

                                Material, Subject File, Box 38, Memcons: President: 7/80) On July
                                17, Carter sent Trudeau a letter to confirm U.S. support for the
                                pipeline. (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, President’s

                            Canada to authorize the export of additional gas which will allow the
                            early construction of the southern legs of the pipeline and will improve

                        <p>Progress was made on this politically volatile question through the
                            signing in August by Secretary Muskie of a Memorandum of Intent
                            committing both countries to develop a bilateral agreement on effective
                            domestic control programs. The Memorandum established a mechanism to
                            gather technical data necessary for a formal air pollution agreement.
                            The importance of the Memorandum of Intent should not be overestimated,
                            but it nonetheless makes clear that the US takes Canadian concerns
                            seriously.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tuna Embargo</p>
                        <p>Our year-long embargo on Canadian tuna exports to the US has been lifted.
                            Last year Canada seized 19 US tuna boats which were fishing off Canada
                            contrary to Canadian law. The US does not recognize the authority of
                            coastal states over albacore tuna and other highly migratory species,
                            and under the terms of US law an embargo on Canadian tuna and tuna
                            products was imposed. In an agreement reached last month Canada agreed
                            to permit US tuna fishermen to operate off British Columbia, in return
                            for limited access by Canadians to US ports. The same agreement called
                            for negotiations (which have since begun) on a treaty which would permit

                        <p>Canada has been increasingly concerned over its persistent deficit in
                            automotive trade with the US. With 1979’s deficit coming to $2.5
                            billion, Canada requested consultations on the agreement early this
                            year. Two rounds of consultations—one at the ministerial level—have been
                            held in an effort to meet Canadian concerns.</p>
                        <p>Under the economic and political climate which prevails in the US today,
                            it will be difficult to devise measures to reduce Canada’s deficit. We
                            do not plan to initiate proposals to modify the Auto Pact, although
                            Canada may do so. We are keenly interested in restoring strength to the
                            North American auto industry and are prepared to examine any Canadian
                            proposals. Our willingness to discuss these issues has demonstrated US
                            sensitivity to Canada’s problems in this area.</p>

                                in our relationship with Canada as that country struggles to achieve
                                a basic realignment of its economic and political structure. This
                                presents both risks and opportunities for us. There are a number of
                                substantive and symbolic steps that we should take in order to
                                improve our prospects for avoiding the risks and taking full
                                advantage of the opportunities to advance our interests. These range
                                from such organizational measures as reestablishing a position for a
                                Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary with no country responsibilities
                                other than Canada to such operational steps as scheduling a
                                Presidential visit to Canada early in the new administration and
                                moving promptly to resolve the Senate impasse on the East Coast
                                fisheries and boundary treaties. Our relationship with Canada is our
                                most extensive and one of our most important. We need to devote to
                                it the resources and attention which it requires and deserves. End

                                interests are occurring. We must move strongly and purposively, and
                                in a well-coordinated way, if we are to protect and advance our
                                interests effectively, avoiding the risks and taking full advantage

                            <item>The complexity, diversity, and sheer scope of our relations with
                                Canada can hardly be overstated. Our trade with Canada is nearly
                                twice that with our next largest foreign customer, Japan, and is
                                equal to our trade with all of the countries of the European
                                Community combined. Over a fifth of our foreign investment is
                                located in Canada. There are some 68 million crossings of our common
                                border by Americans and Canadians annually. Our joint agenda
                                includes a staggering array of issues from potato imports in Maine
                                to a proposed dam in Washington state and includes the major global
                                concerns such as the response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
                                and cooperation in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. It is
                                clearly the most extensive relationship we have with any country and
                                in many ways one of the most important.</item>

                                and structural adjustment toward more efficient patterns of energy
                                use will tend to be delayed.</item>

                            <item>The implications of certain NEP provisions for our trade relations
                                are also of concern. The requirements for use of Canadian goods and
                                services appear inconsistent with obligations undertaken by Canada
                                in the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The
                                implementation of Canadian content requirements in the synfuels area
                                will make it far more difficult for us to resist pressures to
                                incorporate “Buy America” provisions in our own expanding synthetic
                                fuels program.</item>

                            <item>In the investment field, the requirement that at least 50 percent
                                of oil and gas production be Canadian owned by 1990 and the
                                ownership requirements for production on the “Canada-lands” seem
                                likely to reduce the flow of investment funds into the Canadian
                                energy sector. These requirements do not appear to be in accord with
                                the national treatment provisions of the OECD Declaration on

                                        mind in framing our domestic policies and that we must use
                                        international forums to promote mutually reinforcing

                                        about Canada’s National Energy Program. We, in turn, have
                                        sought to explain the unique features of the Canadian energy
                                        situation and to demonstrate how the program is responsive
                                        to our needs. In particular, there were two meetings of the

                                            of U.S. and Canadian officials in Ottawa on November 7,
                                            Hinton “opened the discussions of Canada’s National
                                            Energy Program by expressing ‘shock and disappointment’
                                            with the philosophical and political thrust of the
                                            energy program.” Hinton also “noted that the NEP seemed
                                            to work against the collective energy needs of the
                                            industrialized world by dampening oil production
                                            potential from Canada” and “emphasized the strong
                                            negative reactions the USG was receiving from industry
                                            and investors and he expressed concern that the general
                                            effect of the NEP was to undermine the cohesiveness of
                                            the international free trade and investment system that
                                            the Western world has created over the past 30 years.”

                                        the National Energy Program reinforces our positive

                                        consistent with our international obligations. Under the
                                        program, Canada will reverse its growing dependence on
                                        imported oil and will become self-sufficient in oil by the

                                    <item>With respect to Canada’s trade policy, I would emphasize
                                        that the NEP was not designed to undermine our international
                                        agreements, and that we fully intend to honour our
                                        obligations under the GATT. As was made clear at the
                                        December 17 meeting, our concern is to ensure that Canadian
                                        firms are given an equal opportunity, no more and no less,
                                        to compete for contracts for the development of Canada’s oil
                                        and gas resources.</item>

                                    <item>You mention Canada’s obligation under the OECD Declaration
                                        on International Investment and Multilateral Enterprises.
                                        While Canada is fully supportive of the principle of
                                        national treatment, as a general rule, our commitment to it
                                        is not an unqualified one. We consider the energy sector to
                                        be of special and vital importance to Canada, as it is,
                                        indeed, for all industrialized countries. We have
                                        consistently maintained that the degree of foreign ownership
                                        and control of the Canadian petroleum sector was unique in
                                        the Western world and could not be allowed to continue
                                        indefinitely. It was for these reasons that Canada signed
                                        the OECD declaration with the proviso that “Canada will
                                        continue to retain its right to take measures, affecting
                                        foreign investors, which we believe are necessary given our
                                        particular circumstances.” Oil and gas lands development was
                                        singled out as a case in point.</item>

                        <p>A disagreement between the Department of Defense on one side and State,
                            CIA and the Justice Department on the other has resulted in “suspension”
                            of important electronic surveillance activities conducted by the Army’s
                            Special Operations Field Office (SOFO) in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Since 1947 SOFO has conducted wiretaps [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                            behalf of U.S. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            intelligence, security and criminal investigation purposes. The Army,
                            however, has long been anxious to drop these activities which it feels
                            are outside its traditional role. The State Department and CIA have
                            argued that SOFO activities are essential to meet U.S.
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>The Ford Administration commissioned a study of the problem by a special

                            President Ford decided to keep SOFO in operation and had my predecessor
                            issue a directive which included Justice Department approved measures
                            intended to assure protection of the rights of U.S. citizens (Tab

                            General Levi later reversed his position and raised serious legal

                            the special interagency study group to review the problem again. (Tab

                            and his personal concern about political sensitivity. Secretary Brown
                            believes that, if SOFO is to continue at all, it should be on the basis
                            of (a) a personally signed Presidential Directive and (b) an Attorney
                            General approval attesting to its legality. He also believes that SOFO
                            presents a danger of scandal akin to that following the Army’s domestic
                            surveillance of civilians in the 1960’s and, even if existing legal
                            doubts could be resolved, the risks, when weighed against “marginal
                            benefits” are high. The new interagency study (Tab F)<note n="8"

                                which included representatives of the Department of Defense, the
                                Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency.” (Carter

                                PD–09 [1])</note> concludes that you should issue a new Presidential
                            Directive. The Attorney General has personally reviewed the recommended
                            draft Directive and associated procedures and believes they “are lawful,
                            and electronic surveillance [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] conducted or requested by the Department of Army
                            in Berlin pursuant to the Directive and procedures would likewise be
                            lawful.” (Tab G).<note n="9" xml:id="d90fn9">Tab G, a letter from Bell

                        <p>The political sensitivity and risk factor is less clear than the legal
                            issue. It is hard, however, to understand Secretary Brown’s fear of
                            “scandal” and embarrassment to you <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the
                            operation is legal and it can be demonstrated that prudent steps have
                            been taken to protect the rights of U.S. persons. Unlike most
                            surveillance situations, the local authorities [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>] in Berlin are aware of it and
                            desire to see it continue. Moreover, Berlin is particularly vulnerable
                            to terrorism, espionage, sabotage or substantial public disorder which
                            could directly affect our position in the city and which can be directed
                            against both military and civilian components of the U.S. military
                            forces. Discontinuation of our monitoring activities would make more
                            difficult the tasks of all Allied and German agencies charged with
                            security and law enforcement functions in Berlin and could even result
                            in a loss of confidence about American determination to discharge our
                            responsibility in Berlin. U.S. access to other forms of intelligence
                            information generated by our Allies could be limited and there could
                            well be a reduction in intelligence cooperation with West German
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>On balance, I believe that this is one of those situations where you must
                            take a certain amount of limited political risk to ensure that larger
                            U.S. interests are served.</p>
                        <p>The remaining question is whether SOFO should continue to do the
                            monitoring or, as Secretary Brown recommends, it should be taken over by
                            a non-Defense agency. CIA is the only alternative, and it lacks the
                            legal authority. The Army, as the occupying authority in the U.S.
                            sector, has the necessary powers and responsibility.</p>

                                    concerned over the proliferation of reprocessing capabilities.

                                    diminish the danger of particular agreements being abrogated,
                                    and we ourselves are prepared to do more than we have in the

                                    Germany thought less money than provided in the consortium might

                                    effective program to monitor NATO air space. He emphasized how
                                    far the United States had gone in keeping AWACS alive so it
                                    might be a NATO program. He suggested, frankly, that it should
                                    be considered on its merits by the Federal Republic, not
                                    combined with negotiation of tanks. He cited recent difficulties
                                    with joint tank programs and indicated that we want to live up

                                        suggested that the FRG further postpone its long-delayed

                                    willingness to abide by multilateral restraints. He stressed his

                            the agreement—the transfer of blueprints or the actual transfer of
                            hardware which would occur only several years hence. Secretary Vance
                            indicated that any transfer at this sensitive time would be counter
                            productive, but the Foreign Minister asked the United States to look
                            into the question again. He noted that Germany can be more flexible if
                            it is not perceived to be under United States pressure. The Vice
                            President suggested that it might be possible to transfer only
                            blueprints for non-sensitive aspects of facilities.</p>
                        <p>The President said that to the extent transfer of blueprints can be
                            delayed, that would be a great help. We will make special efforts to
                            indicate that we trust Brazil and regard non-proliferation as a
                            worldwide problem. We do not distrust any nation, but we do not want to
                            add another country to the list of those that can explode bombs.</p>

                            The problem about the FRG–Brazil deal was difficult enough, but if this
                            were the only outstanding issue it would not be so bad. However, there
                            has been a cumulation of things which are clouding the relationship and
                            which disturbed him greatly. As examples, he mentioned: <list>

                                    is getting entirely too much public advice and pressure from US
                                    Administration officials concerning what he should do about the
                                    FRG’s economy. While economic policy matters are legitimate
                                    subjects for confidential talks at the Summit or directly
                                    between government leaders, he strongly resents the amount of
                                    public comment in the US regarding the FRG situation. The FRG,
                                    after all, is a big economy which, all things considered, is not
                                    doing so badly, and which has been helpful to its neighbors and
                                    other countries. He is firmly opposed to moves toward
                                    “reflation” and the US should understand this.</item>

                        <p>Schmidt said these points were illustrative only and he could cite
                            others. He was prepared to believe that many of the current problems
                            resulted from a new administration in Washington and that, by the end of
                            the year, things hopefully will have settled down. However, he is
                            concerned by the psychological damage which could be done in the
                            meantime in terms of the attitude of people in the FRG toward the US and
                            the alliance.</p>
                        <p>At times pounding the table and speaking in loud tones, Schmidt said he
                            had to tell me that in all the 12 years he had been in high office in
                            the FRG he had never been so irritated and concerned as he is now about
                            relations with the US.</p>
                        <p>He stressed that his own inclinations and those of all leading political
                            figures in the FRG are favorable to working with the US. Also, he
                            considers that the alliance between the US and the FRG is and must
                            continue to be the central, vital element of FRG foreign policy. Given
                            developments in the last few months, however (and here he had in mind US
                            attitudes on the Brazil deal and nuclear energy questions in general as
                            well as the points made above), Schmidt said he could only hope that the
                            US Government shared this dedication to our relationship.</p>

                            as well as exposing the city to terrorist activities and Communist
                            penetration. High level U.K. officials have also expressed their deep
                            concern.</p>
                        <p>My own view remains that SOFO should be continued under the
                            responsibility of the U.S. Army. It is hard to understand Secretary
                            Brown’s concerns if, as the Attorney General testifies, SOFO’s
                            activities are legal and it can be demonstrated that appropriate steps
                            have been taken to protect the rights of U.S. persons. Berlin is
                            unusually vulnerable to terrorism, espionage, sabotage or substantial
                            public disorder which could directly affect our position in the city and
                            which can be directed against both military and civilian components of
                            U.S. military forces. Discontinuance of SOFO operations would also make
                            more difficult the tasks of all Allied and West German agencies charged
                            with security and law enforcement functions in Berlin and could well
                            result in a loss of confidence about American determination to discharge
                            the broader responsibilities for Berlin which we have assumed since the
                            end of World War II. In short, the need is clear and specific.</p>

                            on it next week, and wanted to give you prior notice. Do you have a few
                            minutes to talk about it?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> Yes.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Secretary Vance gave you the key
                            elements of it, and we welcome your comments on it, and whether anything
                            in it causes you concern.</p>
                        <p>(Reading): “Many countries see nuclear power as the only real
                            opportunity, at least in this century, to reduce the dependence of their
                            economic well-being on foreign oil . . . the U.S. has a major domestic
                            energy source—coal.” But even here “our plans also call for the use of
                            nuclear power as a share in our energy production.”</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> May I insert something here, and
                            say that we fully share this point.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> The second point: There is a
                            problem of unrestricted use, particularly if it leads to atomic
                            explosives. We have said to the American people that we have the
                            Non-Proliferation Treaty, which has been signed by more than 100
                            nations. But we need to go farther. There are real risks of development
                            of nuclear weapons or explosive capabilities.</p>
                        <p>“These risks would be vastly increased by the further spread of sensitive
                            technologies. . . . We are now completing an extremely thorough review .
                            . .” This includes “the serious consequences of proliferation and direct
                            implications for peace and security—as well as scientific and economic
                            evidence . . .”</p>
                        <p>I should say that we have had this done with 20 of our most distinguished
                            nuclear physicists. Dr. Schlesinger has been working on it for 6 to 8
                            weeks, and I have put in a lot of my time. I have some technical
                            background, though I am no expert.</p>
                        <p>We have concluded that we need to make “a major change in U.S. domestic
                            nuclear energy policies and programs; and a concerted effort among all
                            nations to find better answers to the problems and risks accompanying
                            the increased use of nuclear power.”</p>
                        <p>Today, I wanted to say that I will be announcing next week some points on
                            what we will do, and I had better read this verbatim.</p>
                        <p>“First, we will defer indefinitely the commercial reprocessing and
                            recycling of the plutonium produced in the U.S. nuclear power programs.”
                            We are deferring the Barnwell project, even though it has cost many
                            hundreds of millions of dollars.<note n="4" xml:id="d95fn4">Reference is
                                to the nuclear fuel plant located at Barnwell, South
                                Carolina.</note></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> Do you wish me to comment
                            here?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Yes sir.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> If this is a statement of new U.S.
                            policies, then we would have no complaint. But if it is structured as an
                            example for others to follow, then we would have something to complain
                            about.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I understand.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> If a country has enough natural
                            uranium, like the United States, then this approach is all right. But if
                            a country does not have natural uranium—like Germany—then it depends on
                            imports as much as it does on oil. There is great pressure to reprocess.
                            Also, in countries without great areas of land, then it is necessary to
                            reduce the waste storage problem through reprocessing. This is not a
                            problem for a large country like the United States. But for smaller
                            countries, with dense population, it is, and there is dependence on
                            uranium imports. Therefore, problems have a different shape.</p>
                        <p>It would be helpful if you would say that your stand is as an American
                            for the United States, not necessarily an example to be imposed (sic) on
                            others. We will cooperate closely and willingly on reports and analyses
                            for an international regime for the uranium cycle.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I take your point, we have no
                            disagreement. There will be two phases. The first will be strictly
                            domestic. And in the second we will pursue close mutual and
                            international discussions to try to circumvent the problem, and I’m sure
                            there won’t be one. We will try something on providing storage under
                            international control. And we will try something to assure supplies of
                            natural uranium and deuterium and enriched uranium for countries that
                            have a supply shortage. We will keep trying to reduce problems and not
                            go forward on the international side until after consultations. There
                            will be no pressure. Is this fair?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> Yes. Let me say something in four
                            sentences. I was given your preliminary outline of the statement on

                            the expense). For example, if you are interested in a particular part of
                            it, then we would reduce our effort.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> (Reading). “<hi rend="italic"
                                >Fourth,</hi> we will increase U.S. production capacity for enriched
                            uranium to provide adequate and timely supply of nuclear fuels for
                            domestic and foreign needs.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Fifth</hi>, we will take the necessary legislative

                            guarantee delivery of such nuclear fuel to other countries.” We will
                            remove the prohibition here.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Sixth,</hi> we will continue to embargo the export of

                            policy before, and it will continue.</p>

                            achieve their energy objectives while reducing the spread of nuclear
                            weapons. Among other things, we will explore the establishment of an
                            international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation program aimed at developing
                            alternative fuel cycles and a variety of international and U.S. measures
                            to assure access by all nations to nuclear fuel supplies and spent fuel

                            proposing. There is room for amending what I said to Mr. Vance. Let me
                            mention two points.</p>

                            with Secretary Vance: if at the same time that the U.S. puts its policy
                            out, wouldn’t it be wise to have in parallel a joint statement by our
                            two administrations on our willingness to cooperate, and to enhance
                            non-proliferation policies, generally. Perhaps we should be more
                            specific. This is something to be wished and desired, and may be even
                            necessary for public use.</p>

                            aspects, such as the agreement with Brazil, are not expressed in the
                            paper. But we can have a long talk when you will be here (in Europe).
                            These issues need not hamper our joint statement on our joint approach
                            (to international aspects of nuclear policy), if you wish to do

                            it be passed along. Schmidt had asked to see him, and appeared to have
                            prepared his comments. Before London, Schmidt had been concerned about
                            some of the President’s attitudes and policies, but felt reassured by
                            the meetings there. On the basis of these talks, he had been in touch
                            with the East Germans, Tito, and Brezhnev, and indicated that Carter had
                            made his point on human rights, and that in future he would not place so
                            much emphasis on the subject.<note n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">In the margin
                                next to this sentence, Carter wrote: “Schmidt is mistaken.”</note>
                            But the overblown campaign had continued—including the most recent
                            magazine editors interview—and “made a liar” out of Schmidt.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d96fn5">Reference is to Carter’s May 20 interview; see

                        <p> Schmidt had seen in detente an opportunity to get 200,000 ethnic Germans
                            out of Eastern Europe. This had been proceeding nicely, but was
                            threatened by the President’s approach. He felt he had made this clear
                            to the President in London, and been understood. Now, however, he felt
                            he had been “misled”. The President also does not seem to understand
                            what is happening in the Soviet Union. Brezhnev cannot easily continue
                            his support for detente, and the President’s approach to human
                            rights—the continued pressing—is making Brezhnev’s position more
                            difficult, and thus is posing risks for the West.</p>
                        <p>Reston said he emphasized that Carter had stressed the importance of
                            working closely with the Allies. Schmidt said that he had heard that,
                            too, but the effect of the President’s actions (as on the human rights
                            campaign) was directly the opposite. If he is President for 8 years, he
                            will never have more sympathetic leaders than himself, Giscard and
                            Callaghan, but doesn’t seem to understand their needs. Schmidt also
                            stressed the risks in leftward movement in France and Italy—including
                            fears of U.S. troop withdrawals, forced by Congress, if Communists come
                            to power (or at least a very unwelcome dramatization of the
                            Bonn–Washington axis). Plus there are grave dangers in Begin’s
                                election.<note n="6" xml:id="d96fn6">On May 17, the Likud Party won

                            Schmidt also repeated his theme about the need for parity in SALT to be
                            balanced with parity in conventional forces (MBFR), where he feels U.S.
                            policy is not on track.<note n="7" xml:id="d96fn7">In this sentence,
                                Carter underlined the words: “he feels US policy is not on track.”
                                In the adjacent margin, he wrote: “We talked freely for hours. He’s
                                apparently changed his ideas and concerns J.”</note></p>
                        <p>Reston said that if Schmidt felt so much concern about the President’s
                            policies, he should be in direct contact. (Schmidt seemed to be trying
                            to give the impression that he also spoke for Giscard and Callaghan, but
                            Reston dismisses the validity of this idea). Schmidt said he was
                            worried—based on what he had been told—that the President would react
                            too strongly to a letter or phone call, so had kept silent.</p>
                        <p>Reston said he had professional doubts about passing all this on, but
                            felt he should, in view of the depth of Schmidt’s feelings, and his
                            reluctance to make those feelings known.</p>
                        <p>The above is hinted at in Reston’s NYT piece of June 16.<note n="8"

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Political Context</p>
                        <p>The current discord in relations with Bonn reflects various anxieties on
                            Schmidt’s part.</p>
                        <p>First of all, <hi rend="italic">his own political future is extremely
                                clouded</hi>. It is an open secret in Germany that his coalition
                            partner, the Free Democrats under Vice Chancellor Genscher, are building
                            bridges to the opposition, and keeping open the possibility of forming a
                            new coalition government with the Christian Democrats next spring or
                            summer. Elections in two German states next year (Hesse and Lower
                            Saxony) could be decisive.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt’s political demise is not inevitable. The opposition is not
                            united and is led by a colorless figure (Helmut Kohl). Yet <hi
                                rend="italic">Schmidt needs some dramatic initiative to regain his
                                former popularity</hi>. Since his domestic policies are constrained
                            by the conservatism of Genscher’s party, his only field for showing
                            movement is foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>The European Community, despite its fundamental importance, is dull and
                            uninteresting to the German public. <hi rend="italic">What catches the
                                imagination, and appeals to deep-seated fears, is Eastern
                                policy</hi>—relations with the Soviets and with East Germany.
                            Moreover, the pressures in his own party—especially from the Brandt
                            group—point him toward the East to show that he is in fact easing the
                            division of Germany and shoring up Germany’s security by keeping the
                            line open to Moscow. <hi rend="italic">That is why he is deeply upset by
                                our human rights policy and the uncertain prospects for U.S.–Soviet
                                relations if there is no SALT agreement</hi>. He knows that he
                            cannot conduct an independent Eastern policy in opposition to the United
                            States (at least not for very long). But it will be political disaster
                            if he is to endure a period of rising tensions out of loyalty to the
                            United States. This would almost guarantee the return to power of the
                            Christian Democrats.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Second, his political future is likely to be affected
                                by events in France and Italy.</hi> There is a growing concern in
                            Germany that the Federal Republic will become an “island in a Red Sea.”
                            Schmidt personally is appalled by Mitterand’s common front with the
                            Communists. And the German Social Democrats, including many former
                            Communists, have fundamental concerns about the rise of “Eurocommunism,”
                            and the trend toward coalitions with them. If the Left wins in France,
                            the probable reaction will be a shift to the Right in Germany, virtually
                            sealing Schmidt’s doom and beginning to divide the European great
                                powers.<note n="7" xml:id="d97fn7">In this sentence, Carter
                                underlined the words: “Left wins in France” and “virtually sealing
                                Schmidt’s doom.”</note> All Europeans recognize, however, that
                            Europe cannot be constructed without a fundamental Franco–German
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Third, Schmidt prides himself on being the most
                                knowledgeable European leader in economics. He resents U.S.
                                advice</hi> and bristles at U.S. pressures on his economic policies.
                            For Schmidt and for most Germans, high unemployment and spiraling
                            inflation raise the spectre of social unrest and political
                            radicalization, in a country whose history cannot permit either
                            phenomenon.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Finally, there is the specific question of the
                                Brazilian nuclear arrangement and its feedback into German
                                politics.</hi> For Schmidt, fulfilling his contractual obligations
                            is a matter of German “honor,” especially so with all the Third World
                            watching. He argues that Germany of all countries cannot earn a
                            reputation for reneging on international commitments. Nor can Germany
                            any longer afford to repudiate an agreement that encounters American
                            disapproval. <hi rend="italic">What is frustrating for the Germans is
                                that they basically share your non-proliferation goals, but for the
                                foregoing reasons, feel that the Brazilian deal</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">allows for little compromise</hi>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt has been complaining about this
                                Administration’s policies in recent weeks to almost anyone who will
                                listen</hi>—to Reston, to his own press and to his EC
                                colleagues.<note n="8" xml:id="d97fn8">For Schmidt’s remarks to
                                Reston, see Document 163. Telegram 519 from Luxembourg reported
                                Thorn’s account of critical comments made by Schmidt at the June
                                29–30 European Council meeting in London: “Thorn said that he
                                ‘couldn’t believe his ears’ when he heard Schmidt; the Chancellor
                                had said that President Carter appeared to be accommodating and
                                flexible but was really determined on getting his way and that
                                American policy was as domineering as it had ever been in the past.
                                Thorn said that he thought that the nuclear non-proliferation
                                question was the root cause of Schmidt’s bitterness.” (National

                            pique of a temperamental—even slightly paranoid—man at having been
                            supplanted by you as the West’s most attractive leader. Another part is
                            sheer frustration occasioned by his own political situation. Yet<hi
                                rend="italic">, from his perspective, none of our policy initiatives
                                has helped him politically, and most have hurt.</hi> Urging him to
                            reflate the economy played to the inflation phobia. He may regard our
                            non-proliferation policy as likely to cost him employment; he may see
                            arms transfer restraint in a similar light. And our activism on human
                            rights has trapped him between the worry that Germany’s success in
                            getting (in many cases, buying) ethnic Germans out of Eastern Europe
                            will be jeopardized, on the one hand, and the taunts of his right-wing
                            opposition that he is soft on human rights, on the other.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt finds himself in the position where the U.S. can decisively
                            influence his political future. Under the traditional conditions that
                            have governed German–American relations, he should want this visit to

                                circumstances, it is also not necessarily a disadvantage to stand up

                        <p>After opening pleasantries, <hi rend="italic">the President</hi>
                            suggested that the meeting be devoted to East–West issues, with economic
                            questions and perhaps MBFR discussed the next day. He indicated that he
                            or Vance would be happy to brief the Germans on the Middle East.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> then reviewed various East–West
                            issues:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">SALT</p>
                        <p>The United States wants to strengthen its relations with the Soviet
                            Union. At the same time, it wants to deal with East–West issues that
                            have been postponed—for instance the U.S. seeks not just to ratify
                            higher limits on nuclear weapons but to freeze and then begin to reduce
                            those levels. The President said he would provide details on SALT. The
                            U.S. presented two options: (1) ratifying the Vladivostok formula, or
                            (2) moving directly to SALT 3 by reducing overall levels to 1800 and
                            MIRV totals to 1100, by constraining heavy missiles and cruise missiles
                            and by imposing a total freeze on new weapons. So far, the United States
                            had not been successful, but Vance would meet with Gromyko in
                            September.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comprehensive Test Ban</p>
                        <p>Progress on CTB had been better. The U.S. is prepared to stop all testing
                            of nuclear devices, even so-called peaceful nuclear explosions (pne’s).
                            The Soviet Union is reluctant to forego pne’s, but the U.S. had been
                            generally pleased with the Soviet response. The U.S. is prepared to let
                            France and China remain outside the test ban, though with the hope that
                            they will eventually join. The Soviets had at first insisted that China
                            must be a party, but later dropped that insistence. They want a treaty
                            for 18 months, the U.S. desires a longer period.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Indian Ocean</p>
                        <p>The United States wants to freeze military activity in the Indian Ocean,
                            make provision for prior notification of movements in the area and then
                            begin reductions. The small nations in the region do not want to see
                            great power activity increased, and the Soviets have responded to U.S.
                            initiatives.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Arms Control Issues</p>
                        <p>The United States has also proposed treaties banning chemical and
                            radiological warfare; those appear to have good prospects. The U.S. has
                            proposed that both sides give prior notification of missile tests.
                            Soviet–American study groups are looking at all the questions the
                            President mentioned. The U.S. is also concerned about anti-satellite
                            capabilities and has proposed a ban on such systems. The Soviets are
                            testing them, and the U.S. feels that is dangerous. <hi rend="italic"
                                >The Chancellor</hi> asked if the Soviet Union has an edge in
                            anti-satellite capabilities. <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>
                            responded that the Soviets have conducted seven tests, with two
                            successes. The U.S. is discussing ways to limit those systems; given the
                            role of satellites in monitoring arms control, the issue is clearly
                            important.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> noted that the U.S. and the Soviet
                            Union had renewed treaties for cooperation in space. Kirillin was in
                            Washington the week before to discuss cooperation in science and
                            technology, and the U.S. airlifted a large experimental magnet to the
                            Soviet Union as part of that cooperation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Attitude Toward the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The last and most difficult area, <hi rend="italic">the President</hi>
                            indicated, is the Soviet comprehension of U.S. attitudes. The U.S. wants
                            peace and a diminution of tensions. The Soviets are concerned—as the
                            Chancellor had indicated—about human rights. The President believed the
                            U.S. and German positions at Belgrade are compatible; the U.S. has no
                            desire for polemics. <hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> asked if the
                            President agreed that Western cooperation with the Soviets at Belgrade
                            had been good. <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> did agree, and Vance
                            called the latest proposal by the non-aligned nations a good one.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that Brezhnev had emphasized
                            the negative, not the positive. When Vance met Gromyko, there was
                            progress. But then Brezhnev or Gromyko would decry the lack of progress
                            and suggest that the U.S. wanted a return to the Cold War. It is hard to
                            know Brezhnev’s motives. The Soviets had had some success in the
                            media—perhaps even with the Chancellor—in arguing that the U.S. did not
                            want progress. The President had asked Brezhnev for his proposals, had
                            offered to meet in Washington or in Alaska, but there was no response.
                            The President stressed his desire to meet with Brezhnev and to convince
                            him of the U.S. good faith.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, the President said, the U.S. has met with reasonable
                            success in its dealings with Moscow. Moving into new areas was bound to
                            be hard—and the U.S. had proposed, simultaneously, reductions on
                            missiles and on deployments in the Indian Ocean, a ban on anti-satellite
                            capabilities, and prior notification of missile tests. Yet the President
                            remained hopeful. He felt that the Soviet Union has economic problems,
                            and has made no progress in relations with China. Stability in Eastern
                            Europe remains adequate from the Soviet point of view—although the
                            President said he would defer to the Chancellor’s judgment on that
                            point. The President indicated that the U.S. wants to treat all three
                            baskets at Belgrade, not bias the conference towards one. The U.S. wants
                            progress, not embarrassment for any nation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Schmidt’s View of Brezhnev</p>
                        <p>After thanking the President for his presentation, <hi rend="italic">the
                                Chancellor</hi> presented his view of Brezhnev’s position. He said
                            it was important to remember that Brezhnev is not as powerful,
                            institutionally, as an American President or even as a German
                            chancellor. “Showing off” in Eastern Europe may be in part a
                            compensation for Brezhnev’s “lack of sovereign power of decision” in
                            most areas. He is dependent on others, especially now that his health is
                            failing. There is no decision he can take by himself. He of course has
                            great influence; he can sum up meetings and issues for decision, but he
                            must use “tricks” to make his desires prevail in the Politburo.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, Brezhnev, <hi rend="italic">the Chancellor</hi>
                            suggested, is perhaps the most forthcoming of the Soviet elite; Tito had
                            told the Chancellor that Brezhnev was “obsessed” with detente. Some of
                            that same feeling had run through the Chancellor’s conversations with
                            Kadar of Hungary, though Kadar was cautious and most of what he said was
                            between the lines (what he actually said could have been read in Moscow
                            without harm to Kadar). The moderates in Eastern Europe—Gierek, Kadar,
                            Tito—are all genuinely concerned about a return to the Cold War.</p>

                            Brezhnev tried to make up his mind what it meant, others in the elite
                            were spreading a hard line on it. Giving Brezhnev forty-eight hours of
                            warning would have been useful.</p>

                            uncertainty; he believed that since Czechoslovakia Brezhnev had given
                            Eastern Europe some breathing room. Brezhnev has three abiding motives.
                            The first is his obsessions with China; the second is his preoccupation
                            with structural economic difficulties. But the third is his belief that
                            detente is his life task.</p>

                            Perhaps we have moved too fast in too many areas; the Soviet government
                            is old and cautious. We will try to reassure them in every way we can;
                            we will not respond to expressions of animosity on their part. In
                            private, except for SALT, progress has been encouraging. We would like
                            to bring them into Middle Eastern discussions; none of the parties want
                            them deeply engaged at present, but we keep them informed. The Soviets
                            have an inclination to deal bilaterally, while the President said he
                            preferred multilateral discussions. The Soviets have responded slowly
                            when we have talked with them about, for instance, non-proliferation or

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said there is a glimmer of hope that
                            progress might be made this year. The U.S. was surprised by Begin’s
                            election and by some of his initial statements. Since then he has
                            sounded more moderate—saying he is prepared to go to Geneva without
                            condition, that everything is negotiable—although in private he has
                            continued to refer to the West Bank as liberated, not occupied. The
                            President said he had held good talks with Hussein, Asad and Sadat; he
                            had outlined the three-point American framework to them all. He felt
                            that none of the Arabs except perhaps the Saudis wanted an independent
                            Palestine; all feared Soviet influence in such a state and preferred
                            some form of federation with Jordan. A settlement will be hard for both
                            sides: Israel will have to withdraw and the Arabs will have to accept
                            normal trade and diplomatic relations with Israel. But the existing
                            situation is a terrible drain on them all. We will not impose terms; at
                            present the Arabs are more eager for a specific U.S. proposal than are

                            trying. Ninety percent of the ship construction is being done in Japan.
                            That is difficult for the Chancellor, as he is from a shipbuilding

                        <p>C: Helmut Schmidt.</p>
                        <p>P: This is Jimmy Carter. I called to express our concern and attention to
                            the problem of the terrorists you now confront.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d99fn2">Reference to the September 5 kidnapping of

                                of Employers.</note> We are fully supportive of your efforts.</p>
                        <p>C: Thanks. I can use that support at this time.</p>
                        <p>P: Remember that you can count on us. I will also remember you in my
                            prayers. We all hope this can be settled without further bloodshed. What
                            are the prospects?</p>
                        <p>C: They are unclear. We are in indirect contact with the kidnappers
                            through Switzerland. We are trying to bargain for time. I assume we are
                            talking privately, without anyone listening in. I can tell you on that
                            basis that we won’t surrender.</p>
                        <p>P: That seems to me a proper course of action.</p>
                        <p>C: It is our decision. We have, of course, left the situation
                            intentionally unclear.</p>
                        <p>P: How are the rest of the things going? I understand you put before the
                            Bundestag a program of tax reduction. And perhaps also an increase in
                            public spending?</p>
                        <p>C: It also included an expansion of public expenditures for capital
                            investment. It is hard to convince the states and communities to do
                            projects. They have the major part of such expenditures, the federal
                            government only the minor part.</p>
                        <p>P: I thought you just had to issue a directive and that was that.</p>
                        <p>C: I thought that was true for you! (Laughter)</p>
                        <p>P: How are your spirits?</p>
                        <p>C: Very good. I had always prepared to live up to challenges.</p>
                        <p>P: You have my complete support. Prime Minister Barre is here and he says
                            to tell you the same is true of him.</p>
                        <p>C: Thank you. Please give him my regards and express to him my gratitude.

                            its advantages. We don’t want to go ahead and then face public criticism

                            he said that not one, but several countries might raise problems.</p>
                        <p>P: It’s good to have that information.</p>

                                    he perceived as American efforts to have the FRG do more to
                                    stimulate its economy.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central

                        <p>Begin summary. Schmidt received me at my request for one hour’s
                            conversation January 23. He thought many good things had happened in
                            U.S.–FRG relations, noting in particular that tensions and emotions
                            about nuclear energy questions which had characterized early months of
                            1977 had dissipated. However, while not wanting to appear to complain or
                            be the “difficult German” he wished to use our conversation to express
                            his concerns on several matters of interest. He stressed his comments
                            should be held in strictest confidence and that they were intended for
                            the President. On economic matters and the dollar, he expressed himself
                            along familiar lines as reflected most recently in his speech to
                            Bundestag January 19. U.S. actions to support dollar have been welcomed,
                            but he thought more needed to be done; he suggested consideration might
                            be given to gold sales. On SALT, he also expressed familiar concerns
                            regarding a developing imbalance in sub-strategic weaponry, noting
                            proposed limitations on cruise missiles while Soviets proceed with
                            SS–20, Backfire and conventional build-up. On neutron weapon, he hoped
                            President would take decision on production without linking it to
                            deployment so that weapon could be used as bargaining tool. He felt it
                            was unwise to expect Europeans—and especially FRG (a non-nuclear
                            power)—in effect to decide on production and introduction of nuclear
                            weapon. If it becomes necessary to deploy neutron weapon, then President
                            could rely on him. Schmidt also commented briefly on Middle East, Horn
                            of Africa, Turkey and Brezhnev’s health. He welcomed Secretary’s trip to
                            Turkey and prospect of resumption of U.S. aid.<note n="3"

                            Soviets may have some success in drawing Turkey away from Alliance.
                            Schmidt said he anticipates with much pleasure the President’s visit and
                            economic summit meeting in Bonn during second half of July and he sent
                            warmest wishes to President. End summary.</p>

                                    informed Stoessel that the FRG Ministry of the Interior would
                                    issue a press release regarding the accidental reentry of the
                                    Cosmos 954, a Soviet satellite that carried a small nuclear
                                    reactor. Van Well also stated “that current Foreign Office
                                    thinking is to hold bilateral discussions with the US, the UK
                                    and France regarding the proper international venue for
                                    examination of this matter. He indicated that the FRG may also

                                commented that many good things had taken place in U.S.–FRG
                                relations during past year. In particular, he noted that emotions
                                and tensions of early 1977 relating to questions of peaceful use of
                                nuclear energy seemed to have been dissipated. <lb/> When I remarked
                                that we still had some concerns in this field, Schmidt acknowledged
                                that this was so and said that this was entirely normal. Countries
                                have different interests and he had the feeling that these
                                differences were now recognized. However, he was pleased that we
                                were now able to discuss them in a rational and constructive way. He
                                mentioned that he had been somewhat puzzled by news accounts he had
                                seen about the release of the guidelines on export of nuclear
                                material developed by the London Group, since some reports indicated
                                the guidelines and the release had been entirely a U.S. initiative.
                                I said this had not been intended by the U.S. and that if there was
                                any impression in this direction it undoubtedly resulted from
                                misinterpretation by the media.</item>

                            <item>Schmidt said he wished to utilize the rest of our time to express
                                his views on several matters of importance and concern to him. He
                                stressed that his comments should be held extremely closely and that
                                they were intended for the President. As he had said, there was much
                                that was positive in U.S.–FRG relations, and he did not want to
                                appear overly critical or as the “difficult German,” but he thought
                                it might be useful to speak frankly on certain subjects. He
                                emphasized his entire devotion to the U.S.–FRG relationship, which
                                he considers is the absolute fundamental of the security of the
                                Western world, and he felt that this relationship was such that
                                frankness in discussion should not be misinterpreted.</item>

                            <item>On economic matters, Schmidt began by summarizing remarks he had
                                made in his government declaration January 19 (Reftel) in which he
                                had said that the stimulation program undertaken by the FRG
                                represented the limit of what could be expected. As in his
                                declaration, he was critical of several articles appearing recently
                                in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> which implied that the
                                FRG should do more in the direction of acting as a locomotive for
                                Western recovery.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Expanding on these themes, Schmidt said that the public deficit in
                                the FRG amounts to some 4 percent, which is the highest since
                                Hitler’s time, with the possible exception of 1975. He fears that
                                there is inflationary potential building up which could be dangerous
                                for the future. In his efforts to enlarge the money supply, he is
                                dependent on the cooperation of the Bundesbank to issue sufficient
                                money and on private banks to enlarge their credits. If the
                                Bundesbank were to decide that the public deficit was too high, it
                                could squeeze the money supply, with the result that there would be
                                higher interest rates, with a corresponding slow-down in investment.
                                He emphasized the independence of the Bundesbank and its dislike of
                                the current, extremely low interest rates; Schmidt noted that he and
                                others in the government had been compelled to exert great effort to
                                persuade the Bundesbank to agree to reduce the short-term interest
                                rate last November. Schmidt said he thought the U.S. should
                                understand this background and the sensitivity of his position. He
                                recalled that Erhard had been toppled in 1966, in large part because
                                of the opposition of the Bundesbank to his policies—he did not want
                                to be in the same position.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Speaking about the fragility of the overall world economic
                                situation, Schmidt said that he thought the present uncertainty and
                                “turmoil” resulted mainly from inflation caused by the enormous
                                amount of dollars circulating throughout the world. He thought this
                                situation could be traced back to the Vietnam war and, overall, that
                                this was more important than the excess of dollars caused by U.S.
                                imports of oil at high prices. Schmidt said that U.S. dollars were
                                pouring into the rest of the world and that in 1977 the
                                industrialized countries had bought up some $38 billion. He doubted
                                if this rate would continue in 1978; if this were the case, there
                                could be a further decline in the value of the dollar. Also, it was
                                possible if not certain that oil prices would go up later this year
                                and that the OPEC might decide to base their sales on a mix of
                                currencies. Also, OPEC might put its surpluses in other currencies,
                                such as the Deutsche Mark or the pound rather than in dollars. This
                                also could affect the dollar adversely. The Chancellor stressed that
                                these things would not necessarily take place, but he was worried
                                about the prospects.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Schmidt was pleased with the steps which have been taken by the
                                U.S. to strengthen the dollar. These, together with the energy bill
                                if it is passed (I said we were optimistic about passage in the near
                                future) would all be of help, but the Chancellor did not feel that
                                they went far enough. Especially in the event that pressures develop
                                as he had already outlined, he thought considerably more would be
                                necessary, such as some sale of gold by the U.S. or borrowing from
                                the IMF. Schmidt emphasized that, in his thinking, he was not
                                motivated primarily by concern regarding FRG exports to the dollar
                                area, but rather by his general worry about the state of the world
                                economy.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The Chancellor next turned to the SALT negotiations and other
                                security matters. As he understood it, the U.S. and the Soviets were
                                making progress toward an agreement which would stabilize their
                                strategic nuclear arms to an extent which would more or less
                                approach parity. However, he was concerned about the “sub-strategic”
                                nuclear level, noting that the Soviet Union apparently will be left
                                free to continue with its production of modern medium-range MIRV’d
                                missiles and that production of the Backfire bomber would also
                                continue in substantial amounts. These were weapons which posed a
                                direct threat to Western Europe, although it appears that the U.S.
                                has already agreed to put a severe limit on ground-based cruise
                                missiles in the European area and also would agree to limit the
                                transfer of technology about the cruise missiles to its allies. The
                                Chancellor saw the Soviet threat against Western Europe, the Middle
                                East and Scandinavia as growing, while Western military assets would
                                be declining. He was also worried about the growing disequilibrium
                                in conventional forces between East and West. As he understood it,
                                the situation at present was manageable, but could become more
                                disadvantageous in the future for the West. Realistically, he did
                                not know where further conventional forces could come from on the
                                Western side, and he stressed that no FRG political leader could
                                increase the present German conventional contribution over present
                                levels.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>I noted that some of the weapons systems the Chancellor had
                                mentioned, such as the Soviet SS–20, could be the subject of
                                follow-on negotiations to a SALT II agreement. Moreover, I pointed
                                out that the limitation on ground-based cruise missiles in Europe as
                                presently envisaged would be for a three-year period and that no
                                options were foreclosed thereafter. So far as transfer of technology
                                was concerned, we had discussed only a non-circumvention clause with
                                the Soviets in connection with SALT II and it was not my impression
                                that we intended to limit technological information to our Allies.
                                The Chancellor said he was glad I had mentioned these points and he
                                acknowledged that it was entirely possible that he did not have all
                                of the relevant information concerning the status of the
                                negotiations. However, his concerns were in the direction he had
                                indicated. So far as the three-year protocol was concerned, he
                                personally felt it was probably unrealistic to expect that, after
                                banning deployment of cruise missiles in Europe with the range of
                                600 kilometers, we could reverse this position and deploy
                                longer-range missiles. The political pressures against such a move,
                                especially in an election year in the U.S., would be too great, in
                                his view.</item>

                            <item>On the enhanced radiation weapon, the Chancellor said that the
                                present situation is equivalent to asking the European countries to
                                decide on the production of this weapon. This poses particular
                                difficulties for the FRG, which, by international agreement, is not
                                a nuclear power. The Chancellor suggested that it would be
                                preferable, if the President intends to use the enhanced radiation
                                weapon as a bargaining factor in arms control negotiations, for him
                                to take the decision to produce the weapon in the U.S. If
                                negotiation does not bring a satisfactory result and if other
                                circumstances combine to indicate that the enhanced radiation weapon
                                should be deployed, then, the Chancellor said, the President could
                                rely on him. When I noted that our position has been that a
                                production decision could not be separated from the decision to
                                deploy, since the weapon could only be used in the European area,
                                Schmidt said he personally did not feel this argument necessarily
                                was valid. He recalled that, in the past, the U.S. had decided to
                                produce weapons even though deployment in the European theatre was
                                not assured, and he mentioned ADM’s and certain types of missiles in
                                this connection.</item>

                            <item>Speaking briefly about the Middle East negotiations, Schmidt
                                implied strong criticism of Begin’s stand in the negotiations. If
                                another war results from Begin’s intransigence, Israel should be
                                made to understand that there would be very little moral or
                                substantial assistance forthcoming from the Western countries in
                                support of Israel. He thought the U.S. was in the best position to
                                make this clear to Begin.</item>

                            <item>With regard to the situation in the Horn of Africa, Schmidt said
                                he would simply express a general concern that, perhaps as a result
                                of the Vietnam experience, the U.S. seemed to be overly reluctant to
                                exert its influence in this key strategic area. At the same time,
                                the Soviets appeared to be moving massively, together with the
                                Cubans, and Ethiopia was beginning to resemble another
                                Angola.</item>

                            <item>Schmidt said he was concerned about the situation in Turkey, where
                                the Turks seem to be increasingly divorced from the Alliance and
                                more and more subject to Soviet pressures. He thought it was good
                                that the Secretary had gone to Turkey and he hoped the U.S.
                                administration would be successful in reestablishing military aid
                                for Turkey. He acknowledged the importance of some Turkish movement
                                on Cyprus, but expressed doubts that Ecevit would be able to prevail
                                against the military in bringing this about.</item>

                                Brezhnev visit sometime in the future, the Chancellor said only that
                                he has the impression that Brezhnev is “really sick” and that there
                                is a period of great uncertainty at present within the Soviet
                                leadership. He feels that the dominant thought in the Kremlin at
                                present is about “when” Brezhnev will leave the scene and not
                                “if.”</item>

                                the economic summit. He asked that I convey his best and warmest

                                with more specific information and details concerning suggested
                                dates and planning for the bilateral visit as well as the

                            <item>Comment: The Chancellor seemed vigorous and in good form, as he
                                has on several recent occasions when I have seen him. His concerns
                                on economic questions, SALT and his position on the enhanced
                                radiation weapon come as no surprise and are consistent with what we
                                have heard and reported previously on these subjects. His overall
                                attitude toward the U.S. seemed upbeat and, as he stressed himself,
                                his concerns as expressed to me should not be taken as detracting
                                from his positive approach overall. It is evident that he values his
                                relationship with the President, looks forward to the opportunity of
                                seeing him several times this year, and that he wished to use the
                                occasion of our talk to pass on views to the President in a spirit
                                of frankness and openness.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi> replied that, in terms of the
                            domestic situation, there are two complexes of different factors. On the
                            one hand, there is, stronger than before, the problem of labor disputes,
                            since they have about 1 million people out of work. But on the other
                            hand, the economic situation is going up. In the last quarter of 1977,
                            they had a real increase in growth of 6%, calculated on the
                            “Anglo–American” yardstick. This was an enormous upswing, though he
                            could not say whether it would endure into the first quarter of 1978.
                            But the domestic outlook is fine. The foreign outlook, however, is not
                            as good, especially with exchange rates and currency. (<hi rend="italic"

                                his Hamburg speech was a demonstration of appreciation for his
                                remarks as well as an indication of our interest in keeping things
                                on an even keel.<note n="5" xml:id="d102fn5">See Document

                                meeting with German journalists and that he, too, would take a very
                                positive line on our relations. Secretary Blumenthal was also
                                pleased with recent contacts with his German counterparts and
                                believed that we were now more in harmony on economic positions. I
                                said we appreciated Genscher’s own efforts (the <hi rend="italic"

                                to put a better perspective on our relations. In sum, I said I

                            <item>Genscher agreed completely with this positive evaluation of our
                                relationship. He termed our ties a “vital element” of German foreign
                                policy and said he would continue to work hard to insure that this
                                was reflected in the press. Genscher thought the Warsaw Pact states
                                and particularly Moscow had contributed to the negative press
                                commentary on our relations. He cited Communist efforts to split the
                                Alliance on the ERW issue in this regard.</item>

                            <item>Genscher said German leaders had read with great interest and
                                satisfaction President Carter’s Wake Forest address. He spoke warmly
                                of the sections on defense policy noting that he and his colleagues
                                were particularly pleased with the President’s emphasis on
                                maintaining our military strength and on the US engagement in
                                Europe. They also welcomed his remarks on flexible response and on
                                the NATO long-term program to develop conventional strength. No less
                                important was the determination expressed by the President to oppose
                                Soviet-sponsored insurgency in the third world. Genscher said the
                                West must make clear to Moscow that we have global responsibilities
                                and a global policy. The Soviets must be made aware that their
                                actions in one area of the world will have an effect on their
                                overall relationship with the West. We cannot be indifferent to what
                                happens in the Middle East or Africa since events there affect NATO
                                security as a whole.</item>

                            <item>Genscher said our economic differences had been vastly overdrawn
                                in the press. Both he and Economics Minister Lambsdorff had been
                                pleased to read the remarks of Fed Chairman Miller on anti-inflation
                                policy. They felt his statement meshed well with FRG strategy in
                                this area. In addition, Genscher and Lambsdorff had the impression
                                that Secretary Blumenthal’s recent statements on inflation were also
                                in relative harmony with German positions and this was a very
                                positive development.<note n="6" xml:id="d102fn6">On March 14,

                            <item>Genscher referred several times to the great importance he
                                attached to an increase in parliamentary exchange visits between the
                                US and Germany. He believed the present level of contact was
                                insufficient, particularly among the younger parliamentarians. It
                                was also necessary to broaden the base of parliamentary contacts.
                                Genscher felt, for example, that contacts were fairly strong in the
                                defense area, but that this was not the case in the economic and
                                foreign policy spheres. Genscher had spoken recently to Bundestag
                                President Carstens about the latter’s discussions in the US and they
                                were in complete agreement on the need to increase parliamentary
                                exchanges.</item>

                            <item>At the close of our discussion, Genscher suggested that the
                                Foreign Office issue a press release noting that we had met in a
                                particularly warm atmosphere and that our discussion had reflected
                                the high degree of consensus that exists between the US and FRG. A
                                statement to that effect was put out this morning.</item>

                            Chancellor Schmidt took the ERW message relatively calmly. He was at
                            pains to point out the steps taken by FRG to enable us to carry out an
                            anticipated positive decision on production. Yet, given President’s
                            strong inclination, he now appears prepared to help us implement a
                            negative decision. He will face sizable domestic political problems with
                            the anticipated decision, and urges that we schedule NAC and US
                            announcement after Genscher’s visit to US next Tuesday or

                                views along same lines as my presentation yesterday to

                                ponder the message I brought, he would have only questions and
                                “provisional” remarks. On the substance of the decision, he would
                                not question the President’s judgment, for the decision was his
                                alone to take. He will call a Federal Security Council meeting

                                and Genscher will bring their more matured reaction on modalities
                                when he comes to Washington next Tuesday or Wednesday. He asked that
                                any announcement be delayed until after Genscher’s visit so that he
                                could have an opportunity to comment on the text.</item>

                            <item>Schmidt then commenced a review of the US–FRG consultation prior
                                to March 20. He wanted to be certain that the President was fully
                                conscious that the FRG had totally agreed with the US on substance
                                and procedures prior to March 20, and had worked hard to persuade
                                others in Germany and elsewhere of the validity of our three-step
                                approach, including ultimate ERW deployment on FRG soil. He could
                                not hide his astonishment at the turn of events that had occasioned
                                my trip. But he did not labor the point unduly, and the moment
                                passed.</item>

                            <item>Referring to my remarks about potential divisiveness in the
                                Alliance, he asked which countries had reservations about a decision
                                to produce. When I mentioned Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, and
                                Belgium, he was surprised about Belgium. When he specifically asked,
                                I said we did not put Germany among that group. On my point of a
                                wide division of public opinion in NATO countries, I said in
                                response to his question that there was such a division in the US.
                                As for Germany, he said some may welcome a negative decision, but
                                not the majority.</item>

                            <item>Schmidt then diverted to a statement on the dangers of SALT for
                                the security of Europe, especially the limitations in the protocol
                                on cruise missiles and the potential of the Backfire bomber. Because
                                he believes the Soviets are getting an edge in theater and strategic
                                weapons, he had welcomed the attempt to use the ERW as a bargaining
                                chip against the SS–20, or preferably, the Soviets’ tanks. But it
                                was not to be, and he accepts the President’s probable
                                decision.</item>

                            <item>When I asked his advice on whether a negative ERW decision could
                                be used not as a specific bargaining chip but as a general factor to
                                influence Soviet behavior, Schmidt answered with a question: what

                                ploy, and enable US to focus on their true arms control stance, but
                                thought this would be a fleeting advantage.</item>

                            <item>These points now off his chest, Schmidt turned to the question of
                                how best to handle the decision, making the following points: (A)
                                the decision is and should be presented as a sovereign decision
                                taken by the President; (B) it would be unwise to allow concern
                                about potential divisiveness in the Alliance over a positive
                                decision to flow into the announcement; (C) he is doubtful that
                                there should be any reference in the announcement to a divided
                                public opinion; (D) there should be a NAC meeting just before the
                                announcement, though he accepts the desirability of prior
                                telegraphic notification to NATO capitals.</item>

                            <item>He strongly urges that announcement be delayed until Genscher can
                                come to Washington to consult with US on the announcement. He will
                                try to advance Genscher’s departure so he can arrive late Tuesday.
                                His emphasis on this point indicates that he wants Genscher’s
                                physical as well as intellectual involvement.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> Helmut Schmidt speaking.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi>: This is Jimmy Carter. Did you have
                            a good visit with Brezhnev?<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">Reference is to
                                Brezhnev’s May 4–7 visit to the Federal Republic of

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> That is exactly why I
                            called.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> It is gracious of you to call. Are
                            you pleased with the visit?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> Yes. They were kind and
                            helpful. They tried to play down the conflicts that of course continue
                            to exist. One point, Jimmy, I wanted to report to you immediately. In
                            our personal conversation, without aides present, Brezhnev inquired a
                            lot about you. I said I am totally convinced of your peaceful
                            intentions. Not only did I have the impression that he wanted to meet
                            you, but I said that I thought you wanted to meet with him. I said there
                            was no doubt about your desire to conclude the SALT II negotiations. He
                            asked a lot about that. He sometimes tried to project the impression
                            that he was not convinced of your seriousness, but seemed mostly
                            acting.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I see.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> I said that you faced some
                            opposition in the Senate to a SALT Agreement, and that, as far as I
                            could see from Europe, that opposition would increase because of Soviet
                            activities in Angola, Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I think that is an accurate
                            assessment. I want to conclude an agreement, and I am prepared for a
                            fight after we get an agreement. I believe the American people will
                            support an agreement, and the prospects for ratification are very good.
                            I don’t fear a fight. What you told him is accurate; as I’ve told him in
                            correspondence, when the Soviets interfere in Africa, either through
                            their own actions or those of the Cubans, there is a sense here that the
                            Soviet Union is not sincere about detente or SALT. We’ve been sinful in
                            the past ourselves, in Vietnam, so the Soviet activities in Africa are
                            very disturbing to the American people. What you said is accurate.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> I said
                            that very strongly.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> How vigorous was Brezhnev? How was
                            his health?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> I’ve known him now for five
                            years. Without any doubt he is not in the same shape as he was in 1973
                            or 1974. He reads his papers, and he wants to have Gromyko or a personal
                            aide with him all the time. Still, he seems to have an overall grasp of
                            the problems. His personal and moral authority with his ministers and
                            with the Politboro seemed quite strong. It was obvious that he is
                            getting old; he needs an aide de camp and a doctor, that sort of
                            thing.</p>
                        <p>His attitude was benign, friendly. I think his belief in the necessity of
                            overall peace throughout the globe has to be taken seriously. I take his
                            comments to that effect at face value, though clearly there are others
                            back in Moscow, who we don’t see.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> As a measure of his commitment to
                            detente, did you make any progress in MBFR?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> We did talk about it. I showed
                            him charts about the Soviet tank superiority in Central Europe. He
                            didn’t want to talk about the subject, but he listened, and he took the
                            charts with him. We also discussed those weapons that are covered in
                            neither the MBFR nor the SALT talks. He said the Soviet Union was
                            willing to negotiate about those systems. That was new for me, a new
                            willingness of the Soviets to include those weapons not covered in
                            either existing negotiation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I have two more questions. Did you
                            have the impression that he is genuinely interested in concluding a SALT
                            II Agreement and, second, in accepting our long-standing invitation to
                            visit the United States?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> I think he is deeply
                            interested in SALT II. As a personal matter, I think he also deeply
                            wants to meet with you. I have the impression that his aides say now is
                            not the time for a visit but that he should wait and see if SALT II
                            progresses near a conclusion.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We’re eager for progress. Gromyko
                            will be here in two weeks. The last time I met with him we made more
                            progress in three hours than the negotiators make in months. I found
                            Gromyko insightful and apparently with authority to make some moves
                            forward. He was not familiar with all the details—those are hard for me
                            or for anyone else. I look forward to his visit, and I think we can make
                            progress.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> Gromyko is coming to the U.S.
                            at the end of the month, is he not? He was very friendly on this visit.
                            He even laughed about twice a day! (laughter) Brezhnev does want to meet
                            you, Jimmy.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> We have the
                            same impression. I offered to meet with him at Camp David or in Alaska
                            or somewhere else. We share your assessment: those around him don’t want
                            him to come until they are sure about SALT.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> Yes, from his political
                            position, that makes sense.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We have done nothing to delay. The
                            Panama Canal treaties had to be brought to a vote first, but nothing
                            else holds up SALT. We have never held back in the negotiations. We can
                            see what the negotiators can accomplish before Gromyko comes. I hope
                            that after I meet with Gromyko and we make more progress, Brezhnev will
                            see that with one face-to-face meeting we can finish an agreement. I
                            would then plan on not presenting the agreement to the Congress until
                            1979. Congress got far behind during the debate on the Panama Canal
                            treaties and couldn’t handle both SALT and the rest of the business it
                            must do this year. But that need not delay signing an agreement.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> That is what I told Brezhnev.
                            I said the negotiations could conclude but then you might not present
                            the agreement to Congress until next year.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> There is the Limited Test Ban,
                            which has been in effect for years even though Congress has never even
                            considered it. So an agreement I sign with another leader can be binding
                            even without formal Congressional approval.</p>
                        <p>Let me raise another subject. Do you have any reticence about making a
                            strong public commitment to NATO when you come to Washington, or do you
                            have any reticence about the long-term defense measures that have been
                            developed?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> Not at all. I received your
                            telegram yesterday.<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">On May 5, Carter sent
                                messages to Callaghan, Giscard, Schmidt, and Trudeau that invited
                                them to a May 30 lunch for those heads of state and government who
                                would attend the NATO summit and proposed a draft of a statement to
                                be issued on May 30 by the heads of delegation. (Telegram 116402 to
                                Paris, London, Bonn, and USNATO, May 8; National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D780194–1031)</note></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We have been somewhat concerned.
                            Pierre Trudeau seems to want to hold back on the long-term defense
                            program; I’m not sure why. He doesn’t want to move forward in one step.
                            But I feel the world needs a display of confidence by the NATO Allies.
                            Congress will give very strong support—it has been reluctant sometimes
                            in the past.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt:</hi> I read the draft statement
                            that you sent me. I would suggest that one point be elaborated, the
                            point about our desire to secure arms control agreements that enhance
                            security. I’d like that to be given more plausibility. We have the
                            Special Session in New York in the same week as the NATO meeting, and we
                            need some common denominator for the two. Perhaps that could be “balance
                            of military capabilities,” which could be achieved either by reducing
                            arms or, if necessary, by improving our defenses.</p>
                        <p>But I have no reluctance about the statement. I think it is good for us
                            to issue as NATO members. I also agree with the idea of holding a
                            private informal luncheon outside the NATO context. We can talk freely,
                            and it should be interesting for us and for the other heads of
                            government. I buy both ideas, but I suggest we try to give more
                            substance to the arms control part of the statement.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I’m very encouraged. Anything you
                            want to do to strengthen the statement is amenable to my desires.
                            Perhaps you could also send your comments to the other heads of
                            state.</p>

                                memorandum to Carter, July 12, in which Owen noted that Carter and
                                Schmidt agreed on MTN, suggested that Carter “should ask what
                                Schmidt’s intentions are on growth, and press him for specifics” and
                                proposed that on energy “[w]e can pledge both where we will be by
                                1985 and that we will have the measures in place by this year’s end
                                for getting there.” Owen also wrote that “Hiss tells me that Schmidt
                                considers US nuclear fuel supply assurances as important as energy
                                assurances—implying that this, too, will affect the scale of any
                                German growth decision” and that this “could be a bargaining chip of
                                considerable importance; if Schmidt doesn’t raise it, you should.”

                                this were trading weapons in a SALT bargaining process; but there

                        <p>Schmidt’s visit to Washington in May has gone a long way to reducing the
                            concerns he has expressed within days or weeks of every other meeting
                            with you.<note n="6" xml:id="d106fn6">See <ref target="#d101fn10"

                            also helped to clear the air on his central concern about our Soviet
                            policy, which has been the focus of his doubts about US leadership.<note

                        <p>Since you met with Schmidt on May 30, the setbacks to the FDP in the
                            Hamburg and Lower Saxony elections (eliminating the FDP from those state
                            parliaments) have placed the Coalition in a more precarious position.
                            For Schmidt, therefore, it is even more important to demonstrate that he
                            can get along with the dominant power in the Alliance, <hi rend="italic"

                            necessarily the same thing, especially on the issue of German economic
                            growth. Also, he now has a greater stake in a successful Summit. And the
                            visit to Hesse (Frankfurt) is particularly important because of the
                            state elections there this fall.<note n="8" xml:id="d106fn8">On July 15,

                        <p>Based on your meeting with Schmidt in May, you will have the best sense
                            of the way to pick up in your talks in Bonn. There are two key areas:
                            resolving any remaining Summit issues, and continuing discussions on
                            East–West relations. (If we have not resolved the problem of the Dole
                            Amendment by the time you go to Germany, Schmidt is likely to focus in
                            his bilateral with you on our ability to deliver our part of the Summit
                            “package.”) You may want to report on the Vice President’s visit to the
                            Middle East, review Cy’s talks with Gromyko, and discuss African
                            developments—including Schmidt’s trip to Africa.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">East–West Relations</p>
                        <p>Schmidt still is skeptical about U.S. steadiness, sense of purpose, and
                            leadership in East–West relations. You might begin by reviewing the
                            themes in the Annapolis speech and developments since then, including
                            our African views.</p>
                        <p>On arms control, four central themes in Schmidt’s approach stand out,
                            reflecting psychological attitudes that go beyond the specific issues: <list>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">SALT</hi> is most important for him. On <hi
                                rend="italic">SALT II</hi>, he is interested in timing, chances for
                            ratification, a possible Brezhnev visit, keeping open cruise missile
                            options, and non-circumvention. On <hi rend="italic">SALT III</hi>, he
                            is concerned about our overall method of approach, and about gray area
                                systems.<note n="9" xml:id="d106fn9">See footnote 3, Document
                                12.</note></p>
                        <p>At the moment, gray area systems are the chief focus for doubts about our
                            reliability. Yet although he proposed gray areas negotiations to
                            Brezhnev, it is not clear that he has completely thought through either
                            force posture or arms control implications. He is also aware that the
                            French and British have deep reservations about gray area arms
                            control.</p>
                        <p>Your approach should be to meet his psychological needs: reassuring him
                            about our nuclear commitment (no “decoupling”) and about the <hi

                                    control possibilities firmly in the context of force planning.
                                    We believe it would be unwise to commit the Alliance to
                                    negotiations in advance of that review.</item>

                        <p>Schmidt’s approach to <hi rend="italic">MBFR</hi> reflects the same
                            overall attitudes towards arms control, plus a desire to focus attention
                            on the specific German security situation. Thus he is ambivalent about
                            MBFR, and is unclear about where he wants it to go: on the one hand, he
                            wants the talks to move forward; but on the other he does not want a
                            situation where Germany is singled out for individual force limitations,
                            outside of a wider Alliance framework.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Germans have been <hi rend="italic">less</hi> positive than we
                            have been on the recent Warsaw Pact response to the West’s MBFR
                            initiative. They are concerned about 1) the discrepancy in Warsaw Pact
                            data, and 2) the national force constraints in the Pact response. You
                            can reassure Schmidt that we will continue to work closely with him on
                            the NATO response, and that we do not believe we are now on the
                            defensive.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the Germans are <hi rend="italic">more</hi> positive
                            about Giscard’s proposal for a disarmament conference, although it would
                            clearly undercut MBFR. It interests the Germans because it would broaden
                            the area of force reductions, including both France and the Western
                            regions of the Soviet Union.</p>

                            would do so at some future point only in close consultation with the

                        <p><hi rend="italic">German Arms Sales to the PRC</hi>. Schmidt may ask
                            about our attitudes toward West German arms sales to China, although the
                            Germans have so far not made any commitments. The Chinese have indicated
                            particular interest in anti-tank missiles which are co-produced by
                            France and West Germany.</p>
                        <p>Our position is that we will not sell arms to the PRC or the USSR. We are
                            concerned with maintaining the integrity of the COCOM system, and are
                            concerned that the introduction of certain kinds of weaponry might be
                            destabilizing in East Asia—particularly with regard to Taiwan’s future
                            security. Nonetheless, we are not opposed in principle to all such
                            sales. Each country must decide for itself. We hope that Bonn will
                            remain in touch with us on this issue.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> I’d like to inform you: we just
                            concluded the meeting of the so-called Eurocouncil—the nine heads of
                            state of the European Community. With regard to the preparations for the

                        <p>We did reach agreement on one item, about which I wanted to give you
                            immediate notice. It’s something you discussed with Valery Giscard
                            d’Estaing, and we also discussed it at our breakfast at the NATO Summit.
                            I’ll send you a telegram tonight with the full text.<note n="2"

                            the headline would be that we agreed to consider a broad scheme for

                            stability throughout the world. We have asked the competent bodies of
                            the EC to prepare, by October 31, a plan for how such a scheme might
                            function. That with a view toward enabling the member governments to
                            reach a final decision at the meeting on December 4.</p>
                        <p>I’d like to add that I’m confident that greater cooperation in Europe
                            won’t fail to contribute to greater monetary stability between the

                            clear that those two countries will remain uncommitted until the 5th or
                            6th of December. In order to respect their position, their desire to see
                            the full scheme before deciding, the other nations did not commit
                            themselves today either. Final decisions and commitments will be made

                        <p>The President briefly reviewed some of the points discussed between
                            himself and the Chancellor in their private meeting.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d108fn2">Carter met with Schmidt in the Chancellor’s office
                                from 10:32 a.m. to 12:05 p.m. (Carter Library, President’s Daily
                                Diary) No memorandum of conversation for the meeting was found. For
                                an account based on Schmidt’s comments to an aide, see AAPBD 1978,
                                Document 223.</note> He said it had been agreed that broader
                            international support should be sought for a Rhodesian settlement. The
                            President had stressed to the Chancellor his hope that the FRG could be
                            helpful with regard to ameliorating the differences between Greece and
                            Turkey. In connection with arms control matters, gray area systems had
                            been discussed and there would be further consultations on that question
                            with the FRG and the UK. On MBFR, there were problems concerning the
                            data base as well as the question of national ceilings.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thought the Soviets were stuck with the fact that they
                            earlier had introduced false data about their forces and he wondered how
                            we could get them off this position. Chancellor Schmidt recalled that
                            former Defense Minister Leber had said that, to some degree, the
                            differences in Eastern and Western data stemmed from the fact that in
                            the West we use more civilians for certain tasks than is the case in the
                            Warsaw Pact where some tasks are performed by soldiers, whereas we would
                            have civilians doing such work.</p>
                        <p>Genscher said this was one element in the picture. A second element was
                            that the Soviets have a special program with regard to the Poles.
                            Thirdly, there was the question of what would happen to FRG troops
                            subject to reduction. The FRG would prefer to redeploy them, but the
                            Soviets seemed to think in terms of disarming and disbanding them.</p>
                        <p>The President said the Soviets seemed to acknowledge in fact that they
                            have a superiority in troop numbers, since their latest proposal calls
                            for a two-to-one reduction in Soviet forces. He thought we should
                            attempt to define more precisely what is a soldier. The Chancellor noted
                            that this might open the way to a compromise, and Dr. Brzezinski
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired about the timing of the Western response to the
                            Soviet proposal. The Chancellor suggested that the US and the FRG should
                            get together at the working level to work out a position; thereafter,
                            there could be discussion with the interested allies, followed by
                            presentation of an agreed position to the Eastern representatives. He
                            thought that the work about “defining a soldier” could be done this
                            summer.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor thought that it would be well if we adopted the position
                            that some progress is being made in MBFR. The Secretary said he had
                            already taken this position, as had the President.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that he also thought it would be a good idea to
                            introduce into MBFR the question of legalizing the declarations of
                            intent concerning Confidence Building Measures so as to make them
                            obligatory. The President agreed this would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>The President, referring to French proposals in the arms control field,
                            said we had earlier had the impression that the Chancellor favored these
                            proposals, but it had become clear in their private conversation that
                            this was not the case. It had been agreed that it would be a mistake to
                            move away from the present framework of MBFR. The FRG position had
                            assuaged our concern.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said the FRG would always be nice to the French in public,
                            but there is a basic difference between the FRG and France concerning
                            MBFR. The French seemed to want to put MBFR into a lesser category,
                            probably because they do not want to have French forces singled out. The
                            FRG has a similar concern, but perhaps French motivations go beyond
                            this. The Chancellor was not sure.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that the FRG did not want a situation created where,
                            say in 1990, the FRG could be singled out for pressure with regard to
                            its military forces. The Chancellor agreed with the President’s remark
                            that progress in MBFR on a basis of commonality would not be
                            harmful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the Soviets use words like parity and common
                            ceiling but he wondered if their meaning was the same as when we used
                            such words. The Chancellor noted that similar words had been used in the
                            Communique following Brezhnev’s visit to the FRG. The Chancellor feels
                            that Brezhnev personally is in favor of SALT negotiations and MBFR.
                            However, the situation will be more doubtful after Brezhnev leaves the
                            scene. Therefore, we don’t have too many years in which to work for an
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the subject of energy, the Chancellor said he wished to inform
                            the President that at Bremen the Nine had decided to reduce their
                            dependency on foreign energy imports by fifty percent. This is an
                            ambitious goal.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Secretary to remind him to talk later about the
                            question of the FRG and missiles in Zaire. The Chancellor noted that he
                            had been concerned by Ambassador Young’s remarks on this subject.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">In a July 12 interview with <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Le Matin de Paris</hi>, Young was quoted as saying: “Well,
                                while the presence of East Germans in Africa is limited, their role
                                is increasing. There are not many troops but a substantial number of
                                technical advisors. And the East Germans actually train and arm the
                                Africans in situations such as this one. And there they had a good
                                reason. They were worried by the missile development program set
                                afoot by the West Germans in Shaba.” (Telegram 179529 to Jidda, July
                                15; National Archives, Central Foreign Policy File, D780291–0287) On
                                July 13, the Department of State’s acting spokesman stated that
                                “Ambassador Young’s interview and his remarks relating to French
                                policy in Africa do not reflect the policies or judgments of this
                                administration and must be considered an expression of his personal
                                views.” (Telegram 80068 to Paris, July 13; National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D780287–1052)</note> Actually, his
                            reaction was somewhat ambivalent: he was embarrassed by what Ambassador
                            Young had said, but at the same time he is also embarrassed by the
                            operations of OTRAG. However, the FRG Government cannot do much about
                            OTRAG; they are not operating in the military field and the technology
                            they use is too simple to be applied for military use.</p>
                        <p>On Africa, the Chancellor said he had discussed with the President the
                            idea that all efforts should be made by Western Foreign Ministers to act
                            on an agreed basis concerning African problems such as Rhodesia, Zambia,
                            etc. In Rhodesia, he thought the situation was very dangerous and that a
                            civil war might break out soon.</p>
                        <p>The President said we have received indications from some African leaders
                            as well as from Castro that, once South African troops are removed from
                            Namibia, then the Cubans would be able to withdraw from Angola. In any
                            case, the Soviets and the Cubans are less likely to move aggressively if
                            we in the West act together.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thought there were three factors which could affect the
                            Cubans and encourage a withdrawal: (1) Namibia and the withdrawal of
                            South African troops, (2) establishment of a neutral zone on the border
                            between Angola and Zaire, and (3) an accommodation between Neto and
                            Savimbi. Also, it would help if we can encourage the Portuguese to be
                            more interested in returning to Angola. Angola seems to want them back
                            again and this would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that Brazil might also be of help in this connection.
                            They speak the same language and are pleased that they have diplomatic
                            contact with Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that food aid, perhaps from both the US and the FRG,
                            to Angola would be helpful in view of the severe drought there. Medical
                            aid would also be of assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that he hoped some special attention could be given
                            to Zambia, a country which is benevolent, democratic and well-motivated.
                            It feels surrounded and has difficulty getting its copper out for
                            export. The FRG will step up its aid for Zambia and he had asked the EC
                            to include copper in the Lome Stabilization Agreement. This could help
                            Zambia as well as Zaire. The Chancellor said he did not much like the
                            idea of a worldwide copper support scheme, since this could bring
                            benefits to the big countries such as the US and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the President, Secretary Vance spoke about the current
                            situation in the Middle East negotiations. The Secretary said we have
                            now received a plan from each of the two sides: these deal with the West
                            Bank and Gaza as well as the Declaration of Principles.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that we are hung up on the West Bank and Gaza. However, there
                            appear to be some common elements in the positions of the two parties.
                            Each provides for a transition period of five years; each provides for
                            detailed security arrangements for Israel; each states the importance of
                            true peace. The big difference is about what happens after five years
                            and what role will be provided for the Palestinians.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we hope to get the two parties into a dialogue, asking
                            direct questions of each other, etc. Nothing startling is to be expected
                            from the London meeting but perhaps we can get a process started. It is
                            also planned that there will be subsequent meetings after the initial
                            conference in London, probably alternating sites in the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that we had felt the statement issued by Kreisky
                            and Brandt about the Middle East had been helpful. We have refrained
                            from making statements in public, since this would only help Begin in
                            strengthening his already tough position.</p>
                        <p>The President said that many members of the Israeli Cabinet want to move
                            farther and faster than Begin. Among these are Weizman, Dayan and
                            Ehrlich. The Secretary noted that the latter is perhaps the most
                            important member of the Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor referred to the recent visit to Bonn of Saudi Crown Prince
                            Fahd. Fahd is deeply concerned about the Middle East and he had
                            requested that the summit meeting issue a statement on the subject.
                            However, the Chancellor doubted if this would be useful at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Schmidt said that Fahd stressed in particular his concern
                            about developments in the Horn and about Begin’s policies. Fahd sees a
                            situation where the Soviets are increasing their strength in South Yemen
                            and in Ethiopia with a view to regaining a foothold in the Middle East.
                            Begin’s delays and intransigence help the Soviets in this regard.</p>
                        <p>The President said we have been discouraged by the slowness of Begin.
                            Sadat wants to move more quickly. So far as a statement is concerned, it
                            would probably be better for individual states to make comments rather
                            than to have a joint declaration.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the people of Israel want a peace settlement.
                            Also, the United States would be prepared to give additional assurances
                            to Israel concerning security. Egypt also is prepared to see Israeli
                            security protected. This could be done by various means, such as through
                            mechanical devices, UN troops, etc. However, Begin is absolutely adamant
                            about any withdrawal from territory. This opinion is not shared by many
                            people in his party.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Begin thinks in terms of history and philosophy.
                            It should be possible to demonstrate to him that there are other ways of
                            guaranteeing security and borders. So far as security is concerned, he
                            should take a look at Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it is difficult for Begin to agree to withdrawal
                            because of the strength of his religious convictions. The Chancellor
                            commented that the only way out seemed to be for Begin to give up his
                            position as Prime Minister. The President said that, if it looked as if
                            Begin would be overridden in the Cabinet, then he <hi rend="italic"
                                >might</hi> compromise.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another subject, Schmidt inquired as to US views regarding oil
                            reserves in the Soviet Union. Crown Prince Fahd had said that in the
                            80’s the Soviets will be more dependent on the Middle East for oil.</p>
                        <p>The President thought that, if one considers the Soviet Union alone, then
                            it could probably get along on its own oil supplies. However, if it is
                            expected to supply other countries, such as those in Eastern Europe,
                            then it would have difficulties. Also, the President noted that Soviet
                            oil supplies are such that special equipment in terms of pumps are
                            required in order to extract the oil.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Brzezinski noted that the Soviet Union has large oil reserves but
                            they are in areas where extraction will be very expensive. They also
                            have enormous gas reserves.</p>
                        <p>The President then spoke of the enhanced radiation weapon. He thought
                            that it would be useful to talk at the Four Power breakfast about this
                            question in order to get the views of the others.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d108fn4">Reference is to the July 17 four-power breakfast,
                                which took place at Chancellor Schmidt’s residence from 8:44 to
                                10:17 a.m. (Carter Library, President’s Daily Diary) No memorandum

                            worried about cruise missiles, particularly if, in the future, Germany
                            is the only country in Europe on whose territory cruise missiles are
                            deployed.</p>
                        <p>The President said he has decisions coming up about the Lance missile and
                            the 8-inch shell with regard to modifying them for the ERW.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d108fn5">On October 18, the White House announced that
                                Carter had ordered the production of some components of ERW for
                                8-inch howitzers and Lance missiles. (Walter Pincus, “Carter Keeps

                            like the views of the others.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Brzezinski said that Giscard would not wish to discuss these matters.
                            However, the President felt that France will have to make a decision in
                            the future about its own position concerning ERW and cruise missiles. He
                            said there was nothing in the SALT Treaty about cruise missiles—they are
                            treated only in the Protocol.</p>
                        <p>The President said that cruise missiles in the future will constitute a
                            formidable threat to the Soviet Union and will shift attention away from
                            ICBM’s. Nevertheless, the SS–20 is already an escalation. The President
                            repeated that he would like to get the views of the others before making
                            his decisions.</p>
                        <p>Speaking about the problems of Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Secretary
                            said they were delicate and serious. No one knows just what is happening
                            in Afghanistan. Under Secretary Newsom is visiting there now and we will
                            share the results of his trip with the FRG.<note n="6" xml:id="d108fn6"
                                >Telegram 191772 to Bonn, July 28, reported that on July 26, Newsom
                                briefed Von Staden on his Asian trip. (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D780311–1317)</note> So far as Pakistan
                            is concerned, it is unclear what will happen there in the future and the
                            prospects are shaky.</p>
                        <p>The President said we are prohibited by law from giving aid to Pakistan
                            if they have a nuclear reprocessing plant. The Chancellor commented that
                            Giscard had told him France would not go ahead with the contract to
                            supply such a plant. The President said Giscard also had told him that,
                            but he always seems to postpone telling this clearly to the
                            Pakistanis.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor commented that he had reason to believe that Giscard will
                            refrain from delivering the reprocessing plant. He recalled the joint
                            statement he had made with Giscard some time ago against export in the
                            future of sensitive technologies. The Chancellor’s agreement had been
                            based on Giscard’s assurances that the deal with Pakistan would not go
                            through. The President observed that it seems clear Giscard would like
                            for the Pakistanis to cancel the order.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he would like to say a few words about the GDR and
                            Berlin. With the GDR, relations have improved since the agreement five
                            years ago. However, the situation is still precarious and difficult. As
                            to prospects for his own visit to the GDR, the Chancellor said he would
                            not object against making such a visit but the GDR, under Soviet
                            pressure, seems unable to permit more people to leave the country. The
                            Chancellor said he had told Honecker that he could not visit the GDR
                            without some movement on this question. Therefore, he doubted if a visit
                            would take place soon.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then reviewed briefly the Bahro case and the arrest of
                            Huebner, a conscientious objector in East Berlin. He noted that the GDR
                            authorities had not charged Huebner with a refusal to serve in the GDR
                            armed forces, since this would get them involved in matters concerning
                            the status of Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then said that he wished to say a few words about human
                            rights. He noted that 75 to 78 thousand persons of German origin have
                            been able to come to West Germany from Eastern countries within the last
                            18 months. Some 15 thousand have come from the Soviet Union, 50 thousand
                            from Poland and about 15 thousand from the GDR. The FRG wants to see
                            another 75 thousand come out in the future and it does not want to
                            interfere with this process which is going on quite well with the GDR,
                            Poland, the Soviet Union, and Romania. Matters also have been almost
                            settled with Czechoslovakia for the emigration of ethnic Germans there,
                            although not many remain. In view of all this, the Chancellor said he
                            hoped the President would understand that the FRG is a little reluctant
                            to join the US in a worldwide campaign about human rights.</p>
                        <p>The President said he understood. Genscher noted that Principle 7 of the
                            Helsinki Final Act on human rights as well as the language in Basket 3
                            concerned reunification of families and was of great importance for
                            divided countries like Germany. He said the FRG insists on this in
                            dealing with Poland and the other countries. The Chancellor added that
                            he hoped the President would understand his view that there are not only
                            cases like Shcharansky and Ginsburg but there are 75 thousand others who
                            have been able to get out.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said that he wished to inform the President that the
                            Soviets seem increasingly concerned about the US and China. Bulgarian
                            Foreign Minister Mladenov had been here recently, obviously acting for
                            the Soviets, to convey this message, and others had done so as well. The
                            Chancellor had told them that the Chinese hold the Soviets in contempt,
                            and he thought it was a mistake for the Soviets to match this contempt
                            with such a defensive position.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said the French are delivering some military weapons to
                            China. A few of these weapons, such as the Milan missile, contain German
                            technology. There is also talk about delivery of weapons to China by the
                            UK. (The Secretary thought this matter was not active for the time
                            being.) The Chancellor also noted that the Soviets singled out
                            Brzezinski for agitating the Chinese against the Soviets. The Chancellor
                            senses that the Soviets are really nervous about all of this and that
                            their concern is not just for show.</p>
                        <p>The President said he could not disagree with this. Our goal is to have
                            normal diplomatic relations with the Chinese. We recognize that, so far
                            as a security threat is concerned, the Soviets are more important to the
                            US and the FRG than the Chinese. However, there are over one billion
                            people in China and we see that they are turning to the West for the
                            first time. We have to try to explain this to the Soviets. Also, we must
                            be careful, because the Chinese would object violently if they felt we
                            were using them against the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we have made very clear to both the Chinese and the
                            Soviets that we will not supply arms to either one. Genscher said that
                            the Soviets claim that the US is encouraging others to do this, but the
                            President said we have not done so. Brzezinski had heard that the
                            Chinese are trying to get Italian arms. The Chancellor observed that the
                            Italians will sell arms to strange people, and he noted that they have
                            already sold some Leopard tanks to the Libyans.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded at 12:50 pm to permit the President and the
                            Chancellor to proceed to their press conference.</p>

                                <item>we have left the era in which the top levels of the government
                                    have been dominated by people who instinctively look at the
                                    world through European lenses (even Kissinger, with his
                                    background, moved away from that perspective). This reflects the
                                    background of our senior people (who did not serve in the
                                    European war and then found their work dominated by postwar
                                    reconstruction, founding NATO, etc.); and there of course has
                                    been the increase in problem areas <hi rend="italic"

                                <item>the growth of functional issues—most pronounced in this
                                    administration—has had a particular effect on Europe as a
                                    region: so many of these issues have a profound effect on Europe
                                    and become the stuff of our relations with Europeans, yet
                                    institutional responsibility is largely vested in the government
                                    by function, rather than by region. Alone among the regions of
                                    the world, our relations with Western European countries (in
                                    terms of unmet problems) focus more either on what happens <hi
                                        rend="italic">functionally</hi> on a broader basis or on
                                    what happens elsewhere in the world (Soviet Union, Africa,

                                <item>thus <hi rend="italic">institutionally</hi>, key issues for
                                    our relations with Europe have developed in ways in which the
                                    European perspective is often not the dominant factor, or
                                    sometimes even taken into account to the degree that a <hi
                                        rend="italic">coordinated European strategy</hi> would call
                                    for. The most important example at the moment is international
                                    economic policy, where until recently it has not been possible
                                    to gain sufficient realization within the Government as a whole
                                    that what we do in overall international economic policy is
                                    having a critical impact on our <hi rend="italic">political</hi>
                                    relations and position in Europe, as well. Economic policy has
                                    now taken over from Soviet issues as the key European concern
                                    about U.S. “leadership,” “purposefulness,” “reliability,” etc.
                                    To be sure, much of our international economic policy has had a
                                    European dimension (the Bonn Summit, etc.), but there has not
                                    been a sense of how this policy needs on a daily basis to be
                                    fitted within an overall strategy for Western Europe. Perhaps
                                    “strategy” is too strong a word: it is more a matter of
                                    instinctive approaches and practices that automatically see the
                                    relationship of particular, broader issues to the European
                                    dimension.</item>

                        <p>As noted above, in some areas—such as arms control—the European dimension
                            is being effectively handled through an interagency process. But in

                            and we should probably use that mechanism even more. On some issues
                            (e.g. economic policy), the overall coordinating mechanism in the
                            government still needs beefing up, and not just for European reasons
                            (now that the Summit is past, Henry Owen could be invaluable here,
                            provided he is given enough interagency coordinating authority).</p>
                        <p>Of course, there would always be value in a major Presidential speech on
                            Europe, drawing together a number of threads and themes. But that still
                            does not resolve the institutional and bureaucratic problem.</p>
                        <p>What I have to propose for now is modest, but could have wider
                            application later: I suggest my convening an interagency “Germany
                            Group,” on a confidential basis, to focus specifically on relations with
                            that country. The choice is obvious: it is the key European Ally, the
                            one where most problems in relations with West Europe do and will
                            center, and the one where there remains the greatest possibility of
                            renewed misunderstanding and difference of interests.</p>
                        <p>The object would be for this group to meet regularly a) to make sure each
                            agency is up-to-date on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] German attitudes, problems, and needs; b) to act
                            as an early-warning device for different agencies; and c) to do what is
                            possible to ensure that an overall approach for dealing with Germany is
                            built in to individual policies that may have their basic focus either
                            in a function (e.g. arms control, economics, arms sales,
                            non-proliferation) or in other regions (e.g. Africa). More than anything
                            else, this would be a sensitizing and alerting procedure. It <hi

                            issues—such as the problem of competition in high-technology areas.</p>
                        <p>There is also the constant German refrain that there is no senior U.S.
                            official who “understands” them; in part that means they do not have a
                            sense that the German perspective is adequately included in different
                            U.S. policies. This group might help to rectify that problem.</p>
                        <p>This could be a natural outgrowth of the European Problems Group, but
                            with participants more oriented to Germany, and drawing in people from
                            other regions and functional areas, as appropriate. The core group would
                            be State (EUR/PM/EB); DOD (ISA/JCS); Treasury; Commerce; ICA; CIA; and

                            Wischnewski); the need for a separate Carter–Brezhnev channel; and
                                MTN.<note n="3" xml:id="d110fn3">In this sentence, Carter underlined
                                the words “separate Carter-Brezhnev channel;” in the margin next to
                                this sentence, Carter wrote: “a fixation!”</note></p>
                        <p>With regard to the Carter–Brezhnev channel, which Schmidt urged strongly
                            as a way of by-passing Soviet bureaucracy, I indicated that the
                            President might explore this directly with Brezhnev during their
                            possibly forthcoming meeting. In addition, Schmidt agreed to use his
                            Soviet connections to explore the desirability of a direct channel
                            between me and Aleksandrov (Brezhnev’s equivalent to me). Schmidt felt
                            such a link would be useful.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the MTN, Schmidt agreed to be helpful in seeking French
                            and British cooperation but stated he needs more detail and that
                                Strauss<note n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">Reference is to Robert Strauss,
                                Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.</note> tends to “cry
                            wolf” too often.</p>
                        <p>2. I briefed Schmidt in detail regarding Camp David and our further
                            plans. He stated explicitly that he will use Hussein’s November visit to
                            Bonn to press him hard to collaborate. He might also visit Jerusalem (I
                            urged him to do so) and exert his influence on Begin. With regard to
                            Lebanon he showed polite interest in the recent reference by President
                            Carter to a possible conference.</p>
                        <p>3. Following my briefing on SALT, Schmidt asked whether there were
                            limitations implicit in SALT on theater nuclear forces. He was
                            particularly interested in the status of the cruise missile issue.</p>
                        <p>4. The bulk of the time was spent in reviewing the “gray area” nuclear
                            matters. Schmidt voiced the now familiar German concern about possible
                            decoupling. He agreed that a top-level political dialogue on the matter
                            was necessary, lest lower level bureaucratic-military consultations
                            create a dynamic all their own.</p>
                        <p>5. He agreed further that the proper steps in such top-level discussions
                            would involve, first of all, a top-level review of the nature of the
                            problem (to establish if there is a consensus regarding the issue); to
                            be followed, secondly, by a review of what the required military
                            response might be; to be followed, thirdly, by a review of a possible
                            linkage of the foregoing to East–West arms control negotiations.</p>
                        <p>It was evident that Schmidt’s thinking on this issue was not advanced,
                            that he was groping for solutions to a problem which he had not yet
                            clearly formulated, and that he was reflecting a more general anxiety
                            regarding the implications for Europe of apparent strategic
                            deterioration on the part of the West.</p>
                        <p>He reiterated, however, that Germany could not agree alone to the
                            deployment of any new theater nuclear system; that at least one more
                            European country would have to participate (given Germany’s political
                            vulnerability in regard to the other European countries).</p>
                        <p>Toward the conclusion of our discussion Schmidt expressed the view that
                            it would be most desirable for President Carter, himself, as well as
                            Giscard and Callaghan to find some informal occasion prior to next
                            year’s economic summit to meet and discuss this issue in an informal
                                setting.<note n="5" xml:id="d110fn5">Carter, Giscard, Callaghan, and
                                Schmidt met at Guadeloupe, January 5 and 6, 1979; see Documents 27,
                                28, 29.</note></p>
                        <p>6. Schmidt raised the question whether it would not be timely to seek the
                            replacement of NATO Secretary General Luns. I indicated to him that the
                            thought had occurred to us as well, but that the initiative should
                            really come from the Europeans, preferably from a small European
                            country. In regard to successors, Schmidt felt that Thorn, Tidemand (of
                            Norway), or Macdonald (of Canada) would be quite acceptable.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d110fn6">Next to this sentence, Carter wrote: “ok
                                [illegible].”</note></p>
                        <p>7. Schmidt insisted strongly that the new European Monetary System (EMS)
                            was not anti-U.S. and specifically wanted to know whether the President
                            fully understood that. He welcomed the President’s statement to the IMF
                            but inquired whether the President really meant it, for he understands
                            that influential U.S. officials were skeptical.<note n="7"

                        <p>In this connection, he urged the dispatch to Europe of a prominent
                            American financial figure who would discuss the matter fully with
                            Schmidt and report to the President.</p>
                        <p>8. Schmidt reiterated in the course of the conversation his view that the
                            Soviet role in Africa continues to be negative and that the Soviets have
                            not in any significant fashion desisted from their growing
                            military-political support for extremist solutions. He felt that this
                            still calls for a Western response (though he did not indicate how).</p>

                                10/78. Secret; Sensitive. Carter spoke to Schmidt from his study off
                                the Oval Office. In an October 4 memorandum to Carter on the
                                economic issues that might come up in the conversation, Owen wrote:
                                “You may want to point out to Schmidt that these problems—waiver
                                authority, textiles, etc.—underline the central point you want him
                                to make to Giscard: the alternative to a successful MTN is not a
                                continuation of the status quo, but a revival of protectionism that
                                would do great damage. Hence the need for French negotiating
                                positions that will enable us to conclude a successful agreement by
                                December 15, as pledged at the summit.” (Carter Library, National

                            had told Gromyko that the problem was the disparity in data, and
                            (pursuing the idea they had discussed in Bonn), he had suggested to
                            Gromyko that the problem lay in the definition of “troop”. <hi

                            repeated the point several times. He thought that the Soviets want to
                            move, but they cannot admit to false data, so the problem is how to

                            He would also be in touch with the Saudis and with Hussein, who will
                            soon be visiting Bonn. He offered to do anything he could to help toward

                            welcomed the President’s clearcut words on inflation, on reducing
                            imports, on raising exports, and on the stability of the dollar. He
                            noted, in particular, the President’s statement of trust that Europe
                            would fashion the European monetary system in a way that will also
                            strengthen the international monetary system and the IMF. <hi

                            experts on this point. He wished to suggest the idea of the President’s
                            sending a personal representative—an expert in international economics
                            with a political bent—to see him, the head of the central bank, the
                            minister of finance, perhaps even Giscard, so that they could provide
                            him with a picture of the psychological and political side of the
                            problem, and so that the President could be relieved about the
                            consequences of the European monetary arrangements. <hi rend="italic"

                                <item>There has been the general sense of uneasiness in Germany

                                    fact, some of the developments we have been seeing (such as part
                                    of the motivation for EMS, and the intensity of concerns about

                                    its aims and options are limited, and are likely to remain so
                                    for the indefinite future. The Soviet Union may try to meddle
                                    but its opportunities are also limited, and the Germans are
                                    aware of the dangers of doing more than establishing themselves
                                    as second-level players. In time, there is potential for
                                    development of some European defense arrangements to try making

                                    to Germany—no longer seems quite as firm as before. But that is
                                    a more likely approach than toying with a closer association
                                    with the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Germans remain
                                    vitally concerned that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> manage

                                <item>In France, meanwhile, Giscard has assumed a more activist
                                    position now that the elections are behind him. Some of this is
                                    opportunism: such as a partial revival of French efforts to play
                                    an interlocutory role with the Soviet Union. But Giscard is also
                                    facing some “new realities”: including a recognition that the
                                    situation no longer permits the tolerance that deGaulle had to
                                    deny the U.S. position on the Continent. Ironically—but also
                                    logically—as our relative power has gone down, so French concern
                                    to be on better terms with us has gone up. Most important for
                                    France is the classic problem of dealing with Germany. With
                                    Britain on the sidelines, uncertainties about us, and assertions
                                    of German power and <hi rend="italic">angst</hi> at the same
                                    time, it is not surprising that Giscard is pushing hard on the
                                    relationship with Bonn. Nor is it even surprising that he is
                                    getting into an effort like EMS, with its implications for
                                    moving European unity forward and helping to deal with German
                                    power. Here, too, the reduced tolerance in the political
                                    situation no longer permits as much French negativism. Giscard
                                    is covering all bets: but the realistic ones are firmly set in
                                    the context of Western politics.</item>

                                <item>These factors also highlight a further product of lessening
                                    U.S. dominance on the Continent (building on a similar movement
                                    with the onset of superpower detente): the increase in
                                    importance of the intra-European balance of power. That factor
                                    has always been there, but tends to be neglected when the U.S.
                                    position on the Continent is clear, and U.S.–Soviet relations
                                    are clearly defined. Britain, however, is not much of a player:
                                    so it is left to the French to try dealing with the growth of
                                    German power and position largely on its own, with various real
                                    and tactical devices (real: EMS; tactical: European Disarmament

                                <item>In economics, there is genuine concern, primarily in Germany,
                                    about the functioning of Western economic institutions, where a
                                    system based on U.S. predominance and stability is being
                                    questioned. This problem is exacerbated by our continuing high
                                    inflation (which is undermining certainty-of-expectations,
                                    especially for investment), and by the economic and <hi
                                        rend="italic">political</hi> effects of the fall of the
                                    dollar (made worse economically by $600 billion in dollar
                                    “overhang”). In addition, the relative increase in German
                                    economic power is perforce thrusting the FRG forward, with
                                    political consequences on the Continent and a need for greater
                                    German economic leadership and responsibility. Again, the
                                    Germans are not yet comfortable with this new situation, and in
                                    any event recognize that the requirements of global economic
                                    management require an effective U.S. role and the continuation
                                    of cooperative efforts. If we play our part effectively, we will
                                    have to face growing German economic assertiveness; if we do
                                    not, we will also have to face very unsettling tendencies in
                                    both economic and political thinking in Germany. If anything,
                                    the dangers here are greater than in the military field, which
                                    has simpler requirements and a clear <hi rend="italic"

                                    social problems that are also emerging here: for example, the
                                    costs of expensive welfare systems, environmental
                                    considerations—as with nuclear power—that impinge more heavily

                                    and satisfaction for large numbers of young, well-educated
                                    people in slower-growing economies. We often judge governments
                                    that do not deal very well with these problems as essentially
                                    “weak”; but given the magnitude of the problems—and the social
                                    and cultural changes taking place—most European governments are

                        <p>As always in Europe, the key of course is Germany and its evolution. And
                            the most important point for us to remember as the Germans grope their
                            way forward is that <hi rend="italic">we must not give them any reason
                                to doubt our confidence in them</hi>. It is not that they have any
                            realistic option (such as accommodating to Moscow)—or that they would
                            choose that option even if they had it. Rather, it is that we should
                            avoid inhibiting the healthy development in Germany of constructive
                            approaches to its problem of emerging from second-class status to real
                            leadership in Western Europe. In that process, the focus needs to be on
                            aspects of German interests that are compatible with ours, rather than
                            on the more limited agenda of issues where we have differences.</p>

                            dealing with grey areas; and there are thorough consultations (and

                        <p>However, the Germans can be forgiven for being uncertain about the
                            evolution of the thicket of issues relating to defense. These include:
                            the largely unknown effect of advanced technology on conventional arms
                            and stability in Central Europe; the potential blurring of distinctions
                            between conventional and nuclear war (as represented by cruise
                            missiles—which also remain a largely unknown factor); and the relating
                            of TNF to strategic arms in a time of potentially lower strategic
                            forces, more visible Soviet TNF, and a blurring of distinctions between
                            TNF and strategic weapons. Maybe there can be no new comprehensive
                            approach to these issues—which involve doctrine as well as hardware; but
                            in the absence of such a comprehensive approach, anxieties are quite

                                    the game directly. But if we are to move—say, beyond MBFR—then
                                    the way the issue is introduced and pursued is critical.</item>

                        <p>Needless to say, we need to do a lot more basic thinking about this whole
                            basket of issues and inter-relationships. The answers will not be easy
                            to come by: but—as noted above—there is at least a <hi rend="italic"
                                >process</hi> in the Alliance for dealing with the problem, and a
                            common recognition that there are no real alternatives to Atlantic
                            defense partnership.</p>
                        <p>To be sure, there are also a number of other military issues—many turning
                            on money—that have not been resolved with the Germans: e.g. AWACS, the
                            tank gun, and some parts of the LTDP. This is nothing to be alarmist
                            about, and has a long tradition in NATO.</p>
                        <p>Apel on maneuvers raises more questions. In part, the incident reflects
                            his inexperience and pique at the role some “political” generals have
                            played—in particular Haig, though the fire has been directed to others,
                            probably as a cover. Apel also failed to do any p.r. work in Germany on
                            the maneuvers, and may have been trying to cover-up for his failure to
                            prepare public opinion. While not wanting to ignore the question mark
                            that still hangs over this incident, I also believe there is a
                            difference between being prepared to fight a war and stand up to the
                            Soviets, on the one hand, and—on the other—being cautious about chewing
                            up farmland and crowding the roads with maneuver vehicles. Apel’s appeal
                            to the Left-wing of the SPD on a limited issue like this does not
                            necessarily imply any shift on fundamentals. To be Chancellor, however,
                            he will have to steer a steady course on defense issues.</p>
                        <p>We should also be aware of two broader questions: first, the extent to
                            which the Europeans, in general, see the military situation as an
                            unresolved problem of central importance—e.g. how real is the threat of
                            war, as compared with active efforts underway to deter it at all levels
                            and to demonstrate “coupling” of U.S. strategic systems? Second, there
                            is the question of the extent to which we fall into comfortable patterns
                            of ordering our relations with Western Europe through NATO and the
                            military connection, instead of putting more emphasis on other
                            factors—especially, now, economic relations and policies, and political
                            support for a faltering European unity. Judging German reactions to
                            military issues as the touchstone of loyalty to the Atlantic Alliance
                            may miss the point: in a time when war is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            likely, the test of the relationship (and our role in it) increasingly
                            shifts away from the military dimension. In fact, when we are dealing in
                            a hard-to-quantify world of building forces in order to avoid being at a
                            disadvantage in Europe in situations short of crisis or war (e.g.
                            pressures to accommodate to Soviet political interests), it is
                            remarkable that there has been such a positive European response on
                            defense.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic</p>
                        <p>For the Europeans in general, Atlantic economic relations pose a special
                            problem. In the military sphere, the relationship is one of common
                            interest with relatively little difference of opinion (even with regard
                            to France, when the basics are involved). In the economic sphere, by
                            contrast, there is a potential tension between the economic and
                            political advantages of cooperation, on the one hand, and commercial
                            competition on the other. The question “Who gains?” has much greater
                            currency in economic relations than it ever has in defense. Dollar and
                            economic management issues have been posed above; in the longer term,
                            there are also European concerns about expanding markets, keeping “up
                            front” in high technology, and coping with the effects of long-term
                            reduced growth. The French most often take the lead in questioning U.S.
                            “global” policies that seem to confer <hi rend="italic">commercial</hi>
                            advantage (e.g. non-proliferation, conventional arms transfers, <hi
                                rend="italic">Concorde</hi>, two-way street in defense procurement).
                            But the Germans and others are not far behind.</p>
                        <p>This concern must be met, in time. For now, the most important lesson is
                            the need to keep firmly in mind the political impact of our economic
                            policies, and the disciplines that our role and that of the dollar
                            impose: <list>

                                        clear that the leadership of the Administration is being
                                        judged—not so much in terms like the neutron bomb or
                                        U.S.-Soviet relations—but much more on the management of the
                                        U.S. economy, the enactment of energy legislation, and the
                                        role of the dollar. Psychologically, the fall of the dollar
                                        is having a profound impact in Western Europe (with
                                        continual front-page news) and is having an impact on

                                <item>It is also critical for Britain (if at all possible) to get
                                    back into the game. This is why we should find ways (now under
                                    consideration) of encouraging Britain not to “miss the bus” on
                                    the EMS, and of helping London to understand the penalties we
                                    all pay for continuing British ambivalence about the Continent.
                                    Pumping up the British is a long-term effort; in the meantime,
                                    the emergence of a “Bonn-Paris axis” is the next best thing,
                                    provided that we are constantly involved in shaping its
                                    directions and establishing its limits—largely through our own
                                    forthcoming positions and actions in economics and defense.
                                    Trying to substitute a Washington-Bonn axis for a viable
                                    intra-European balance of power is not the answer, for obvious
                                    reasons, and we should continue to mute the inevitable dominance
                                    of that connection, by as much as possible continuing to draw in
                                    Britain, France, and—as much as possible—the other
                                    Allies.</item>

                                    the point about confidence in Germany. This means accentuating
                                    the positive in relations with Germany (and France); increasing
                                    contacts at the higher governmental levels; leaning heavily on
                                    traditional military and economic cooperation themes; using all
                                    the multinational forums open to us; and not blowing problems
                                    out of proportion. This means keeping grey areas and decoupling
                                    in perspective; and, in particular, understanding the economic
                                    issues and how far we have to go in meeting them.</item>

                        <p>Getting the psychology right also means, of course, learning to live with
                            the new frustrations of actually having to listen to the Allies during
                            “consultations” on issues like grey areas and ERW—and having to respond
                            to them on economic questions—whereas before we had the relative power
                            and position simply to get our way. A new experience for us: but one
                            that will become more demanding on our patience and ability to adapt,

                                reported that in a March 1 talk Schmidt expressed his concerns about
                                possible U.S.-FRG misunderstandings on TNF, saying that “he wanted
                                to make clear that he continued to adhere completely to the
                                statements he had made to the President at Guadaloupe. The Federal
                                Government under his direction would do its full part to close any
                                gaps in the deterrent strength of the West in the European theater,
                                and he said we should not be distracted by what Wehner or others in
                                the SPD may say from time to time. Schmidt said: ‘I can handle
                                them.’ However, he stressed repeatedly that, as he had explained at
                                Guadeloupe, the FRG could not be the only country in NATO Europe
                                where long-range nuclear weapons are deployed in the future.”

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> I would like to have a question in
                            this context. Would it be appropriate at this time to mention that
                            within the Alliance we are very pleased in evaluating absolutely on one
                            side the deployment proposals but on the other side also the arms

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Yes, that would be perfectly
                            alright; in fact, I believe that it would be helpful.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I don’t know how you feel about
                            publicly expressing concern about the inequality of capability—bringing
                            into the question the SS–20, for instance—but whatever you might do to
                            publicize the problem as expressed through your own eyes and from your
                            own perspective I think it would be very good, and if you could
                            emphasize the harmony with which we ourselves have consulted on this
                            already and my pledges to continue this process during the time
                            following SALT II, all those elements would be helpful not only to
                            yourself but to me and our countries.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor:</hi> I would certainly do so. I will
                            mention the fact that the SS–20 buildup is giving us concern.</p>

                            that we have been talking about it, that we are approaching that complex
                            of problems in harmony and cooperation. And I would also take the
                            opportunity to repudiate a remark Brezhnev made three days ago that the
                            Federal Republic of Germany was under strong pressure from the Pentagon.
                            I don’t know whether you have seen that remark.</p>

                        <p>West–German relations should be better than they are. Many previous
                            irritants no longer exist: troop support payments, the Mansfield
                                Amendment,<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">See <ref target="#d112fn4"
                                    >Document 112, footnote 4</ref>.</note> the Berlin problem,
                            and—for the moment—the West German–Brazilian treaty.</p>
                        <p>Yet they have significantly worsened since this administration came into
                            office. They are unlikely soon to improve unless major initiatives are
                            taken to make them do so.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, they have been worsening while the Soviet Union has been
                            cultivating Bonn more intensively than at any previous time, while
                            simultaneously threatening it militarily by the SS–20 buildup and
                            politically by hinting that unless Soviet-West German relations remain
                            good, Bonn will lose some of its Ostpolitik gains vis-à-vis the GDR.</p>
                        <p>Finally, these changes have been going on at a time when, as a result of
                            West German awareness of dissidence in the GDR, plus rising West German
                            power, FRG public opinion is again absorbed with “the German question”
                            and therefore more susceptible to Moscow’s cultivation of it.</p>
                        <p>The surface problem in Bonn–Washington relations is the mutual crisis of
                            confidence. It is worse on the German side, for Washington is more
                            important to Bonn than Bonn to Washington. Moreover, Chancellor Schmidt,
                            despite some attempts at self-restraint, retains a deep distrust of the
                            administration’s competence, unity, and decisiveness. (He is not ‘‘anti-
                            American,’’ his is more the case of a disillusioned admirer.)</p>
                        <p>But this is a problem which can be, and in some small part has been,
                            alleviated. What is more serious is that three new, basic “objective”
                            problems have arisen which have not been solved and which are the
                            underlying causes of the deterioration of Bonn–Washington relations.
                            These are: (1) international/economics and finance, (2) security, and
                            (3) relations with the USSR and the PRC.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">International Economics and Finance</hi>. The
                            economic positions and policies of the U.S. and the FRG have
                            increasingly diverged. While FRG economic indicators are favorable and
                            U.S. ones are not, to the point where the U.S. can no longer take major
                            international economic decisions without the FRG (and Japan)
                            cooperating, the FRG’s potential energy dependency is far worse than
                            that of the U.S. and it has far less political or military potential to
                            insure its safety of energy supply and price. Moreover, the FRG is more
                            dependent on exports than the U.S. and the fall of the dollar and the
                            rise of the deutschmark potentially endangers it more.</p>
                        <p>As a result, FRG and U.S. perceptions have diverged. Bonn sees Washington
                            endangering the FRG‘s economic position by the dollar’s decline while
                            asking the FRG to help it improve its own economic position, which, Bonn
                            is convinced, has deteriorated because of lack of U.S. discipline re oil
                            imports and inflation control. Washington sees Bonn wanting to preserve
                            its balance of payments surplus and refusing to reflate to help
                            OECD-wide recovery. The more OPEC oil prices go up, the more Bonn’s and
                            Washington’s interests will diverge. The Schmidt- and Giscard-sponsored
                            EMS arose largely from Schmidt’s political decision that, Washington
                            having “abdicated international economic leadership,” he and Giscard
                            must try to fill the gap.<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">As he said
                                recently at an Aspen Berlin conference which I attended. [Footnote
                                in the original. On March 1 and 2, Schmidt took part in a conference
                                on “The Federal Republic of Germany: Its Role in World Affairs,” at
                                the Aspen Institute Berlin. (Conor Cruise O’Brien, “Spirit of One
                                Germany,” <hi rend="italic">The Observer</hi>, March 4, 1979)
                                Griffith also participated in the conference.]</note></p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Security</hi>. Here also the Bonn-Washington
                            relationship suffers from increasing asymmetry. Although the Bundeswehr
                            is stronger and NATO is building up, the USSR has built up so much more
                            militarily that Bonn is more dependent on Washington for its security
                            than ever before. As Chancellor Schmidt himself first pointed out (in an
                            IISS speech in London in October 1977), because this Soviet buildup, in
                            the form of SS–20 and Backfire, has greatly increased the FRG’s
                            “security deficit,” countermeasures are required from the military point
                            of view.<note n="4" xml:id="d115fn4">See <ref target="#d112fn3">Document
                                    112, footnote 3</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Only the U.S. can soon and effectively compensate for this new FRG
                            security deficit in nuclear weapons by increasing the range and
                            effectiveness of Pershing missiles in the FRG and/or targetting on the
                            USSR more missiles based outside the FRG; and in conventional weapons,
                            by the U.S. deploying itself and/or a giving Bonn for deployment, based
                            in the FRG U.S. cruise missile technology. Both of these steps would,
                            for the first time, mean that missiles based in the FRG could be
                            targetted on Soviet territory.</p>
                        <p>It is natural, therefore, that the Soviets have been so anxious in the
                            SALT II negotiations to limit cruise missile ranges and to limit
                            Backfire vis-à-vis North America but not Western Europe. This brings me
                            to the linkage between security and political problems in FRG and <hi
                                rend="italic">U.S. relations with the USSR and the PRC</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Since early 1978 the USSR has been cultivating the SPD. Its main purposes
                            seem to be to prevent any increase in FRG military strength and
                            improvement in FRG relations with the PRC, within the general context of
                            Moscow’s principal defensive objective: to avoid encirclement by all
                            actual or potential major nuclear powers: The U.S. the FRG, Britain,
                            France, the PRC, and Japan.</p>
                        <p>Within this context, the USSR is trying to turn Bonn’s <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ostpolitik</hi> gains to its advantage. These gains have been
                            primarily in the GDR, the principal area of Bonn’s concern in the East
                            outside the USSR itself. The principal objective of Bonn’s <hi
                                rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi> was, as Brandt put it, ‘‘the
                            maintenance of the substance of the nation”—that is, to keep common
                            German national consciousness alive in the GDR, in the long-run hope of
                            rapprochement and eventual reunification. Bonn’s <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ostpolitik</hi> has scored some successes in this respect:
                            6,000,000 West Germans visit the GDR every year; there is much greater
                            intra-German trade; West Berlin lives unharassed; the West German
                            Deutschmark has become the second currency of the GDR; and 80% of all
                            East Germans watch West German television every evening.</p>
                        <p>If one is a German patriot (and <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">fortiori</hi> if one is a German nationalist), these
                            are no small gains, and they are well worth paying something to preserve
                            them.</p>
                        <p>This is the West German background to the new Soviet cultivation of the
                            FRG. Because the FRG has a special interest in the GDR, it has a
                            special, stronger interest, in the SPD’s and FDP’s view—and even, if the
                            cards are down, in the CDU’s as well—in keeping Soviet-U.S. detente
                            going. For if detente collapses, <hi rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi>
                            probably will also. Moreover, the SPD has long regarded arms control
                            measures in Europe as essential for the FRG’s security and maintenance
                            of the gains of <hi rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi>. Yet the FRG’s <hi

                            European powers.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union is thus offering Bonn a carrot—maintenance of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Ostpolitik’s</hi> gains—while brandishing a
                            stick—SS–20 and Backfire deployment, and it is trying to make the
                            continuation of the former dependent on Bonn’s limiting its—and
                            NATO’s—response to the latter. And there are significant signs in the
                            FRG, particularly in the SPD, that Bonn’s policy is being affected by
                            this Soviet cultivation. To put it another way, as Richard Lowenthal has
                            said, Moscow is quite willing for Bonn to remain in NATO as long as Bonn
                            follows arms control policies in it parallel to some extent with
                            Moscow’s.</p>
                        <p>Moscow’s aims are similar with respect to the ‘‘Chinese card.” The
                            Soviets are trying to persuade Bonn that detente and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ostpolitik</hi> are endangered by Washington’s improvement of
                            relations with Beijing. Schmidt, conversely, has little or no confidence
                            in Washington’s ability to ‘‘play the Chinese card,” and even if he did,
                            he thinks its being played dangerous for the FRG’s interests in
                            maintaining detente and <hi rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi>. (The FRG is
                            still very provincial and Eurocentric. Few West Germans understand that
                            Washington’s China policy has made Brezhnev (as his recent election
                            speech showed) more, not less, interested in detente, not only because
                            of their geopolitical shortsightedness but also because they have no
                            confidence in the administration’s foreign policy <hi rend="italic">tout
                                court.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>The present serious controversy in West Germany about the appropriate
                            answer to the SS–20 was precipitated by Herbert Wehner’s demand that the
                            FRG not allow any U.S. deployment of new or modernized missiles on FRG
                            soil unless and until there were new arms control negotiations on the
                            subject with the USSR. (Brezhnev had earlier proposed much the same.)
                            The CSU demanded such deployment immediately, before negotiations; the
                            CDU was only slightly less strong; the FDP wanted deployment and
                            negotiations. Schmidt cannot afford to offend either the FDP or Wehner.
                            His fresh memories of the neutron bomb controversy made him feel that if
                            he offered FRG soil for U.S. deployment, the U.S. might, as he saw it,
                            again pull the rug out from under him. Like Wehner, he wants to preserve
                            the gains of <hi rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi>. (He has commented
                            favorably on Brezhnev’s proposal for European arms control
                            negotiations.)</p>
                        <p>His solution has essentially been to delay. He insists that (a) the
                            answer to the SS–20 is primarily a problem for the U.S., (b) it must be
                            handled in the NATO context, (c) any new deployment or modernization
                            must not be only on FRG soil, (d) arms control negotiations should occur
                            before any deployment.</p>
                        <p>Does all this mean that Wehner, or even Schmidt, are “self-Finlandized?”
                            Only Wehner, and only in part. Why? Until 1959–1960, and again now,
                            Wehner has given priority to reunification, or at least rapprochement
                            with the GDR, over European unity and, until 1959, even NATO. He has
                            been the principal motor behind <hi rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi>
                            vis-à-vis the GDR. He is a German patriot, even a German nationalist,
                            and his priority No. 1 is “the maintenance of the substance of the
                            nation.” He does not want the FRG to become another Finland; on the
                            contrary, he wants the GDR to become one. Wehner is, in short, a strong
                            proponent of FRG “peaceful engagement” with and in the GDR. Moscow and
                            East Berlin know this, of course, and therefore engage with him as
                            leerily as he with them.</p>
                        <p>But engagement also implies negotiations and therefore mutual
                            concessions. And Wehner is prepared to make the kind of concessions to
                            maintain the substance of the nation which, from the viewpoint of NATO,
                            of the USG, and of the CDU/CSU endanger the FRG’s security position by
                            not making up its security deficit, without any probable major Eastern
                            concessions in return. To put it another way, the US has less interest
                            in the GDR than Wehner does, and more interest in repairing NATO’s
                            security deficit.</p>
                        <p>Where does this leave Schmidt? In my judgment he is less interested in
                            the GDR than Wehner is, but he is still interested enough—as indeed, one
                            must always remember, the vast majority of patriotic citizens of the FRG
                            are and will be for the foreseeable future, so that this is one factor,
                            but not the principal one, in his calculations. He feels he was trapped
                            in the neutron bomb controversy and does not intend to be again.</p>
                        <p>He must maneuver between the FDP and Wehner. In my judgment, unlike
                            Wehner, Schmidt is not self-Finlandized. But he has lost sufficient
                            confidence in the present administration, and he is sufficiently
                            interested in maintaining the substance of the nation, so that he is
                            prepared to negotiate with Moscow on this range of issues. And he is not
                            prepared, in my judgment, to give in to U.S. persuasion or pressure to
                            agree, for example, to solve the problem by U.S. deployment of Pershing
                            II on FRG soil only.</p>
                        <p>There are NATO military and political task forces working on this
                            problem. But in my judgment, unless rapid action is taken to head it
                            off, we are heading for another bomb controversy, this time one
                            involving FRG domestic politics more than that did, and therefore more
                            dangerous for FRG–US relations.</p>
                        <p rend="center">********</p>
                        <p>Behind all these issues, and most important and difficult to understand,
                            is a growing malaise, an estrangement of perceptions and emotions,
                            between the U.S. and the FRG. No wonder! <hi rend="italic">Never</hi> in
                            history have two nations like the FRG and Japan had such economic
                            power—and the FRG such conventional military power—and yet been so
                            totally dependent on one super-power, the U.S., to defend them against
                            another, the USSR. And when one adds, for the FRG, the partition of
                            Germany, when one thinks of Germany’s alternation between empire and
                            collapse during the last century, and when one thinks that Poland was
                            not lost during 125 years of partition, must one not believe that
                            “Germany is not yet lost”—at least in the minds and hearts of this and
                            the next generation?</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there is another, growing barrier to U.S.–FRG understanding:
                            the passing from power of both post-war generations. Fewer every year,
                            in Washington and Bonn, actively and emotionally participated in the
                            Soviet-U.S. cold war, the “golden age” of U.S.–FRG relations. Many
                            younger, left-wing Americans reflect the anti-German suspicions of the
                            pre-cold war period. The U.S. has become less Eurocentric. U.S. travel,
                            study, and concern about Germany is less. Americans’ ability to read and
                            speak German is declining even more rapidly. The generation of German
                            emigres in America is dying out.</p>
                        <p>This analysis is intentionally pessimistic. True, the U.S. and the FRG
                            are so bound to each other that I cannot foresee anything like a breakup
                            of their alliance. But to manage that alliance has become more
                            difficult—at a time when, I think, it is the more necessary. Alliances,
                            like plants, need constant watering: this memorandum suggests why and
                            how to do it.</p>

                                Outside the System. Sent for action. A copy was sent to Griffith. A
                                stamp at the top of the page reads: “ZB has seen.” At the top of the
                                page, Aaron wrote: “ZB—The problem is to find something <hi

                                in some more outsiders like Guido Goldman. __ Yes __ No. DA.”
                                Brzezinski indicated his approval of this suggestion. Goldman was a

                                    would be helpful for this group (so far only advisory) to become

                                <item>On political review of economic negotiation, this is the most
                                    glaring bureaucratic shortcoming that I know of in the
                                    government on foreign policy issues, in general, and towards
                                    Europe (and Germany) in particular. To get this idea moving will
                                    need some high-powered intervention and sorting out—ideally with
                                    an increased role for Henry Owen.<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5"

                                <item>On TNF, it is true that relating the process (well-organized
                                    and run) with “U.S. and FRG relations with the USSR and the CPR”
                                    is the most significant gap. Discussing those interconnections
                                    here (and interagency) would be very helpful.<note n="6"

                                    it has proved to be too weak to deal effectively with these
                                    issues from its end. More is possible—and your seeing von Staden
                                    would be useful—but I don’t hold out much hope through the

                                    would be useful. I have also believed through two Summits that
                                    the “successor generation” issues should be discussed among the
                                    Seven, as well. (C)</item>

                        <p>I will schedule an early meeting of the Germany Working Group (including
                            more NSC staff), and work closely with Bill on the agenda. It would also
                            be valuable for him to make an opening presentation. If you approve, I
                            will push the group into more task-oriented directions, and also have
                            the group meet more frequently.<note n="8" xml:id="d116fn8">Brzezinski

                        <p>Since your visit to Germany, there has been a general improvement of
                            relations with the Federal Republic, as much of the underbrush of German
                            doubts about US leadership and resolve on specific issues has been cut
                            away. Your individual successes have been important: especially support
                            for the dollar, the Egypt-Israel Treaty, and now SALT, where Schmidt has
                            been strong in his support and enlisted that of Margaret Thatcher as
                            well. SALT II has also been particularly important in easing a central
                            German preoccupation: doubts that we could manage relations with the
                            Soviet Union effectively. (S)</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, real German doubts about our directions, leadership, and
                            effectiveness remain—abetted by a chronic German habit of magnifying
                            domestic US criticism of any administration. Central to these doubts are
                            our difficulties with energy and inflation, which also reinforce
                            uncertainties that we will follow through effectively on TNF (avoiding
                            another neutron bomb, on the one hand, or ignoring German political
                            needs on the other). (S)</p>
                        <p>The Germans—like the other allies—are also having difficulty adjusting to
                            new facts of international life brought about by shifts in relative
                            power: the onset of Soviet–American strategic parity, and the <hi

                            with Europe and Japan. (S)</p>
                        <p>The Germans’ concerns also derive from their own immediate situation:
                            they have emerged from the time when they were comfortable with
                            political limitations imposed by their unique history, but they are
                            ambivalent about assuming leadership themselves, even in Western
                            Europe—for example, on aid to Turkey, though Schmidt eventually came
                            through after we clearly resumed the lead.<note n="9" xml:id="d117fn9"
                                >Reference is to West German efforts to assemble a consortium for

                            German need for a clear sense of American steadiness and purpose has
                            increased, at this changing and uncertain time in their history; and
                            this need is increased by the growth of problems (e.g. Iran and oil,
                            Soviet expansionism, chronic global economic difficulties) where Germany
                            is directly affected, but alone can do little. (S)</p>
                        <p>Schmidt did try two limited experiments in leadership: combining with
                            France to promote the European Monetary System (which became relatively
                            unimportant as soon as our monetary actions began to take hold); and his
                            November 1977 speech on theater nuclear forces.<note n="10"

                            Schmidt has been somewhat chastened by this first entry into the big
                            leagues of nuclear strategy, as he and his colleagues have had to face
                            political and strategic responsibilities they were unprepared to face.
                            TNF issues also provoked the German defense debate in March, which among
                            other things revealed that Schmidt is less in control of his own
                            coalition than had been believed. He is therefore very much concerned
                            that we take command of this issue. (S)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Detente:</hi> The defense debate in March brought home
                            clearly to Schmidt that he needs to be better able to integrate
                            necessary efforts in defense (especially TNF) with a concept of detente,
                            in order to maintain coalition support for his overall approach to
                            East-West issues. Yet unlike defense issues, we have had no systematic
                            discussions with the Germans on detente in this administration—unlike
                            the practice when Kissinger used his German background to good effect.
                            Nor do we have any senior-level officials to whom the Germans
                            instinctively relate. If he raises the subject, therefore, you might
                            amplify your views by suggesting that our two embassies, and senior
                            officials, include detente issues in their regular consultations (along
                            with the other allies). (S)</p>

                            Bundestag will vote on whether to extend the Statute of Limitations on
                            murder, which will otherwise expire at the end of the year. Chances for
                            passage are good, although a possible “compromise” is emerging that will
                            limit prosecutable crimes to the less encompassing “genocide.” Schmidt
                            has taken the lead in support of extending the Statute. Stu, Ed and I

                            rest of the agenda is some confidential items. MBFR needs to be pursued
                            between the two of them. Some of this will come up at the Vienna summit,
                            but the U.S. will be constrained by guidance from the FRG. What are the
                            Chancellor’s views?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that these are the points that
                            they have and which he has prepared for. On the Middle East, there are

                            was over Whitsuntide.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said it is very pleasant now.</p>

                            made large grain purchases.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that is a pity that parching

                            large in their consciousness! The Chancellor has been talking about oil
                            with other officials.<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4">For Schmidt’s June 6
                                meeting with Blumenthal, Schlesinger, and Owen, see <ref
                                    target="#d118fn1">footnote 1</ref>, above.</note> We are
                            increasingly concerned with the oil situation. In the U.S. political
                            realm, there are several problems: shortages, price rises, spot
                            shortages in tractor fuel and home heating oil. This is our number one
                            political issue. Congress, however, is now more willing to act. OPEC has
                            increased its prices by 30% so far this year, and the price may go up
                            more during 1979. The spot market on some products has actually risen to
                            $52 a barrel. There is a one- to two-million barrel a day shortage in
                            the world, made more difficult by an uncertain system of global
                            distribution.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that all governments are
                            having trouble convincing their public of the necessities in this area,
                            and thus the troubles are compounded. Some want to believe that there
                            are no shortages, that it is a conspiracy by the companies. Others want
                            to believe that nuclear power will destroy mankind’s environment. And
                            still others believe that no extra energy is needed while maintaining
                            full employment. We need to bundle our efforts together and convince
                            public opinion. This will be easier if we act jointly.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> agreed. He hopes they can reach a
                            common approach on limiting imports, dealing with price distortions, and
                            limiting competition in the spot market. If we can agree, this will
                            work, and some responsible OPEC countries might join in. With the
                            Iranian situation, there has been some cut in production by other OPEC
                            countries, increasing their incomes through pushing up the price in an
                            indiscriminate way. Our costs for oil this year will go up $20 billion,
                            even if there is no further price increase.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary Blumenthal</hi> said that last year the cost
                            was $42 billion, and it will be in excess of $52 billion this year. If
                            the price rises from $18 a barrel, then the cost will be $54–55
                            billion.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that the oil companies buy
                            products at much higher prices.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that there is a need to see
                            the energy field from two angles: first, on decisions to take now. Some
                            are medium and long term, some are stop-gap. To make the policy
                            credible, to impress the producer countries, and to channel
                            restructuring efforts in economies, then we need a second approach:
                            long-term answers. He would like some of these to come out at Tokyo. The
                            long-term necessity includes the role of conservation, and the role of
                            nuclear power—which will be needed for two to three decades (and on
                            which we need jointly to prepare public opinion). On fast breeders,
                            there are perhaps ten years in which to decide, but the option should
                            not be foreclosed. Also there is coal, lignite, shale. We should jointly
                            urge putting regularly great sums into research and development for new
                            technologies, in effect to use coal and develop inexhaustible resources
                            like geothermal, etc. Otherwise there will be economic disaster: in the
                            first instance for the developing countries, in the second instance for
                            the industrial countries. This order of events is not understood in
                            developing countries, nor was it at the Manila UNCTAD meeting. We are
                            heading to an economic crisis, deeper than that of 1974–77, because of
                            oil.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that this was an excellent
                            analysis. There is a package before Congress. Oil price decontrol
                            started here on June first, and will bring prices up to the world level.
                            He has proposed a windfall profits tax, taking 50% plus OPEC price
                            increases over $16 a barrel. This will go into a fund for research and
                            development and for rapid transit. We also need to explore an agreement
                            not to bid above the OPEC price on the spot market, and to minimize the
                            role of the spot market to establish prices in OPEC minds. OPEC profits
                            go up as the spot market goes up. Even though it is only 3% of the
                            global market, it affects prices severely. We all would be more at ease
                            in accepting this approach if there were an IEA distribution system. We
                            also need to get the help of the developing countries. Before, they saw
                            us as enemies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that they have now had second
                            thoughts. He has worked on this for two years. With regard to the spot
                            market and allocation, some countries (not Germany) would have
                            reservations. He is not sure it would function well, or in a year or so.
                            It could only be a stop-gap.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> agreed. It could not be long term.
                            But the spot market is now out of control. This approach could be done
                            without confrontation with OPEC; they have called for conservation, and
                            asked us to minimize the use of the spot market price. This is tongue in
                            cheek, but we can use their statements as a basis for action.</p>
                        <p>On Three-Mile Island, our analysis is nearly done. We will share it with
                            West Germany and others.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that this will be welcome.
                            Publics need to be convinced that all is being done that is possible. We
                            will not really learn very much, but will show that we are learning what
                            is possible.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that he doubts the report will
                            assugge U.S. concerns about nuclear power. In London (May 1977) he had
                            said that the U.S. was aroused on this issue; now Europe is, as
                            well.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that all social diseases come
                            from the U.S.!</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said we also keep them!</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> disagreed. Campus unrest, for
                            example, came to an end here first.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that while he was campaigning
                            back in 1976, 22 out of 50 states had already placed referenda on the
                            ballot on nuclear power. Most were defeated; but the issue will stay
                            with us. There is a need now for light water reactors. In his budget
                            proposal there is $500 million on breeder research, and we are committed
                            to this R and D. No pilot plant is needed now, since we have sufficient
                            light water reactor fuel. We do have a light water breeder, under
                            Rickover. They can talk about this subject at Tokyo. They should assess
                            the oil issue before the OPEC meeting.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that he had talked with
                            Secretaries Blumenthal and Schlesinger; our countries are on a
                            converging track. It may not be necessary to go into those issues now.
                            But they had not dealt with economic policy going beyond energy. His
                            view is that the U.S. has been very successful (though perhaps too much
                            in too short a time) on stabilizing the dollar.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> joked that this is what the
                            Chancellor had asked for!</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that the U.S. was more
                            successful than many observers had expected. He hoped we would not lapse
                            back. If we look to the results of U.S. monetary and fiscal policies, we
                            had done better than expected. He is fully satisfied we would not see
                            the dollar go too high. Perhaps we could flatten its volatility, but it
                            is healthy for the U.S. and for the world to see a powerful and
                            respected dollar again. This is appreciated.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that we will continue to
                            address the underlying causes of inflation. His goal in the 1981 budget
                            is a balanced budget. He has cut a $66 billion deficit to close to $25
                            billion now. If economic circumstances do not drastically change, he
                            will be able to balance the budget.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that this alone will not end
                            inflationary trends. With monetary policy restrictions, there will be
                            some hardships for firms and workers. In Germany, they had a drop in the
                            inflation rate from 7.9% to 2.6% in five years.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he tries to get the American
                            people to learn patience on this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that it is a problem of
                            sweating it out. They faced price increases from deficits incurred by
                            the United States government and others. The FRG now has 3.5% of its GNP
                            in deficit public spending; the U.S. is about half that rate. The FRG
                            had a 2.5% inflation rate, and now it is 3.9%. This <hi rend="italic"
                                >may</hi> reach 5% by the end of 1979. This is the proof of what he
                            had told the President last year, that he would be pressing Germany to
                            reinflate. This leads to inflationary pressures, which are also
                            nourished by the dollar’s rise and the fall of the Deutschmark.</p>

                            will have meetings for four hours each day, and talks at social events
                            in the evenings. This was a surprise to us. They proposed a communique
                            that was remarkably acceptable to us. It is primarily about SALT II, and

                            publicly set deadline. He hopes it can be fulfilled, but it could lead
                            to superficial decisions on some important details. He would hate for
                            them to have to be amended, after the effort in getting public and
                            parliamentary agreements, in Holland, Belgium, etc.</p>

                            parliamentary process will be as difficult for them (the Germans) as the
                            SALT II ratification process is for the President.</p>

                            indeed be very difficult (and the Chancellor agreed). He asked the
                            Chancellor about the possibility that other Allies would agree on the
                            deployment of cruise missiles or the Pershing II Extended Range missile.
                            And how best can the two of them work together to get the cooperation of
                            other Allies? If they (other Allies) reject deployments, politically,
                            this would be a terrible signal to send to the Soviets, that we could
                            not meet the challenge of the SS–20.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> agreed. Therefore, he asks that we
                            not let ourselves be hamstrung by timing, in order to permit trying out
                            different mixes of weapons and deployment options. If the other Allies
                            refuse, then it (i.e. TNF deployments) will not be done.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said he understood. He hopes by then
                            that talks will have started with the Soviets on SALT III.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> asked if that meant by the end of

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> agreed; and there will be
                            preliminary discussions at Vienna, not including TNF, but on RV and
                            missile limits. He thinks the Soviets will be reluctant to discuss
                            specifics at Vienna, but we will explore with them some specific
                            suggestions. There is a necessity for decisions taken by European
                            countries on deploying cruise missiles and Pershings to be tied in with
                            common decisions on TNF arms control. This is not a rigid tying, but an
                            association of the two subjects. Therefore, he has wanted movement on
                            this in 1979.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chancellor</hi> said that acceptance of a mix of
                            weapons—what he calls Eurostrategic weapons, to offset the SS–20 and
                            Backfire—in the minds of parliaments and public opinion in Europe,
                            depends in part on the credibility of the United States’ undertaking to
                            include mutual limitations of Eurostrategic weapons in SALT III. There
                            is some danger, that is not taken seriously by some opponents in Western
                            Europe, that at the end one will say one has to deploy new long range
                            TNF even without an idea of optimum limits on Eurostrategic weapons.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> said that we will be in the
                            forefront on this issue, and will assume the leadership role, working
                            with ‘‘you.” We will make a commitment to spending on the development
                            and deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles. If SALT III is
                            successful, then we can decide accordingly; if the Soviets agree on
                            limits, then we can cut back on TNF deployments. The only cost in that
                            case would be in terms of U.S. spending that would already be done. We
                            are ready to move, cooperating closely with the FRG. We need early
                            guidance and responses from European nations. If we cannot meet the
                            December schedule, then we can modify it. In July, after Tokyo, David
                            Aaron will go to Europe with an outline of our TNF ideas.<note n="7"

                        <p>There is a problem to be faced—where the President and Chancellor may
                            disagree—concerning how much emphasis to place on sea-based weapons.
                            Some nations may not want Pershings or GLCMs on their soil, and
                            therefore will focus only on sea-based weapons. However, if we open this
                            up as a viable option, then all will say they want U.S. ships cruising
                            offshore with TNF, and have no land-based deployments.</p>

                            measures—which would then be in accordance with Budapest—which would be
                            discussed at CSCE in Madrid and, number two, verification measures,
                            which should be under MBFR. This seems to him to make sense. It also
                            seems to be acceptable to the Soviet Union. Therefore this leaves
                            associated measures in MBFR as far as verification is concerned. We have
                            used up too much time to come forward on this. In the first instance,
                            some U.S. aides have too generously disposed of the pathological impact
                            of some associated measures on his people. Germany is the size of Oregon
                            with 61 million people. Some U.S. officials seem disposed to see 150
                            Soviet teams; this would be difficult to digest by his people. Could we
                            see this in Oregon? This is difficult to see. Therefore, there is a need
                            to redress the order of magnitude in a qualitative way: such as

                            $50 million in outright grant military aid, as opposed to repayment on
                            concessional terms. This is the only issue left.</p>

                                Brzezinski’s talk with Schmidt, Carter spoke to Schmidt by telephone

                            Chancellor Schmidt had enjoyed his stay at Bohemian Grove and the

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi> replied that he had enjoyed his
                            stay there very much and that he had done a lot of “lobbying” on SALT.
                            He had talked in particular with Kissinger, Ford and Haig. (C)</p>
                        <p>Noting that unfortunately he would not have as much time for discussion
                            as he had originally hoped, <hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski</hi> said
                            he had three points which he wished to raise with Chancellor Schmidt.
                            The first was regarding the recent Cabinet shuffles.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d119fn3">Reference is to Carter’s decision to replace
                                several Cabinet members, including in particular Blumenthal and

                            processes and objectives in the foreign policy generally and that these
                            moves did not imply any foreign policy shift. This was particularly true
                            in the financial field where Bill Miller would continue implementing the
                            policies which Mike Blumenthal had tried to carry out. Dr. Brzezinski
                            also reiterated the President’s firm commitment toward meaningful
                            long-range energy program. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi> said he understood this and
                            that he did not expect any major changes in U.S. policy as a result of
                            recent changes. He said that he had full faith in Bill Miller, who was a
                            close friend, and was sure he would do a good job as replacement for
                            Blumenthal. He emphasized that Miller’s rapid confirmation was
                            particularly important for the international monetary situation. (C)</p>
                        <p>Turning to the second point, <hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski</hi> raised
                            the issue of the U–2 flights over Turkey, which he stressed were very
                            important for SALT verification. He briefed Chancellor Schmidt on some
                            of the technical aspects of verification and why these particular
                            flights were important. In particular, he emphasized that these were not
                            spying missions but rather would be used solely for verification
                            purposes, pointing out the differences between these flights and past
                            U–2 activities. He said that it would be useful if Chancellor Schmidt
                            could raise the U–2 issue with the Russians whom he said did not seem to
                            grasp the vital importance of the issue for SALT ratification. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi> agreed to do what he could in
                            this regard. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski</hi> then turned to the third issue
                            which he wished to discuss—TNF modernization. He stressed the importance
                            in maintaining some shared target date and pointed to December as a time
                            when the U.S. hoped some alliance decision should be ready. While he
                            admitted that this date should not be cast in concrete, he also
                            cautioned in showing too much flexibility and reiterated the importance
                            of maintaining a firm target date. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi> replied that in principle he
                            would be willing to make a decision, but he was not sure that the
                            alliance would be ready. His main concern was to achieve a good
                            decision. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski</hi> emphasized the crucial role which
                            Schmidt would play politically in the decision process. He asked him to
                            use his influence with the Belgian Socialists and Italian Socialists,
                            particularly Craxi and Simonet. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi> emphasized that the Federal
                            Republic was prepared to go forward on two conditions: (1) that there be
                            no singularity, and (2) that modernization be combined with some form of
                            arms control. The latter point he emphasized was extremely important.
                            TNF had to be combined with some arms control initiative, otherwise it
                            would not get support in Europe. On the one hand the alliance had to
                            take certain steps to modernize; on the other, they needed to work out
                            arms control measures. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski</hi> said that we should have an arms
                            control proposal for the Soviets by December but that we intended to go
                            ahead with modernization. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi> reminded Dr. Brzezinski of his
                            domestic political problems, stating that he had been “burned once” and
                            did not wish to be burned again. He hoped Dr. Brzezinski understood
                            this. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski</hi> said that he did and noted that

                        <p>Before departing, <hi rend="italic">Chancellor Schmidt</hi> said that
                            there were two points he wished to raise. First, that the Federal
                            Republic was not enthusiastic about dividing up national packages.<note

                            Second, he felt that it was not advisable to give up sea-based systems.
                            These were a means of cementing solidarity for taking risks among the
                            Allies. (C)</p>
                        <p>In response, <hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski</hi> pointed out the

                        <p>Cy and I have expressed our concerns to our FRG counterparts over
                            Chancellor Schmidt’s recent action in holding the projected real growth
                            in Bonn’s 1980 defense budget to only 1.6%.<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2"
                                >Telegram 15779 from Bonn, September 6, reported that at a September
                                4 press conference, Apel stated “that the FRG would probably not
                                meet the NATO-agreed goal of a three percent real increase in its
                                1980 defense budget; the real increase was likely to be between 1.5
                                and 1.6 percent. He said there would be no negative effect on
                                Alliance defense, since in the area of hardware procurement there
                                would be in 1980 a seven percent increase, which would be ‘clearly
                                above a three percent real increase’ in the procurement area.
                                Therefore, he said, there was ‘no central problem’ as regards the
                                FRG defense budget.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign
                                Policy File, D790407–0203) Telegram 236633 to Bonn, September 9,
                                conveyed Vance’s message to Genscher, including the danger that
                                reduced growth in the German defense budget might “have negative
                                implications in the debate in the United States concerning
                                ratification of the SALT II Treaty and our efforts to increase
                                expenditures for defense modernization.” (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D790412–0706)</note> Aside from being
                            inconsistent with the FRG pledges to 3%, it will seriously impede Bonn’s
                            ability to carry out the NATO Long Term Defense Program (LTDP).
                            Moreover, if NATO’s second biggest defense contributor does not meet its
                            3% pledge, it could very well become the signal for similar actions by
                            less wealthy Allies, thus undermining your NATO initiatives package just
                            when the need for them is becoming crystal clear.</p>
                        <p>When I raised this matter with Defense Minister Apel,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d120fn3">According to telegram 236633 from Bonn, September 9
                                (see <ref target="#d120fn2">footnote 2</ref>, above), Brown
                                telephoned Apel to discuss the FRG defense budget.</note> he noted
                            that there is a possibility of a later increase for 1980 which would
                            bring the growth in FRG defense spending close to 3%. The increase would
                            be for increased costs of fuel, exercises, etc.—as is the case for our
                            own proposed amendment. There are signs that Schmidt is leaving room for
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Since Schmidt himself will have to decide this issue, I suggest that at
                            some early date you express to him your own concern over how such FRG
                            action could undermine NATO’s defense buildup, including your own
                            attempt to get 3% real growth from Congress. Instead of a special call
                            devoted primarily to this subject, you might mention it when you are
                            talking with Schmidt on some other matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d120fn4"
                                >On September 18, Carter wrote a handwritten letter to Schmidt based
                                on a Department of Defense draft, that read: “We are striving
                                mightily here to honor our 3% real growth commitment in the defense
                                budget. With our higher inflation rate, it is very difficult for us
                                but I believe we can prevail. I hope you can do the same. The
                                maintenance of a firm resolve in NATO with the theater nuclear force
                                and defense commitments will, in my opinion, be crucial to our
                                future ability to preserve peace through a proper East-West balance
                                of strength and its attendant mutual respect. Best personal wishes!
                                Stay in touch with me as we address these most important issues.
                                Jimmy.” Carter sent copies of the letter to Vance, Brown, and
                                Brzezinski. (Memorandum from Brown to Carter, September 14; Carter

                        <p>Of course, if you take the actions I have proposed with respect to our
                            own 3% real defense growth, you’ll be in a strong position to urge the
                            same on Schmidt. I might add that Paris has just announced its own
                            proposed 1980 budget, which calls for 3.5% real growth, and that the new
                            UK government is standing firm on 3% too.<note n="5" xml:id="d120fn5"

                            <item>(C) On the evening of October 12, the FRG press spokesman, Klaus
                                Boelling, told the Public Affairs Counselor that Chancellor Schmidt
                                was very angry over press reports that the Minister President of
                                Lower Saxony, Hans Albrecht (CDU), had received a “mission” from
                                National Security Adviser Brzezinski during Albrecht’s recent visit
                                to Washington.<note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5">No memorandum of
                                    conversation has been found for Brzezinski’s meeting with
                                    Albrecht. Telegram 273768 to Bonn, October 19, reported on
                                    Albrecht’s October 12 meetings with Christopher, Newsom, Smith,
                                    and Vest. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy
                                    File, D790480–1130)</note> Based on Albrecht’s comments, the
                                press stories claimed that Dr. Brzezinski had told Albrecht that he
                                (Albrecht) should make it his “mission” to keep the German
                                Government from dodging its commitment to achieve a three percent
                                real increase in its defense budget. Boelling said he had rarely
                                known the Chancellor to become as angry as he was over these
                                reports.</item>

                            <item>(C) Boelling said that it was, of course, the Chancellor’s view
                                that to give a message to a government via its opposition would be
                                an incorrect way to carry out diplomacy, particularly among allies.
                                Boelling pointed out that Albrecht was “not the German Foreign
                                Minister.”</item>

                            <item>(C) Boelling went on to say that he had the Chancellor’s approval
                                to make the government’s displeasure with these stories known.
                                (Boelling later did this on background with a small circle of
                                journalists.)</item>

                                the Schmidt government about Albrecht’s version of Dr. Brzezinski’s
                                remarks is that they gave the impression the Chancellor was not
                                capable of being trusted with the situation and that Dr. Brzezinski
                                appeared to think a CDU politician would do a better job of pressing
                                for additional defense funds.</item>

                                    Stoessel reported that on September 27, he had briefly discussed
                                    the defense budget with Apel. Stoessel reported that Apel
                                    “regretted that the media had played up the problem to the
                                    extent that it had, and particularly the distorted version given
                                    by the press of Secretary Brown’s letter to him. The press
                                    pictured the letter as having been threatening in tone and
                                    ‘waving a big stick at the FRG.’ Nothing could be further from
                                    the truth, Apel said, but nevertheless the press play would make
                                    it much more difficult for him in his efforts to redress the
                                    situation. If the budget is now increased, it will be made to
                                    appear that the FRG has caved in to US pressure, and Apel said
                                    he was uncomfortable at this prospect.” (National Archives, RG

                                Albrecht stories have now provided dramatic evidence of this
                                situation and Washington might wish to keep this factor in mind as
                                it deals with Germans. In addition, since the Embassy expects to
                                receive questions from the public media on the Albrecht stories, we
                                would appreciate Washington guidance on an appropriate
                                    response.<note n="8" xml:id="d122fn8">In an October 18 message
                                    to Brzezinski and Aaron on his meetings in Bonn, Blackwill wrote
                                    on the Albrecht issue: “I hit Klaus Blech hard on this dustup,
                                    stressed it was nonsense that you would have given Albrecht such
                                    a mission as Chancellery could easily have confirmed had it
                                    bothered to call us. Said Schmidt’s outburst was especially
                                    unfortunate at a time when we are approaching TNF denouement
                                    which will require the closest possible US-German cooperation.
                                    Blech replied that the Foreign Ministry had not been consulted
                                    before Boelling’s public statement and that it would be useful
                                    if I made the same points to Chancellery. I will do so October
                                    18.” (Message from Blackwill to Brzezinski and Aaron, October

                            be congratulated for the good job he had done in bringing about a

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> said that there is no problem in

                            Holland. In this connection, the Chancellor asked about the idea floated
                            by David Aaron when he visited in Bonn, which is already unfortunately
                            in the press: i.e., would the President now be willing to say publicly
                            in the next fortnight that he is proposing a unilateral reduction of

                            and effect as a NATO decision and not simply as a unilateral step by the
                            US. It should be part of a maximum effort to maintain the integrity of
                            the TNF program, including the 572 warheads, which should not be lowered
                            by the Dutch or others. He indicated that the US would be ready to
                            consult soon about the tactics for achieving an Alliance consensus.

                            the Chancellor’s point of view, the most important thing is that

                            to preempt moves that the Dutch have in mind. The <hi rend="italic"

                            It would show that not only the East can take unilateral steps and would

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> said he had been deeply impressed
                            by Hua Guofeng during his recent visit to Bonn. He said that based on
                            nine hours of conversations with Hua, he concluded that Hua has a very
                            balanced judgment, with an astonishing knowledge of the complexities of
                            the world. It was important that Hua never said anything about the
                            unavoidability of war, but rather made a good strategic argument about
                            the risk to the Soviets of a two-front war. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >President</hi> said he had not met Hua, who would be in Washington
                            early next year, but noted that the Vice President, Secretary Vance, and
                            Dr. Brzezinski had all been impressed by Hua. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> summarized the conversation by
                            saying that we would consult in Brussels on the response to the Brezhnev
                            letter. The President would get out a letter for all Heads of State
                            describing the unilateral warhead reduction as well as urging that the
                            TNF level of 572 warheads be maintained intact. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> asked about the prospects for SALT
                            ratification. The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> answered that the
                            prospects were difficult. He noted that Senator Byrd had now come out
                            publicly for the Treaty and is working actively with the other Senate
                            members. The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> asked when we expected to
                            see a light at the end of the tunnel. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >President</hi> answered that we expected Senate debate to begin
                            about Thanksgiving. He said we are negotiating with Nunn and other
                            Senators about our defense efforts, on the one hand, and with the
                            McGovern wing, which wants to put restraints on our SALT III position,
                            on the other hand. The negotiations are complex and we have a difficult
                            prospect before us. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> asked whether the debate would be
                            finished this year. The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> answered that
                            this was his hope, but the debate may go past Christmas; the Senate
                            prefers an unlimited debate. In the meantime the administration was
                            trying to keep the doubtful from coming out against the Treaty and so
                            far was successful in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
                            preventing unwanted amendments and reservations. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >President</hi> said that the Chancellor had been very helpful and
                            that he would call on the Chancellor if help was needed in the future.
                            The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> wondered whether any further
                            interventions on his part might be counterproductive. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> closed the conversation by noting
                            that appropriate committees in the Bundestag have unanimously approved
                            the decision that the Alliance will take on TNF modernization and arms
                            control in December. (S)</p>

                                wide-ranging and positive. Both agreed that move toward imposition
                                of UN Chapter VII sanctions against Iran would be logical and would
                                have FRG support. Chancellor said that FRG—on condition that other
                                European countries did likewise—would participate in financial
                                actions along general lines suggested by Presidential emissaries,
                                although he did not think they would be effective.<note n="2"

                                fifteen minutes in Bonn December 11. He reviewed in detail our views
                                of the Iranian situation, including discussion of channels we have
                                been using in attempt to communicate with Iranian authorities, UN

                                have been patient and firm in dealing with the situation but that we

                                the hostages and the expectation of a World Court decision in this
                                sense in the near future, the groundwork has been laid for further
                                action in the UN framework.<note n="5" xml:id="d125fn5">On December

                                find ourselves next week in a situation where the Iranians have
                                totally ignored the views of the world community as expressed by the
                                Security Council and the World Court, then we will have to think of
                                Chapter VII sanctions.<note n="6" xml:id="d125fn6">Reference is to

                                Both he and Genscher said they would support such a move. They
                                inquired about possible Soviet reactions to a call for sanctions and
                                the Secretary said that he had discussed this with Dobrynin before

                                The Secretary had made clear that a Soviet veto would have very
                                serious adverse effects on U.S.–Soviet relations and on the position
                                of the Soviet Union in the world community. In view of the support
                                given by the USSR in the UN Security Council debates to the
                                principle of the inviolability of diplomatic premises, he expected
                                that the Soviet Union would not veto a call for sanctions; perhaps
                                an abstention would be possible, but this would not be a veto. The
                                Secretary said that China would support a call for sanctions. The
                                Chancellor thought that the Soviet Union would wish to influence the
                                exact wording of the call for sanctions and wondered if we had
                                prepared language as yet for an appropriate resolution. The
                                Secretary said we have not reached that stage but would be
                                considering the matter urgently.</item>

                            <item>On the range of economic measures against Iran which had been
                                discussed last week by the Presidential emissaries in the several
                                capitals, the Chancellor said the FRG would be prepared to cooperate
                                on the condition that other countries did so as well. However, he
                                said in all frankness he did not believe these measures would be
                                very effective in exerting pressure on Khomeini. They were rather
                                technical in nature and difficult for most people to understand;
                                moreover, any impact they would have would take some time to be
                                felt. The Chancellor noted that the powers of the FRG Government to
                                compel banking institutions to take such measures are limited but he
                                made clear that the government could exercise influence on the major
                                German banks to induce them to take actions which are deemed
                                necessary and appropriate, but always on the understanding that
                                banks in other European countries would be taking similar
                                action.</item>

                            <item>The Chancellor suggested that the four Allied Foreign Ministers,
                                in their discussions in Brussels the evening of December 12, should
                                also cover the Iranian situation and, in particular,
                                financial/economic measures under consideration. They could then
                                mandate their experts (for example, Cooper for the U.S. and
                                Lautenschlager for the FRG, together with their British and French
                                colleagues) to meet urgently to review options and produce an agreed
                                paper on the range of suggested actions. The Chancellor thought we
                                should ask that such a paper be ready by midday on December 13. The
                                Secretary agreed with this suggested course of action.<note n="8"

                                    Paye, and Lautenschlager to discuss measures to be taken by
                                    major industrial states and economic sanctions that might be
                                    applied in Chapter VII action against Iran. (National Archives,

                                    friends and allies.” Vance noted that Schmidt’s suggestion that

                                    dinner in Brussels was “a particularly constructive one which

                            <item>Genscher and Schmidt both mentioned that they have been giving
                                consideration to what further measures, if any, the European
                                Community might take to promote stability in the Middle East and
                                reassure those countries in the area who are concerned by the events
                                in Iran. They spoke of possibly including Saudi Arabia, the Gulf
                                Emirates, and Iraq in some kind of association with the European
                                Community, although the terms of such an association were not
                                spelled out in any detail. Schmidt thought that a move of this kind
                                could help to give these countries the feeling that they are
                                supported by the West and that this could be helpful in current
                                circumstances. Genscher referred to the association of many of the
                                Mediterranean states with the EC and thought that this possibly
                                could be extended to include some of the key states in the Middle
                                East. Genscher underlined that the FRG had made no decision in this
                                regard and had not talked with other EC member countries; it would
                                not do so until it had received U.S. reactions. Cooper noted that,
                                in the past, we had had some problems with the associated measures
                                worked out by the EC in the Mediterranean area, but he thought these
                                had been resolved. The Secretary said the idea was an interesting
                                one which we would wish to consider in the U.S.; personally, he
                                thought it might well help to promote stability in the Middle East
                                and, on this basis, he would tend to favor the idea.</item>

                            <item>In the context of a discussion of possible military action by the
                                U.S. against Iran, the Chancellor gave it as his view that a sharp
                                reduction or elimination of oil deliveries from Iran would result in
                                a world economic crisis. Third World countries would be affected, as
                                well as industrialized countries, including some in Eastern Europe.
                                Unemployment rates would go up drastically. He thought that oil
                                would simply be unavailable in sufficient quantities to meet demand,
                                regardless of how high the price went. He said that all of this
                                would have to be faced up to and accepted if necessary, but we
                                should do so with our eyes open and the U.S. should ensure that
                                thorough and timely consultation is carried out with other countries
                                before steps are taken which could result in shutting down the flow
                                of Iranian oil.</item>

                                including military. The political situation in Iran was also
                                reviewed, and other subjects which came up briefly included the
                                situation in Egypt, the state of the Shah’s health, and prospects

                                meeting briefly, in particular the decisions concerning theater
                                nuclear force modernization and the proposals for arms control
                                negotiations. They reviewed political problems of the Dutch, Danes
                                and Belgians, but expressed confidence that the Alliance would, in
                                the end, find a way to make the necessary decisions. The Chancellor
                                stressed the need to take a serious attitude—and to make this clear
                                publicly—regarding arms control negotiations with the East.
                                Referring to his recent talks with Gromyko, he mentioned that, in
                                his experience of some ten years of dealing with Gromyko, he had
                                never found him more friendly and forthcoming in private discussion
                                than on the occasion of his last visit to Bonn. The Chancellor said
                                he was convinced that the Soviet Union would wish to pick up the
                                thread before long of the arms control negotiations despite the TNF
                                decisions.</item>

                            <item>The Chancellor inquired about SALT II ratification and said he
                                would be prepared to make another statement early in the new year
                                supporting the treaty, but he did not wish to do so if it would in
                                any way be counter-productive. The Secretary encouraged him to make
                                such a statement.</item>

                            <item>The Chancellor said he was thinking of making a trip to the United
                                States to see the President in the first part of 1980 if this would
                                be acceptable to the President and if the timing could be worked out
                                in the light of the President’s heavy schedule in the election year.
                                He noted that he would be seeing Brezhnev during the first half of
                                1980 and that he felt it would be desirable if he could see
                                President Carter before such a meeting. The Secretary said the
                                Chancellor would be most welcome in Washington and it was left that
                                Embassy Bonn would undertake to work out details of a possible visit

                            Afghanistan. (C)</p>

                            concerns about SALT dissuade us from strong condemnation of the Soviets.

                            York concerning the hostages, we were not the proper ones to take the
                            initiative in the UN on Afghanistan. Concerning Iran, we hoped to get a
                            Security Council vote on our resolution before the end of the year when

                            meeting a headline that would not lead others to shy away from
                            participation. Given the events in Belgium, Holland, and Denmark a few
                            weeks ago, it might be worthwhile to give the session a little different
                            headline. The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> asked what sort of
                            headline, and <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> stressed that for him,
                            calling a meeting explicitly on Afghanistan was okay; he said that other

                                invasion of Afghanistan. Schmidt worries that the application of
                                sanctions against Iran by the Europeans would lead to a suspension
                                of Iranian oil to Europe and cause unprecedented economic problems
                                in the industrialized world. He also fears if we use military force
                                against Iran, it would destroy our efforts to secure the support and
                                trust of the Soviets as exemplified in Afghanistan. Finally, Schmidt
                                wonders if, as after the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the
                                U.S. reaction to Afghanistan will be initially sharp but will fade

                                Genscher that “we understand that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
                                has altered the strategic equation in Southwest Asia, that this has
                                been fully taken into account in our efforts to free the hostages,
                                and that we are prepared to meet the Soviet challenge over the long
                                haul.”</note> The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> asked Genscher to
                            do everything possible to influence the French and others who have not
                            been so forthcoming in response to the crisis in Afghanistan. (S)</p>
                        <p>Stressing that we continued to desire a cooperative relationship with the
                            Soviets, the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> noted that we would pursue
                            SALT, MBFR and attempt to work with Moscow to control the threat to
                            peace. Our communication with the Soviets will be strained in the near
                            term but we will let them know that we want a cooperative relationship,
                            if and when Soviet actions make that possible. (S)</p>
                        <p>In response, <hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> said that in his judgment
                            the Soviets invaded Afghanistan because they wished to prevent that
                            country from leaving their sphere of influence. The FRG believed that
                            Moscow had miscalculated both the reaction of the West to the invasion
                            and the reaction of the Third World. The Soviets had made a similar
                            mistake concerning TNF modernization. They had felt that the TNF
                            decision would not be supported by the European Allies and that they
                            could separate Europe from the United States on the issue. <hi
                                rend="italic">Genscher</hi> said that after Afghanistan, he was sure
                            that the Soviets would try to drive a wedge between Europe and the U.S.
                            For this reason it was imperative that the Allies reach a common
                            understanding and strategy concerning Afghanistan under which each
                            individual Ally could undertake individual tasks. Germany was ready to
                            take the lead in providing economic assistance to Turkey and also could
                            give some help in arms supply since Turkey was a member of NATO. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> continued that the FRG considered it
                            imperative to focus attention on Pakistan. Germany could not provide
                            military assistance but could participate in financial assistance. Bonn
                            had suggested to the EC that it offer political and economic help to the
                            Gulf and to Iraq as had been done with the ASEAN countries. This would
                            be a direct and effective response to Soviet policy in the area. <hi
                                rend="italic">Genscher</hi> noted that we should try to consolidate
                            and stabilize the countries around Afghanistan. He hoped that the
                            leaders in Iran would become aware of where the real danger to that
                            country came from. The FRG would also consider increasing development
                            assistance in Africa to try to help stabilize the situation there.
                            Germany was ready to discuss increased military expenditures if this
                            became necessary and all parties in the Bundestag agreed on this issue.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> said that it was important to see further
                            progress in the Middle East in order to reconcile Sadat with the
                            Rejectionist Front. In sum <hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> stressed, the
                            West should show the Soviet Union not only protests but a counter
                            strategy that made it clear that the next Soviet adventure would bear an
                            even higher risk than Afghanistan. <hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi>
                            thought that we had an opportunity to use Afghanistan to revitalize the
                            West. For instance, after a one-year dispute within the Community over
                            an EC economic relationship with Yugoslavia, last Tuesday<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d127fn6">January 15.</note> the Nine had settled the problem
                            in one hour. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> responded that he thought our
                            reading of the strategic consequences of the Soviet invasion were
                            completely compatible with that of the FRG and that Genscher had made a
                            good analysis of the situation. Noting that the letter from Chancellor
                            Schmidt this morning had indicated the need for improved Allied
                            consultation, the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> asked if Genscher had
                            discussed with Cy Vance the possibility of an early meeting of the
                            Quadripartite Foreign Ministers. Genscher replied that they had been
                            thinking of a meeting after the Islamic Conference January 26–29, and
                            Secretary <hi rend="italic">Vance</hi> added that they were trying to
                            think of the proper camouflage for such a get together. In answer to the
                            President’s question, Secretary <hi rend="italic">Vance</hi> said that
                            the Italians would not be included and <hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi>
                            noted that Prime Minister Cossiga had been particularly helpful recently
                            and the Germans would not mind if the Italians were invited. The <hi
                                rend="italic">President</hi> noted wryly that he thought the Foreign
                            Ministers were devious enough to find an excuse to meet, and asked if
                            the French would be willing to come. <hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi>
                            replied that the French had always been willing to discuss every issue
                            in this group—Yugoslavia, Portugal, Afghanistan, the Middle East—but not
                            in NATO. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> wondered whether an umbrella for the
                            Ministerial meeting might be a pre-planning session for the Economic
                            Summit and <hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> said that would provide a
                            good camouflage. <hi rend="italic">Dr</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Brzezinski</hi> added that would also bring in the Japanese who
                            would have an important role to play in meeting the Soviet challenge.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> then offered the President his warmest
                            congratulations for his victory in Iowa.<note n="7" xml:id="d127fn7"

                                1980, pp. A1, A16)</note> The <hi rend="italic">President</hi>
                            responded that the victory had been unexpected and was due to the good
                            work of Fritz Mondale and Mrs. Carter. He had stayed in the White House.
                            The <hi rend="italic">Vice President</hi> said he had had the glory of
                            explaining to farmers why lower farm prices were good for them. That had
                            been fun the Vice President noted ironically, but the farmers had gotten
                            the message. The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> added that he had
                            carried the farm vote three-to-one and had won every county in Iowa
                            except one. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> then said that it was his conviction that
                            if we explained the Soviet challenge to our citizens, they would
                            understand and be prepared to respond. The West could not allow the
                            Soviets to move ahead step by step without reaction. It was also
                            important that the nonaligned countries realized this and had confidence
                            in Western resolve. They needed to believe that the West would help them
                            in their hour of need since the Soviets were always ready to respond to
                            an invitation. The Soviets had miscalculated twice recently, concerning
                            TNF and in Afghanistan, and it was important that the West give them no
                            reason to miscalculate again. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said that his own assessment, and
                            that of our Ambassador in Moscow, was that moving the Olympics would be
                            a strong lesson to the Soviets.<note n="8" xml:id="d127fn8">On January
                                20, Carter announced that he had asked the President of the U.S.
                                National Olympic Committee not to send the U.S. team to the Summer
                                Olympic Games scheduled to take place in Moscow from July 19 to
                                August 3 if the Soviet Union did not withdraw its troops from
                                Afghanistan within the coming month. See “Letter to the President of
                                the U.S. Olympic Committee on the Games to be Held in Moscow,” <hi
                                    rend="italic">Public Papers: Carter, 1980</hi>, pp.
                                106–107.</note> We were firm in our determination not to go unless
                            the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan. We hope for support in this from
                            the Third World, the Moslem countries and Europe. Australian Prime
                            Minister Fraser had indicated last night his support for our position
                            and Joe Clark had done the same. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said the Soviets would have to
                            realize that in invading Afghanistan they had crossed a very important
                            line. They had to be made to understand that they must pattern their
                            future behavior on acceptable rules of international conduct. Indicating
                            that he thought the Soviets had been surprised by the international
                            reaction to Afghanistan, the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said he
                            did not know how the Soviets could withdraw and save face. In response
                            to the President’s tough message on Afghanistan, Brezhnev had said that
                            Soviet troops were there temporarily and would be removed when the cause
                            of their presence was removed. Thus, Brezhnev seemed to be drawing a
                            distinction between Afghanistan on the one hand and Poland and East
                            Germany on the other. However, even if the Soviets did remove their
                            forces by March or April or May, if they left behind a puppet regime,
                            the Western punishment level should be retained. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> continued that our intelligence
                            indicated that the Soviets were having trouble stamping out the
                            tribesmen and deserters from the Afghan Army. They were not finding it
                            easy to conquer Afghanistan. (S)</p>
                        <p>In closing, the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said that Genscher and
                            Schmidt should not hesitate to call. He thought it would be very useful
                            to proceed rapidly to set up a Four-Power Foreign Ministers meeting. The
                                <hi rend="italic">President</hi> asked Genscher to pass to Schmidt
                            his highest admiration for the Chancellor’s strength and courage. The
                                <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said he understood his freedom to
                            act without adverse consequences was quite different from that of
                            Schmidt because of the vulnerability of West Germany. Therefore,
                            Schmidt’s reaction to the crisis only increased the President’s
                            admiration. <hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> responded that Germany had
                            always given priority to the security aspects of the Alliance. The FRG
                            would discuss the Olympic issue with its EC partners. But it was
                            necessary to avoid creating the impression in Western publics that the
                            Olympic question was the central Western response to the invasion of
                            Afghanistan. Other longer-term measures were also very important. The
                                <hi rend="italic">President</hi> agreed. (S)</p>

                            already are again writing, at least in some German and some American
                            newspapers, I have the feeling that the relationship is functioning well

                            than recently. What you have done and what your country and government
                            have done I think has been extremely courageous, because you are in a

                                with the other EC members. (Telegram 1017 from Bonn, January 17;

                        <p>I know you agree with me that our actions should make it clear to Soviet
                            leaders that they must pay a price for invading Afghanistan and
                            encourage them to withdraw their forces. We can do much to help deter
                            them from further aggression, to contribute to the security and
                            stability of Southwest Asia and the Persian Gulf, and to improve Western
                            relations with the crucial states in that area. It is also very
                            important to remove from Soviet expectations any hope that they can
                            drive a wedge between the Western Allies with a so-called “peace
                            offensive” aimed at any of us.</p>
                        <p>Our response to the Afghan crisis can also serve as a catalyst for making
                            progress on some of the West’s most pressing problems. One such problem
                            is our defensive capability, which should be enhanced both inside and
                            outside Europe. Another lesson of the current crisis is the need to
                            reduce the industrial world’s dependence on Mideast oil. I know that our
                            two countries will work closely with others at the planned meeting next
                            month to reduce oil consumption and, through the International Energy
                            Technology Group, to devise means for increasing alternative energy
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>Each of us in the West has different assets—economic, military and
                            political—as well as different constraints on our ability to act. We
                            need a thorough exploration of how we can ensure that our policies are
                            complementary and of how we can share the necessary tasks. In this
                            message, I want to give you my thoughts on what steps should be taken
                            next. I am also writing to the leaders of the other countries that
                            participate in the economic summits.<note n="4" xml:id="d129fn4"

                        <p>I agree with you that we need a “division of labor” among the Allies to
                            ensure that each of us makes a maximum contribution to our common
                            effort. You are aware of the punitive bilateral steps the United States
                            has taken, or will take, with respect to the USSR. You are also familiar
                            with our efforts in NATO, and with our initiatives in Southwest Asia
                            itself to respond to the Soviet invasion. My decision to seek a five
                            percent real growth in our 1981 defense budget, despite the economic
                            problems and conflicting pressures we face in the United States, is an
                            example of the type of action I hope our allies also will be prepared to
                                take.<note n="5" xml:id="d129fn5">Reference is to Carter’s Fiscal

                        <p>I understand that you and your colleagues are giving renewed
                            consideration to the possibility of a supplemental appropriation that
                            would bring the real growth in the Federal Republic’s 1980 defense
                            budget above the three percent commitment adopted at the 1978 NATO
                            summit. This increase in spending on the Federal Republic’s defenses, in
                            addition to the military assistance you will provide Turkey, will be a
                            clear demonstration of Allied solidarity.</p>
                        <p>I was very pleased to learn that the Federal Republic plans a substantial
                            increase in its 1980 assistance to Turkey and that you are already
                            taking steps to coordinate Western assistance to Turkey this year. You
                            may be sure that the United States will again make a major contribution,
                            both in economic and military assistance. In our judgment, the other
                            donors should be encouraged to disburse their 1979 pledges as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan also needs a large increase in the economic aid being provided
                            through the consortium. The United States is willing to contribute
                            generously. General Zia has told Dr. Brzezinski and Warren Christopher
                            that he wants to know what increased aid others will provide before
                            making important decisions.<note n="6" xml:id="d129fn6">Telegram 33236

                                D800065–0491)</note> In reviewing possible responses to the present
                            crisis, this effort seems to us a matter of the highest priority. I hope
                            that the Federal Republic will be in a position at least to triple its
                            economic assistance to Pakistan this year.</p>
                        <p>Given Pakistan’s enormous needs and the dangerous situation in the area,
                            and given the fact that the Federal Republic will not be providing
                            Pakistan with arms, we believe that you could make another important
                            contribution to Pakistan’s security by helping to improve its
                            communication and transportation systems.</p>
                        <p>In the case of both Turkey and Pakistan, it is important that the aid be
                            untied, in order to increase its usefulness.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the United States (at some substantial cost to our nation)
                            has already taken significant steps in the economic area designed to
                            demonstrate to the Soviet Union that “business as usual” is impossible
                            in light of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. I hope that the Federal
                            Republic will be able to take some action in its extensive economic
                            relationship with the USSR which would complement United States
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>We continue to believe that a severe restriction of official export
                            guarantees by the Federal Republic and of official export credits by the
                            other major lenders would send a powerful signal of Allied solidarity to
                            the Soviets. As you know, Japan has recently taken action to restrict
                            credits to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>With respect to exports of high-technology items to the Soviet Union, I
                            ask that your authorities not request exceptions in the Coordinating
                            Committee (COCOM) to the embargo on strategic goods and technology
                            destined for the USSR, except in hardship cases or where Western
                            security interests dictate. This “no exceptions” policy to the COCOM
                            list as negotiated in 1979 will mark an important and prudent shift in
                            the Allied approach. As to computers—where I understand the 1976
                            standards are still in effect—I urge that no exceptions be made to those
                            standards until new standards are negotiated.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I believe the list of items covered by the COCOM embargo
                            should be expanded to include technology critical to the modernization
                            and expansion of the Soviet industrial base. Submissions to COCOM for
                            approval of these items would be reviewed case by case, with a
                            presumption against approval. What I have in mind is limited in scope
                            but in my judgment important. We believe that the introduction of
                            Western technology to the Soviet industrial modernization program will
                            lead to a significant improvement in the productivity of those
                            industries, which would directly affect both the quantity and quality of
                            military equipment produced in the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>In the industrial area, neither Alcoa nor Armco will go forward with
                            major projects in the Soviet Union. To preserve the impact of this
                            withdrawal, it is essential that the place of the American companies not
                            be taken by industrial firms elsewhere. I hope we can count on German
                            cooperation in this regard. We are looking into the possible existence
                            of similar situations where we should discourage Western and Japanese
                            companies from bidding on large-scale projects in the Soviet Union for
                            the time being. We will keep you informed. We hope that restraint will
                            be evidenced until we mutually agree that circumstances have
                            changed.</p>
                        <p>You know the importance which is attached to denying the Soviet Union the
                            privilege of hosting the Olympic Games—unless their military forces are
                            immediately withdrawn from Afghanistan. This issue is a difficult and
                            emotional one, and I appreciate the thoughtfulness with which it is
                            being discussed in the Federal Republic. I am gratified by the
                            assurances you gave me on the telephone and repeated to me by Malcolm
                                Fraser.<note n="7" xml:id="d129fn7">For Carter’s meeting with
                                Fraser, see Document 41.</note> To the Soviets, this may be the most
                            significant item of all.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I believe it is important that we move quickly to reach firm
                            agreement on a coordinated plan of action. As you and I discussed, I
                            would welcome any thoughts of yours on these subjects.</p>

                        <p>Summary: At luncheon in Chancellery February 20, Chancellor Schmidt was
                            accompanied by Genscher and von Staden. I was accompanied by Ambassador
                            Stoessel. Two and one-half hour conversation was wide-ranging and
                            extremely frank; exchange was useful in elucidating Chancellor’s
                            concerns about present situation and prospects in connection with
                            Afghanistan situation and highlighted his emphasis on need to understand
                            US conception of overall strategy and aims. He complained with some
                            vigor about several instances where he felt there had been lack of prior
                            consultation by US regarding actions it was taking and on which US
                            expected support from allies; however, he emphasized his firm intention
                            to be supportive of US and he made some suggestions regarding ways to
                            improve consultative procedures. Chancellor strongly emphasized his
                            belief that, however difficult France may seem to be, Giscard will stand
                            with us when chips are down and he suggested continuing efforts to
                            pursue dialogue with French. Chancellor welcomed most warmly my visit
                            and effort to consult with European allies, especially France.
                            Chancellor conveyed his best wishes to President Carter and stressed how
                            much he is looking forward to his talks with him in Washington. End
                                Summary.<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">In his February 26 memorandum
                                (see <ref target="#d130fn1">footnote 1</ref>, above), Brzezinski
                                wrote: “Schmidt’s comments are interesting because they reveal a
                                curious schizophrenia: on the one hand, an exaggerated fear (induced
                                by exaggerated anxiety over our reactions), and on the other hand
                                the view that Soviet failure to withdraw from Afghanistan should be
                                followed by some ‘more direct’ Western pressure, perhaps against
                                Libya or Yemen.”</note></p>
                        <p>Schmidt dispensed with any small talk and at beginning of luncheon
                            launched at once into lengthy exposition of his concerns and views. He
                            said that, for him, the fundamental question related to the philosophy
                            of the US in dealing with the Soviet Union now and in the next few
                            years; he also said the same question applied to our views on Southwest
                            Asia, China and East-West relations as a whole. As background to these
                            questions, he said his impression was that, within a matter of months we
                            could be in a phase of escalation of tension between East and West.
                            Perhaps this was inevitable, but he wondered if we really intended to
                            have such an escalation. The Chancellor said he had been puzzled by the
                            phrase in the President’s most recent letter concerning ‘‘punishment” of
                            the Soviet Union.<note n="4" xml:id="d130fn4">Reference is apparently to
                                Document 196.</note> Is it really our goal to punish the Soviet
                            Union and, if so, what do we wish to achieve?</p>
                        <p>Continuing, the Chancellor acknowledged that he had certain domestic
                            problems, as Giscard does and other governments in Europe. Just as
                            President Carter, he also has a political campaign to conduct. He
                            understood that much of what the President says and does has something
                            to do with the domestic situation in the United States and with the
                            political campaign. In an aside, he remarked that this was no doubt the
                            reason that the President was not fulfilling the pledge he made at Tokyo
                            to bring US oil prices up to the world market level in 1980.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d130fn5">In this sentence, Carter underlined the words “he
                                made at Tokyo” and wrote in the margin: “It was Bonn. I corrected
                                our goal before Tokyo.”</note> The Chancellor said that he and other
                            members of his government have refrained from making statements
                            concerning the present situation which would cater to the interests of
                            the political campaign under way in the FRG. He wants to continue to put
                            politics to one side, but this would be a difficult position to maintain
                            if he does not understand the philosophy behind US policies. He said
                            that he has a clear feeling that danger is building up. The Chancellor
                            said he wanted to be frank in what he told the Germans about what is
                            going on, but to do so he must know our overall concepts. For example,
                            do we want to embark on a new arms race? Do we wish to punish a world
                            power and for what reasons?</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then spoke about French policy and Giscard. He urged that
                            we should not let our attitude toward France be influenced by the public
                            media. After reviewing briefly his last meeting with Giscard, the
                            Chancellor said there was not the slightest doubt that, if the chips
                            were down, the French would stand firmly with the US just as they had
                            done during the Cuban missile crisis. However, this is not appreciated
                            by the press, which tends to carry “disastrous” reports about French
                            policies. The Chancellor recalled that, in his private meeting with
                            Giscard, he had made a remark—partly intended to flatter Giscard—that
                            for obvious reasons the US was the FRG’s most important ally and that
                            France, for obvious reasons, was the FRG’s closest ally. Schmidt said he
                            wanted the President to understand this and that he did not wish to hide
                            the fact that he had made such a remark. He emphasized that any attempt
                            to divide France and Germany would be most unwise—and this held also for
                            the issue of the Olympic Games.<note n="6" xml:id="d130fn6">In this
                                sentence, Carter underlined the words “also for the issue of the
                                Olympic games.”</note> Schmidt said that he wou1d not allow the
                            Soviets to drive a wedge between the FRG and the US and he stated that
                            Giscard feels exactly the same way about his relations with the US.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt said that we should not worry too much about the FRG–France
                            tete-a-tetes, since this is the only way the French can be carried along
                            with the main stream of European thought. Only the FRG can perform this
                            role. The US cannot do this. As an afterthought, Schmidt remarked that
                            he hoped the UK would not break up Europe because of disputes over the
                            EC budget.</p>
                        <p>Recalling the events of the past five weeks, the Chancellor said that he
                            had to state frankly that he had not understood some of the US actions.
                            Moreover, on several occasions the US had taken decisions on its own and
                            then had expected the allies to say “me too” within 24 hours. As an
                            example, he mentioned the US position regarding a boycott or
                            postponement of the Olympic Games. He had been assured by Warren
                            Christopher (and von Staden had also been assured by Brzezinski) shortly
                            before his policy statement to the Bundestag January 17 that the US
                            would not make a decision in the near future regarding the
                                Olympics.<note n="7" xml:id="d130fn7">Reference is apparently to
                                Christopher’s January 16 talk with Schmidt in Bonn and Brzezinski’s

                                colleagues in Paris. Telegram 915 from Bonn, January 16, reported on
                                Christopher’s January 16 consultations in Bonn. (National Archives,

                            said nothing about the subject in his statement. He subsequently was
                            informed on Sunday morning that the President would announce that
                            evening his decision concerning the boycott or postponement of the
                                Olympics.<note n="8" xml:id="d130fn8">On January 20, Stoessel
                                informed Von Staden that during that evening’s “Meet the Press”

                                if Soviet troops did not withdraw from Afghanistan in a month. In
                                response, Von Staden said that he personally regretted the lack of
                                consultation “in rather strong terms” and noted: “Based on his own
                                contacts with US officials in Washington in the last few days, on
                                Deputy Secretary Christopher’s consultations in Bonn and on
                                Secretary’s statement last week on TV, von Staden said he—as well as
                                the Chancellor—had felt that a US decision on the Olympics was not
                                imminent and, in any event, would be taken only after prior
                                consultation with Allies.” (Telegram 15459 to all diplomatic posts

                                P870104–0210)</note> The Chancellor said this was all in the past
                            but he mentioned it only as an example of how a lack of prior
                            information regarding US intentions could make matters difficult for
                            others.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the US hostages in Iran, Schmidt said he deeply admired the
                            manner in which the President had handled this extremely difficult
                            situation. He could understand some of the pressures the President had
                            been under because of the FRG’s own—and much briefer—experience with the
                            taking of hostages. With all of his admiration for the President’s
                            policy, he had to admit, however, that he had not liked everything we
                            had suggested concerning Iran, especially the idea of mining Iranian
                            ports.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor inquired about the scenario leading, hopefully, to the
                            release of the hostages in Iran and I outlined to him the various steps
                            which are under way.</p>
                        <p>Turning to East-West relations, the Chancellor said that over the past
                            ten years he felt the FRG had not done badly. His approach has always
                            been that of maintaining a balance in Europe, by striving for a
                            reciprocal limitation of arms or, failing achievement of this aim,
                            having enough military strength in the West to deter the Soviets. Only
                            by maintaining this policy can detente proceed. The Chancellor noted
                            that much has been attained through detente, especially for Germany.
                            Many persons of German origin have been able to leave the Soviet Union
                            and Eastern Europe and he did not want to see this process interrupted.
                            Thanks to the help of the US and the other allies, a Berlin agreement
                            was achieved which had brought great benefits; however, if tensions
                            escalate, Berlin could suffer, as well as the 18 million “hostages”
                            constituting the population of the GDR.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt felt that some people in Washington see the present FRG
                            Government as “softies.” This was definitely not the case. After the
                            experience with the neutron bomb issue, it had been hard to get
                            agreement on TNF, but the FRG had rammed it through. In this connection,
                            the Chancellor recalled that, when he had first raised the issue of grey
                            area weapons in 1977, there had been critical statements out of
                            Washington. However, this had changed and, following the Guadeloupe
                            meeting, Germany had taken the lead in Europe in regard to grey area
                            weapons. He thought it should be remembered that, so far as this subject
                            was concerned, the FRG initially had taken a harder stance than the US;
                            moreover, he would note that, on the neutron bomb, the FRG had been
                            ready to go ahead, although the US finally decided not to do so. The
                            Chancellor said the FRG would be as hard as anyone, but he wanted to be
                            sure it was necessary before taking such a stance. One had to be certain
                            that this would not just be to punish someone. As a divided country, the
                            FRG felt particularly vulnerable. It could be that the Soviets would
                            decide to punish the FRG in retaliation rather than the US. Against this
                            background, the Chancellor said he had not been too happy with some of
                            the remarks by Mrs. Thatcher and he preferred the more balanced views of
                            Carrington.</p>
                        <p>As another example of the firm FRG attitude, Schmidt said that the FRG
                            had never interrupted military aid to Turkey. They had not been wrong to
                            do so, just as they had not been wrong to advocate consistently the need
                            for supporting Pakistan, despite the nuclear problem in that country.
                            Schmidt acknowledged that this problem existed, but the FRG had felt all
                            along that it would be well to assist Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt lamented that there were too few opportunities between allies to
                            talk directly and confidentially about current problems. Also, he
                            regretted there was not more talk between the US and France. Once again,
                            he praised Giscard as a sound and reliable leader who is certainly far
                            better than any personality in the opposition in France. He agreed that,
                            as a Frenchman, Giscard has particular sensitivities. However, this is
                            something which afflicts all leaders of democracies and he was sure that
                            Giscard just as other allies wished to maintain a stable alliance.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, the Chancellor said that, as we already knew, we could count
                            on the FRG as a partner without any reservations whatsoever. However,
                            such a partner would be more effective if it knew and understood the
                            goals and aims of the US.</p>
                        <p>In response, I said that the President greatly appreciates his
                            conversations and exchanges with the Chancellor, particularly during the
                            difficult period since the taking of the hostages and during the even
                            more difficult period since the Afghanistan invasion. The President
                            greatly values the Chancellor’s views and he understands, as Schmidt had
                            said, that Giscard in a crunch would be with the US and the other
                            allies. There have been irritations with the French and there will
                            undoubtedly be more in the future, but the President knows that Giscard
                            will stand with us when we are pressed. I said that I personally had
                            been irritated by the French attitude toward the suggested multilateral
                            Foreign Ministers’ meeting and the subsequent backgrounding they had
                            given to the press which had been done without prior notice and which
                            had been extremely distorted.<note n="9" xml:id="d130fn9">See footnote
                                2, Document 43.</note> I said I had made my irritation clear to the
                            French, while at the same time emphasizing that this would not affect
                            the basic relationship between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of the Olympics, I said there had been a failure to
                            communicate adequately in advance regarding our decision, although this
                            had been foreshadowed by remarks I had made previously. The lack of
                            sufficient prior consultation was regrettable and must be prevented in
                            the future.<note n="10" xml:id="d130fn10">In the margin next to this

                        <p>As to our philosophy in the light of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
                            I said we saw this as an event of very serious proportions requiring a
                            firm, strong response and one which we would be prepared to sustain. We
                            felt the Soviets must be made to pay a price so long as their troops
                            remain in Afghanistan; also we wished to convey the message that we
                            intended to be firm in order to deter Soviet aggression elsewhere. The
                            Soviet strength in Afghanistan represents a potential threat to Pakistan
                            and Iran, especially if there is fragmentation in the latter
                                country.<note n="11" xml:id="d130fn11">In the margin next to this

                        <p>I said that, in our view, the steps we have taken are both firm and clear
                            and no further major, new steps are required at this point. We believe
                            that we should seek to achieve a return to the <hi rend="italic">status
                                quo ante</hi> in Afghanistan, along the general lines suggested by
                            the recent statement of the EC–9 in their Rome meeting.<note n="12"

                            achieved, our philosophy on East–West relations is that the present
                            sanctions should remain in effect but that we should not try to shut off
                            all dialogue between the US and the Soviet Union or between the other
                            allies and the Soviets. It is essential to maintain arms control
                            discussions. I emphasized that we have not withdrawn the SALT II treaty
                            for ratification but have deferred it. As soon as we feel there is some
                            chance for ratification, we will bring it to the Senate. Hopefully, this
                            could be before our elections, although it might come afterwards.<note

                            Meanwhile, we will take no actions which would violate the SALT II
                            treaty and we expect the Soviets to adopt the same position. I said I
                            had put the question specifically to Gromyko regarding Soviet intentions
                            to abide by SALT II but had received no answer. A Pravda editorial had
                            indicated somewhat ambiguously that the Soviets would continue to
                            observe the treaty provisions.</p>
                        <p>In conversations with Dobrynin, I said agreement had been reached that
                            most of the other negotiations with the Soviets in the arms control
                            field would continue, such as CTB, MBFR, a chemical warfare treaty and a
                            radiological treaty. The Indian Ocean talks have been suspended in view
                            of Afghanistan, which has made it essential for us to maintain a strong
                            naval presence in the area. In general, I said we will continue arms
                            negotiations, which are in our own interests as well as those of our
                            allies. I believed the CSCE process should be kept alive and we planned
                            to attend the Madrid meeting. We also will be prepared to follow up on
                            the French CDE proposal following Madrid.</p>
                        <p>When Schmidt inquired if the Soviets know of these intentions, I
                            responded affirmatively. In another aspect of our policy, about which
                            the Soviets have not been informed, I said it is our intention to
                            maintain and observe formal US–Soviet agreements, such as those covering
                            grain shipments, maritime activities, and civil air. With regard to
                            Eastern Europe, I said we believe it is in our interest and that of our
                            allies to continue to seek good relations with Eastern Europe. I
                            repeated that we feel it is important to maintain a dialogue between the
                            US and the Soviets. Schmidt interjected that the last consideration was
                            the most important.</p>
                        <p>I said I had met three times in recent weeks with Dobrynin and had
                            emphasized our desire to keep alive the basic framework of our
                            relations. We expect that the Soviet troops will be withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt asked if the Soviets understand that no weapons from the West
                            will be sent to the Afghanistan rebels if the Soviets withdraw. I said
                            the Soviets have raised this question and I have responded by saying
                            that I had heard the question but that if there is to be discussion
                            about it, it would be a subject for a talk between Gromyko and myself. I
                            said that, speaking very confidentially, I have written to Gromyko
                            outlining all of our concerns about Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, the Persian
                            Gulf, and so on. I thought the time would come when it would be helpful
                            for me to have a private talk with Gromyko and that, before doing so, I
                            would wish to consult with the Chancellor.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt inquired whether I felt there was a real danger to Yugoslavia in
                            present circumstances. I replied that I did not believe this was the
                            case at this time, but might arise later, and Schmidt agreed.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, I said our philosophy was that the Soviet invasion could not
                            go without a strong response but that we do wish to maintain the overall
                            framework of East-West relations.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he understood I had given Genscher a paper outlining
                            US aims in the current situation.<note n="14" xml:id="d130fn14">Vance’s

                                deterrence, make Soviets pay a price for Afghanistan and prevent
                                their driving wedges among the allies”; “C) maintain pressures to
                                gain Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan”; “D) manage East-West

                            on the basis of the recent talks with the French. He thought we would
                            find it of interest to study the German paper and, thereafter, on the
                            occasion of the Chancellor’s visit to Washington, the two sides could
                            compare views and reactions regarding the papers. (Genscher subsequently
                            gave me a copy of the German paper.)<note n="15" xml:id="d130fn15">The

                        <p>After expressing appreciation for my remarks, the Chancellor said he
                            would like to speak in a broad vein about some of his concerns. Quite
                            frankly, he saw the danger of a third world war occurring in the not too
                            distant future—not immediately but perhaps in 1981.<note n="16"
                                xml:id="d130fn16">In this sentence, Carter underlined the words
                                “third world” and “perhaps in 1981.”</note> Of course, an
                            “explosion” regarding our hostages in Iran could lead to an escalation
                            which could bring the danger of war even sooner. Outlining various
                            possibilities in which he saw the danger of a war developing, Schmidt
                            said this could come over an incident in the Persian Gulf, as he had
                            already mentioned it could result from something to do with the
                            hostages, or it could involve pressures in Berlin. He also thought that
                            any hostilities might become nuclear, particularly given the lack of a
                            strong US military potential in the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt continued that the obsession of the Soviets with China also is a
                            threat. He thought the Soviets probably misread US policy toward China
                            and that it was important for us to explain these policies to them. If
                            the US tries to make the Soviets pay by stimulating their fears of
                            China, this could induce the Soviets to take counter actions which would
                            be dangerous. The Chancellor thought that the situation between China
                            and the West is unclear and could be a cause of war. If China is
                            threatened, this could compel the US to ask—and to answer—the question
                            of whether we would help China or not.</p>
                        <p>Probably the most likely cause of war, the Chancellor thought, would
                            evolve from an increased arms race. From statements made by some US
                            representatives, the impression is given that we wish to see a sharp
                            increase of allied forces in Europe as well as those of the US. How
                            serious all of this is remains unclear to the FRG and it must be even
                            more unclear to the Soviets. In the Chancellor’s view, if by 1981 the
                            Soviets conclude that an arms race is beginning—and they would realize
                            that this is a race they could not hope to win—there is a risk that they
                            would decide to take early preemptive action to strike while they still
                            had an advantage.</p>
                        <p>This line of thought, the Chancellor said, led him to underline the
                            importance of my talking with Gromyko in order to make clear the true
                            nature of US intentions. I said I agreed completely with the Chancellor
                            concerning the dangers inherent in an arms race. This is why I felt it
                            was imperative to obtain ratification of the SALT II treaty so as to
                            prevent a new spiral in the arms competition.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the Afghanistan situation, Schmidt said that, if the Soviets
                            are to leave Afghanistan, they will do so only if a framework is
                            established and if they know that the West will not replace them. A
                            framework probably would have to involve a staged withdrawal. For
                            example, removal of their strategic air capability would reduce the
                            strategic threat to the surrounding area.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor then raised the possibility that the Soviets, despite all
                            of the sanctions taken against them by the West, may simply refuse to
                            pull out of Afghanistan.<note n="17" xml:id="d130fn17">Next to this
                                sentence, Carter wrote: “most likely prospect.”</note> If this
                            transpires, the Soviets will appear to have won and the philosophy of
                            containment will no longer be credible. What should the West do if the
                            Soviets refuse to leave Afghanistan? In Schmidt’s view—and he emphasized
                            he was “thinking out loud”—he thought it would make sense in such a
                            situation to try to push the Soviets out of some other area where they
                            have established a foothold—i.e., Angola, Libya, Ethiopia, or North
                                Yemen.<note n="18" xml:id="d130fn18">In the margin next to this

                            capabilities are greater than they are in far-off Afghanistan and where
                            more direct pressures could be brought to bear. The Chancellor
                            acknowledged that all of this probably sounded very daring and
                            adventuristic, but he urged that consideration be given to what moves
                            might be taken if the Soviets refuse to budge on Afghanistan. If this
                            happens, we must do something in order not to appear impotent.<note

                        <p>I expressed my own confidence that, in time, the Soviets could be induced
                            to leave Afghanistan. On China, I reviewed the development of our
                            relationship with China and the measured pace we were following in
                            pursuing normalization. While in the past we have attempted to be
                            evenhanded in dealing with the Soviets and the Chinese, the Soviets now
                            perceive that there has been a clear tilt by the US toward China. In
                            fact, they may see more than is really there, since there has been a
                            large increase in contacts following a period where virtually no
                            contacts existed. The Soviets are particularly concerned about the
                            strategic relationship between the US and China and how this might
                            translate into such matters as military sales. When it was decided
                            before Secretary Brown’s visit to China that we would permit the sale of
                            non-lethal military equipment to China, the Soviets probably saw this as
                            a first step towards selling lethal weapons to the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>I continued that the Soviets have always been worried about encirclement
                            and these fears are now exacerbated by our contacts with the Chinese.
                            The situation is also being fed by the flux in the Soviet leadership,
                            where we can say that the change is already under way. I agreed that the
                            whole relationship with China presents an area of great danger—when I
                            see Gromyko I will talk to him about this and assure him that we are not
                            trying to encircle the Soviet Union and will not sell lethal weapons to
                            the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt picked up my remark about change in the leadership in the Soviet
                            Union, and asked what our views were. I said that Kosygin seems to be
                            totally out of the picture while Brezhnev apparently is experiencing
                            more periods of down than up.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt inquired if it would cause problems for us if he were to stress
                            in public the deisrability of contacts between the two super powers. I
                            said I thought there would be no objection if this idea were stated in
                            general terms.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt inquired if the US had proposed officially to the Soviets that
                            negotiations begin on TNF. I said this had been done but that the
                            Soviets had turned the suggestion down.<note n="20" xml:id="d130fn20">In
                                the margin next to this and the preceding sentence, Carter wrote:
                                “He knew this.”</note> Schmidt thought it would be helpful if I
                            could mention in a speech that we had made the suggestion for such
                            negotiations. I said this would pose no difficulties. When Schmidt
                            inquired if I felt the Soviets would stick to their negative stance on
                            TNF negotiations, I said I thought they would do so for some time but
                            eventually they would probably move from this position. Schmidt
                            commented that the recent Gierek speech and proposal for a disarmament
                            conference might indicate a certain erosion in the Soviet position.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt inquired if, in our contacts with the Soviets, we had evoked the
                            1973 US–Soviet agreements. I said that this had been done and that the
                            1972 agreement had also been recalled.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt reverted to his concerns about an arms race, saying that if this
                            were to develop the position of the FRG would become extremely
                            difficult, in particular, this would be the case if only the US and the
                            FRG on the Western side were to contribute to the Western buildup. He
                            would not permit the FRG to be singled out among European countries. The
                            FRG, Schmidt said, must remain a NATO partner like the other partners,
                            even if it was stronger economically and militarily than the other
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor went on to speak of the capability of the FRG army, noting
                            that it was based on a conscription system, that good reserves existed,
                            and that mobilization would be expeditious. These were the important
                            things in estimating military capabilities, and not percentage numbers
                            which could be manipulated in various ways. Nevertheless, in order that
                            no wedge could be driven between the FRG and the US, the Chancellor said
                            that the FRG would fulfill the three percent pledge and that he would
                            tell the President this when he saw him in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt then dwelt on the risks assumed by the FRG in regard to the
                            stationing of a large number of nuclear weapons in a small and heavily
                            populated area. He could only hope that the US public could understand
                            this situation and the risks accepted by the FRG in this connection. At
                            this point the Chancellor spoke with some vehemence about his dislike of
                            criticisms from US officials (he mentioned Bob Komer by name in this
                            context) regarding the FRG military contribution.<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d130fn21">Reference is apparently to Komer’s February 9
                                speech at a Munich conference on European security problems.

                            up” with them.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor was also irritated by allegations that he is somehow in
                            the hands of the left wing of the SPD. He said in strong terms that the
                            SPD was in his hands and would remain so long as he was the Chancellor.
                            If Strauss were to win—which Schmidt did not anticipate—then the nature
                            of the SPD might change. This was one reason why the Chancellor intended
                            to stay in power. He reiterated that, so long as he was there, he would
                            control the party.</p>
                        <p>In a discussion of sanctions against Iran, Schmidt said he had agreed to
                            go along with them in the past even though he had not felt them to be
                                correct.<note n="22" xml:id="d130fn22">In the margin next to this
                                sentence, Carter drew an arrow.</note> I explained why we felt the
                            threat of sanctions had been useful in persuading the Iranians to adopt
                            a more moderate stance on the hostage issue. The Chancellor said he
                            would not argue with this in principle but that he also had some of the
                            same reluctance about sanctions against the Soviet Union as he had felt
                            about sanctions against Iran.<note n="23" xml:id="d130fn23">In the
                                margin next to this sentence, Carter drew an arrow.</note> For
                            political reasons, the FRG has built up its exchanges with the Soviet
                            Union and he noted that FRG trade with the Soviet Union was five times
                            more important to the FRG than US trade with the USSR.<note n="24"
                                xml:id="d130fn24">In this sentence, Carter underlined the words “For
                                political reasons,” and wrote in the margin: “for DMarks
                                also?”</note> Such trade also contributed to FRG employment, and the
                            Chancellor said he would be reluctant to see unemployment rise in the
                            FRG because of sanctions against the Soviet Union. He thought it was
                            wrong to ask what the FRG and others should sacrifice in relation to the
                            Soviet Union.<note n="25" xml:id="d130fn25">Carter underlined this
                                sentence and wrote an exclamation point in the margin.</note> What
                            the FRG wishes to do is contribute to a constructive policy. If it
                            appears that sacrifices really are required by the situation, then they
                            would be accepted, but this should not be done in response to pressure
                            from the public media in the US and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>I said I wished to refer to one more issue, that of the Middle Eastern
                            negotiations and the Arab–Israeli dispute. The US fully recognizes the
                            importance of resolving these issues if we were to have a stable
                            situation in the Middle East. Progress is slow but there is hope for a
                            favorable outcome. I noted the interest on the part of some of our
                            Allies in coming forward with a new proposal in the UN relating to the
                            Middle East problem. In our view, such an initiative at the present time
                            would be premature and could hinder the ongoing discussions. It is
                            possible that, after the target date for the Autonomy Agreement has
                            passed, an initiative or a new statement might be useful, but I
                            emphasized that for the moment this would not be desirable. Meanwhile,
                            the statements by individual countries relating to the fundamental
                            importance of settling the Middle East problem could be useful.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt said he assumed that we were putting all possible pressure on
                            Begin to move forward and to meet the target date. I said this indeed
                            was the case and that support from others would be helpful in this
                            regard. Schmidt said that, because of German history, there were limits
                            on what the FRG could do. He remarked that it is clear that many of the
                            Arab countries seem to feel that a solution of the Palestinian problem
                            is more important than the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>Regarding assistance to Turkey, the Chancellor said he hoped to see a <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> achieved between Turkey and Greece
                            concerning the Aegean. In the course of the FRG efforts to lead the
                            assistance program for Turkey, it might be possible to sound out the
                            possibilities for such a solution. Schmidt said that the FRG would wish
                            to stay in close touch with SACEUR in this regard. I welcomed this
                            suggestion, while noting that the prospects for success in connection
                            with SACEUR’s efforts seem to have improved somewhat.</p>
                        <p>Speaking in reflective terms about the position of the President, Schmidt
                            said that clearly the President is now seen as a strong leader. He
                            thought that the President had the prospect of being perceived as well
                            as a wise leader and, hopefully, as a successful leader in resolving the
                            crisis situation with the Soviet Union. Schmidt said it is clear to him
                            that strong emotions have now been built up in the US about the Soviet
                            Union. This may be seen as a positive development, although it is
                            something which needs guidance. Through US contacts and those of other
                            countries, with the Soviet Union, there could be a process leading to a
                            resolution of the present situation of tension. Schmidt hoped that in
                            the period just prior to the US elections in the fall there would not be
                            a competition between the rival candidates as to which one would be the
                            toughest toward the Soviet Union. What is required is leadership in
                            order to ensure the peace and not to lead into a world war.</p>
                        <p>On the question of the Olympics, Schmidt said that, as we knew, the FRG
                            will be on our side in the end, but time is needed to bring the others
                                along.<note n="26" xml:id="d130fn26">In the margin next to this
                                sentence, Carter wrote: “I have a queasy feeling still—.”</note></p>
                        <p>Referring to the question of failure of communication which has plagued
                            us at times in the past, I wondered if a mechanism might be developed to
                            improve the situation. For example, perhaps Assistant Secretary Vest
                            might have weekly talks with Ambassador Hermes in Washington to review
                            matters and Ambassador Stoessel might do the same in Bonn. Schmidt
                            welcomed the idea of regularized consultations, but he thought it would
                            be far preferable if I, myself, could arrange to meet on a regular basis
                            with the UK, French, and FRG Ambassadors in Washington.<note n="27"
                                xml:id="d130fn27">In this sentence, Carter underlined “UK,”
                                “French,” and “FRG,” and wrote in the margin next to the paragraph:
                                “Don’t let them decide whom to invite. Include Italy, Japan,
                                Canada.”</note> This could be done in the office or in my home.
                            Perhaps the Italians could be brought in as well if we felt it
                            advisable, although he cautioned that the Cossiga government might not
                            be around very long. Such an arrangement would provide the opportunity
                            for consultations at a high level and could be extremely useful, if I
                            could find a way to make time in my schedule for such talks. I said I
                            would undertake to do this.</p>
                        <p>Concluding the substantive discussion, I said I felt that all of the
                            important questions had been discussed either with the Foreign Minister
                            or with the Chancellor. For some of them, neither side had answers at
                            the moment but there would be opportunity to study them and further
                            consideration would be given to them when the Chancellor visited
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor expressed his great appreciation to me for my visit to
                            Bonn as well as to the other capitals in Europe. He was particularly
                            pleased that I would be going to Paris, since otherwise it would have
                            made matters very difficult. He asked me to convey his very best regard
                            to the President as well as the gist of the views he had presented.
                            Schmidt said he looked forward with much pleasure to seeing the
                            President in Washington and hoped he would have the opportunity for a
                            good private talk with the President. Schmidt reviewed the membership of
                            his delegation, noting that it would include several top industrialists
                            and trade union members. These individuals did not have to be present in
                            the political meetings but it would be useful if they could be included
                            in the White House dinner. The Chancellor remarked that this was his way

                                Chancellor had been very pleased with his talk the previous day with
                                the Secretary and with the frank and confidential nature of the
                                exchange which had taken place. The Chancellor highly values such
                                talks and wishes there could be more of them.” Stoessel also
                                reported: “According to Von Staden, the Chancellor believes that, in
                                the current circumstances, it would be useful to re-institute a kind
                                of special allied consultative group in Washington and his
                                suggestion was meant in this sense.” (National Archives, RG 59,

                        <p>Comment: While he appeared somewhat tired, the Chancellor was in good
                            form. He was frank and even blunt in many of his comments, although
                            generally constructive in his approach and his desire to look ahead. His
                            remarks about the difficulties caused by perceived gaps in the
                            consultative process underlined his sensitivities on this score. His
                            emphasis on the need for a long-term strategy for the West, his
                            disquisitions on France and the FRG-French relation, his worries about
                            the possibility of war and his desire to defend the FRG record in the
                            security area highlighted his concerns on these points. The talk was
                            useful in permitting Schmidt to air his views and preoccupations on a
                            wide variety of subjects. He repeatedly expressed his pleasure that he
                            will be visiting Washington soon, and it is clear he looks forward with
                            much anticipation to his consultations with the President.</p>

                                    armor.) The rest of the Soviet force would then be withdrawn in

                            initiatives will be sufficient to convince them to do so. This idea
                            could cause us real trouble if the EC continues to push its

                                    crisis is of indirect and not direct interest to the Europeans.
                                    We believe that is wrong. In the end detente and Western

                                Brzezinski’s February 26 meeting with Wischnewski has been found. In
                                his February 26 memorandum to Carter (see footnote 1, Document 197),
                                Brzezinski reported that, during their meeting, Wischnewski “assured
                                me of FRG support on the Olympics but said that it would be
                                impossible for the West Germans to announce it now. He could not
                                indicate when it will be possible to do so. He stressed the
                                vulnerability of the Persian Gulf area and the importance of working
                                together in shoring it up. Finally, he agreed that we need to
                                cooperate closely in developing help for Pakistan.”</note> In
                            response to Schmidt’s observation that Wischnewski was an efficient
                            operator, Brzezinski agreed and said that Mr. Wischnewski had good
                            common sense. Brzezinski liked him. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> responded that Wischnewski was a
                            “political friend” in Germany. He would be coming to the United States
                            again around the time of the national political conventions. Schmidt
                            said that anything Dr. Brzezinski told Wischnewski would get immediately
                            back to the Chancellor. Brzezinski, Schmidt said, could be more open
                            than with some German politicians. <hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi>
                            wryly noted that with some Germans, he had spoken too openly. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> then said that he wanted to make a point
                            concerning detente. He said Brzezinski and the Americans should not put
                            a label on Schmidt and the Germans as mindlessly following detente.
                            Schmidt much preferred stessing the importance of a military equilibrium
                            on which detente must be based. Although it was now more important than
                            ever because of the Afghanistan invasion to stress that prerequisite for
                            detente, Schmidt noted that he had written a book called “The Strategy
                            of Balance” ten years ago which developed this theme. Schmidt said it
                            had been his strategy for 20 years. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> continued that he was still in favor of
                            detente and cooperation with the East, not least because of the effect
                            on Eastern Europe. For the Poles, Hungarians, and East Germans,
                            East–West confrontation would be deadly. They needed detente to maintain
                            their limited amount of freedom from Soviet oppression. This was even
                            true of the Bulgarians, but Schmidt repeated that detente could only be
                            sustained if his prerequisite of military equilibrium was maintained.

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> said that he agreed with the
                            Chancellor’s comments and that Eastern Europe should be insulated
                            against some of the current tension. Detente would have to be based on
                            military equilibrium, but the Soviets not only had to show restraint in
                            the acquisition of military means but also in their actions. At the
                            moment, the Soviets were upsetting the equilibrium in means and their
                            actions were also contributing to international disequilibrium. (s)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> agreed and said this trend had started
                            with Angola when the first Cuban foot had been put on African shores. It
                            had now expanded to other places, but was not prevalent in Europe except
                            for the problems of the SS–20 and BACKFIRE—problems, incidentally, that
                            the previous administration did not take seriously enough. Schmidt said
                            that it was only with respect to these weapons that he detected any
                            Soviet tendency to try to tilt the balance in Europe. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> replied that in reaction to the Soviet
                            invasion of Afghanistan, we must avoid a situation in which the
                            Europeans practiced competitive detente, each approaching the Soviets
                            with different solutions to the Afghan problem. Such European
                            initiatives would be divisive in the West and ineffective because the
                            Soviets had probably not reached the stage where they would consider
                            such proposals seriously. They would only use them as propaganda devices
                            and to drive wedges among us. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> then stated that he wanted to ask two very
                            frank questions: (1) Was it possible to maneuver the Soviets out of
                            Afghanistan; and (2) was that the American objective? Schmidt said he
                            thought the answer to the first question was possibly, but had doubts
                            that such a result was really the U.S. aim. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> replied that we were leaving the door
                            open to a solution through which the Soviets could withdraw from
                            Afghanistan. But it was important for the West not to push too hard now
                            with such ideas. If we did, this would make it easier for the Soviets to
                            follow their present strategy of fighting and talking at the same time.
                            The Soviet strategy seems to be to consolidate its position in
                            Afghanistan while defusing external criticism through public discussion
                            of neutrality. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> said that the Soviets might accept
                            neutralization of Afghanistan if three preconditions were sustained: (1)
                            Western unity in rhetoric and action which made Moscow feel that there
                            was a cost for the invasion in East–West relations; (2) Islamic outrage
                            which demonstrated to the Soviets that they were seriously damaging
                            their relationship with the 700 million Moslems from Rabat to Djakarta
                            who were reentering history; and (3) continued Afghan resistance through
                            which (1) and (2) above remained possible. If these conditions were
                            maintained for six months, the Soviet leaders might conclude that a
                            neutrality solution was their most preferable option. But, Brzezinski
                            continued, Moscow would not reach such a view until after it had
                            launched its massive spring offensive against the Afghan resistance.
                            Brzezinski stressed that the U.S. certainly wanted to give the Soviets
                            the opportunity to leave Afghanistan if they decided to do so. But if
                            the Afghan resistance died, we would have a repeat of the 1968 invasion
                            of Czechoslovakia and the West would forget very quickly. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> then observed that imposing neutrality on
                            countries was not an agreeable act in the Third World. The FRG would not
                            have endorsed the EC neutralization proposal if it had not come from the
                            British. But since Carrington had pushed the idea very hard, Schmidt had
                            welcomed the opportunity to come to some joint EC agreement on the
                            problem. But he far preferred that Afghanistan’s neighbors give
                            guarantees of that country’s territorial integrity, self-determination
                            and sovereignty. (S)</p>
                        <p>In response to Brzezinski’s question concerning who would govern
                            Afghanistan in such a situation, <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> said
                            that he was not sure but it would have to be without Soviet presence.
                                <hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> replied that if the Soviets
                            withdrew, there was a real probability that the resulting Afghan
                            government would be strongly anti-Soviet. The problem was to try to
                            create a situation in which the government the Soviets left behind would
                            not be rabidly against them, but that result would be very difficult to
                            obtain. Brzezinski said that he had raised with the Pakistanis and
                            Saudis the possibility of an Islamic military force
                            (Algerians/Syrians/Iraqis/Indonesians/perhaps Pakistanis) who would
                            maintain the balance in Afghanistan after Soviet withdrawal under the
                            green flag. This force might be able to ensure that there would not be a
                            strong anti-Soviet reaction but the depth of feeling on the part of the
                            Afghans would make this difficult too. (S)</p>
                        <p>In any event the West was making a mistake in creating the impression
                            that neutrality was possible soon. There was too much premature
                            speculation about neutrality when the Soviets were massacring Moslems in
                            Afghanistan, perhaps in some cases through the use of chemical weapons.
                            Hundreds of Afghans had been killed in the last few days and that would
                            grow into the thousands. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> responded that the idea of creating an
                            Islamic military force or maintaining concerted Islamic political
                            pressure on the Soviets would, as regards the Arabs, necessitate a
                            solution to the Palestinian problem. Schmidt had mentioned to Vance the
                            desirability of getting together Western experts to analyze the domestic
                            situations in Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Sudan, Oman, Somalia,
                            and perhaps Algeria. The idea would be to analyze what kinds of Western
                            presence these countries could absorb. Schmidt believed that none of
                            these governments would dare accept foreign military bases on their
                            soil; only Israel and Egypt would agree to that, and it would be
                            counterproductive. <hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> agreed to the last
                            point. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> continued that many Arabs believed that
                            the U.S. was a greater enemy than the USSR because of the Palestinian
                            problem. For this reason Schmidt had welcomed the McHenry Security
                            Council speech and vote which had been taken back 24 hours later.<note

                                subsequently disavowed. (Bernard D. Nossiter, “U.S. Votes at U.N. to

                            Saudis gave the impression of more preoccupation with the Palestinian
                            problem than Afghanistan. So Schmidt was not just talking about people
                            like the madman in Libya. For the Arabs, the danger of Israeli expansion
                            and settlement and the specter of Zionism were a more clear and present
                            danger than the Soviets. It was therefore doubtful that a sustained
                            Islamic effort against the Soviets could be maintained without progress
                            on the Palestinian problem. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> said he basically agreed with the
                            Chancellor’s analysis and had talked about this problem with the
                            Algerians, Saudis and Paks during his visits to those countries. But
                            what solution could one think of this year? We could not now promise the
                            Palestinians a nation state, but we could promise a process that moved
                            them toward their goal even if we could not endorse it. Autonomy would
                            create a structure and history would judge how they used it to further
                            their own ends. But, Brzezinski continued, as the Chancellor knew this
                            was mainly a domestic problem for us. The Europeans could be helpful by
                            always remaining a little ahead of the U.S. on the Palestinian question.
                            In response to the Chancellor’s comment that the events surrounding last
                            weekend’s Security Council vote hurt, Brzezinski noted they were
                            extremely damaging. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> next said he wanted to talk about India.
                            There were 900 million Indians and their leader was a lady who was
                            hostile to the United States, to the FRG and to the West. <hi

                            establish a serious dialogue with Mrs. Gandhi. Despite the press’s
                            preoccupation with Clifford’s remark on war, his mission and the talks
                            with Mrs. Gandhi had gone quite well.<note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4"

                            Gonsalves the other day and it was Brzezinski’s impression that the
                            Indians now realized that Mrs. Gandhi’s first comments after the Afghan
                            invasion were a mistake—that she had given too much absolution to the
                            Soviets. The Indians now seemed to realize that they had a stake in
                            Pakistan not disintegrating. We wanted to convince Mrs. Gandhi that
                            while we wished to stabilize Pakistan, we did not wish to strengthen it
                            to a degree that would lead to conflict with India. We would not give
                            the Paks military equipment they could use against India such as
                            advanced aircraft. In response to Schmidt’s question of whether it would
                            be possible to convince the Pakistanis to move some forces from the
                            Eastern to the Western front, Brzezinski said that was difficult because
                            after all Indian forces too were mobilized on Pakistan’s Eastern border.
                            We were also encouraging the Chinese to be more moderate in their
                            relations with India and they seemed to be moving in that direction. <hi
                                rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> observed that the Chinese had presumably
                            concluded that a totally pro-Soviet India was certainly not in their
                            interest. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> then asked about the U.S. China policy as
                            a whole. Brzezinski stressed that we were not designing our Chinese
                            policy primarily as an anti-Soviet tactic. We were interested in good
                            relations with the Chinese quite apart from the Soviet angle. There were
                            several reasons for this: (1) trade; (2) our desire that China serve as
                            a stable factor in the Far East which would help maintain the present
                            equilibrium there; as well as China’s global opposition to Soviet and
                            Cuban activities; and the 44 Soviet divisions that were tied down on the
                            Chinese border. Nevertheless, we would not move rapidly to rapprochement
                            with the Chinese. We recognized that China would like to use us against
                            the Russians and that the Russians are extremely sensitive to our
                            relationship with Beijing. We did not want to needlessly irritate
                            Moscow. At the same time, the Soviets must recognize that if they were
                            insensitive to our concerns it could have an effect on our relationship
                            with China. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> observed that this would mean that from
                            the Soviet perception not only could they not be sure about U.S. policy
                            toward Moscow; they would also interpret Washington’s pro-China policy
                            as clearly anti-Soviet. Moscow no doubt tended to overemphasize the
                            Chinese element in U.S. Soviet policy and it could bring a Soviet
                            preemptive attack on China. Indeed, Schmidt stressed, he thought a great
                            danger in 1981 was Soviet punitive military action against the People’s
                            Republic. He thought this was a clear option for the Soviets. If it
                            happened, Schmidt said, this would give the U.S. a horrible choice:
                            either ignite World War III or let the Russians get away with an
                            enormous gain in prestige. The same loss in prestige would occur if
                            Moscow got away with invading Afghanistan as it had gotten away with
                            Angola, Ethiopia, South Yemen and Libya. (S)</p>
                        <p>Noting that what the Chancellor had said was terribly important, <hi
                                rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> emphasized that this was why we had
                            avoided some actions in our China policy such as selling arms to
                            Beijing. But we were not prepared to abnormally limit our relations with
                            China because of irrational Soviet sensitivities. On the question of a
                            preemptive strike, perhaps the Chancellor was right. But Soviet
                            leadership would have to be very cautious because it could mean the end
                            of the Soviet Union. There were several scenarios: a limited attack
                            which the Chinese could absorb; a large-scale attack which would lead to
                            Chinese defense in depth and heavy Soviet casualties; or a nuclear
                            strike. If the Soviets took the latter action, they could inflict
                            horrendous losses on the Chinese but it would be a historically
                            calamitous decision. Moscow could not be certain what we would do. But
                            even if we did not react in such a scenario, the Soviets would lose
                            every single major Soviet Far East city to a Chinese second-strike
                            nuclear attack which might even reach Moscow. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> said he believed the first of Dr.
                            Brzezinski’s three alternatives was the more likely and Brzezinski
                            replied that it would also be the least effective. Schmidt was not
                            convinced and thought that if the Soviets indicated they were attacking
                            for limited aims and for a limited period, a situation on the model of
                            China’s invasion of Vietnam was thinkable. This too would put the U.S.
                            in an extremely difficult position. Schmidt summed up by saying his fear
                            was that the U.S. China policy was adding to the Soviet obsession with
                            China and with being encircled, without giving the security assurance to
                            the Chinese that they are so longing for. In other words, the worst of
                            both worlds. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> replied that we did not intend to go
                            much further in the near future in our relations with Beijing. At the
                            same time, however, the Soviets were in danger of repeating the tragic
                            error of Imperial Germany after Bismarck. They too had tried to avoid
                            encirclement but through their own actions—naval
                            buildup/colonialism/railroad construction in the East—they had brought
                            it about. The Soviets too may produce just such a self-fulfilling
                            prophecy. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> said that he was astonished to hear from
                            Cy Vance in Bonn that it might be possible to ratify SALT II this
                            spring. Brzezinski said we would do our best, that he himself was deeply
                            and personally committed to SALT and that we genuinely wished to
                            preserve the arms control element of detente. But the right wing in the
                            U.S. would make that difficult; perhaps the same thing was true in the
                            Federal Republic. In any event, Soviet policy in Afghanistan had been
                            shortsighted, much like Stalin’s blockade in Berlin. It had created a
                            strong Western reaction and a dynamism in our policies which would not
                            otherwise have existed. (S)</p>
                        <p>Returning to Brzezinski’s three pre-conditions for Soviet withdrawal, <hi
                                rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> thought that no Soviet peace offensive
                            would be effective, that the Soviets could not drive wedges among us.
                            The danger, Schmidt stressed, was in the West itself; the Soviets could
                            not create it. Schmidt noted that there simply was not sufficient
                            cooperation or collaboration among the Allies. There were different
                            reasons for this but they added up to this one simple fact; from
                            December to February, there was not enough consultation. <hi
                                rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> said the Chancellor was absolutely
                            right. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> continued that often the U.S. did not
                            appear to have time enough to ask its Allies their opinion before it
                            acted. This gave the Europeans the feeling that we did not care what
                            Europe thought. Schmidt said that even if we did not wish to really
                            consult, we had to create the impression of consultation. This
                            face-saving was critical for the French and for the Germans. It was of
                            enormous importance and it had not been understood in the U.S. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> repeated that the Chancellor was
                            absolutely right, and that he had been thinking how we could improve
                            consultations. The talks between the Chancellor and the President on the
                            phone were useful as were the meetings of the Foreign Ministers. Also,
                            Vance would be meeting regularly with the ambassadors of the major
                            European countries from now on. Another valuable tool was the
                            quadripartite group made up of Brzezinski, von Staden and their
                            counterparts in Paris and London. <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> thought
                            all these forums were useful but observed that because of Genscher’s
                            sensitivities, this last group must not be used too often. (S)</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of consultation, <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi>
                            observed that the Olympics had not been the only problem. When the
                            Soviet invasion of Afghanistan had begun, Schmidt had been in Spain for
                            the Christmas holidays. He said he was hanging on the telephone each day
                            hoping for word from Washington on the American reaction to the
                            invasion. However, it took the U.S. a week to decide that this was the
                            greatest threat to international peace since World War II, which by the
                            way it was not. During that first week, Schmidt had had to make the
                            Chancellor’s traditional New Year’s Eve speech to the nation. He had
                            redone the text in Spain after the invasion but had he known what we
                            were going to say a few days later, he would not have looked so hesitant
                            in the speech. Then, Schmidt continued, he had gone to see Giscard on
                            January 7. They had tried to evaluate the situation and the American
                            reaction to it and they had failed. They simply did not know what the
                            Americans were up to. Although this was now water over the dam, Schmidt
                            noted it was not good that two of America’s closest Allies could not
                            figure out the U.S. position a week after the crisis had begun. This
                            must be avoided in the future. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> agreed and then went on to say that
                            though we appreciated Germany’s rhetorical expressions of solidarity, it
                            was now time for the FRG to act in a tangible way. We understood
                            Germany’s vulnerability, but we also believed that the Federal Republic
                            had to act. (S)</p>
                        <p>In response, <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> asked, “Do you really
                            understand our vulnerability Zbig, do you really?” Schmidt stressed
                            there were several elements to that vulnerability: Berlin, divided
                            families, and the 16 million Germans in the GDR who would be victimized
                            by an East–West confrontation. And, the Chancellor asserted, America’s
                            reaction had not been all that tangible either. Moreover, Tehran had
                            made it easier for the U.S. to change course dramatically in our
                            relations with the Soviets. The Federal Republic had not had such a
                            stimulus and it would take the Germans longer. Schmidt said it was
                            necessary for his government to appear to German public opinion as
                            stable and consistent. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Brzezinski</hi> repeated that we were not indifferent
                            to Germany’s vulnerability, but stressed that there was a feeling on
                            this side of the Atlantic that the FRG’s reaction had been almost
                            entirely rhetorical. That was simply not the case with the U.S.—witness
                            the grain decision and the fact that we had suspended all our trade with
                            Moscow. (S)</p>
                        <p>Still complaining, <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> said that nine weeks
                            after we had first raised the suggestion of expanding the COCOM list, we
                            still had not come through with a specific proposal. In any event, if
                            the chips were down the U.S. should not doubt that Germany and France
                            would be on its side. (S)</p>
                        <p>In closing the conversation, <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> said that
                            Guenther Huonker, a politician in the Chancellor’s office would be
                            visiting Washington in the next couple of months and asked that Dr.
                            Brzezinski see him. <hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski</hi> agreed.
                            Chancellor <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> remarked that not every German
                            who arrived in Washington was his megaphone. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Brzezinski</hi> responded that not every German who left Washington
                            was his megaphone. (S)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Assume many issues have already
                            been covered in the above conversations, but it would be good to review
                            whole range of them again. The greatest reassurance to me is our common
                            friendship and shared purposes. Difference of approaches and even
                            occasional inadequate coordination still does not overcome our common
                            ties.</p>
                        <p>Our current relations with the ANZUS countries are good, they are getting
                            better with the PRC (though there could be problems), and they are
                            better with NATO. We now have a better relationship with Africa, and we
                            have worked closely with the British in Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>In the Middle East, we are committed to the resolution of the autonomy
                            talks. They are due to end by the end of May. I will be prepared then to
                            apply stronger pressure. We may have a confrontation then with Israel.
                            We are more compatible with Egypt than with Israel on some of these
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>In the Persian Gulf, we look on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as an
                            unacceptable development. Within bounds of what we have done, we want to
                            continue with arms limitations, CSCE, etc. We will honor existing
                            agreements, but bilateral relations have deteriorated.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets are building up in Afghanistan, and they give no indication
                            of withdrawing.</p>

                        <p>The Soviets would like to sow discord among us. This is also the case in
                            the mass media. In the event of a serious crisis, we can count on the
                            French. Giscard has two-front domestic problem but he will stick with
                            us. (Schmidt shows the President a chart of Western forces in Germany
                            and how the French would participate in active defense in the event of

                                the information to his secretary. Strauss added: “I don’t want to

                            million Germans under communist rule. We cannot overlook that. As
                            regards Afghanistan, it is principally a matter of the carrot and the
                            stick. They will not be moved out by force. Zbig said earlier that
                            Western unity and Islamic outrage are needed preconditions for Soviet
                            withdrawal from Afghanistan, but that won’t exist as long as the

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> It was my speculation. Let me please say
                            that some people of course, in the French, British, German press, I
                            don’t know what the other Europeans have said, are speculating whether
                            the Heads of State or Heads of Governments in Europe and in America are
                            communicating over the media with the other leaders. This is certainly
                            not the case and I think we shall take the opportunity within the next
                            couple of days to make it clear that we are in necessary and close
                            personal contact. I just talked to Valery, and he told me that you had
                            been in contact with him, a couple of days ago.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> Let me tell you that on Sunday,<note

                            had a couple of hours with the leading members of the Cabinet, including
                            the parliamentary and political leaders, Brandt, Wehner and others, so
                            we were nine or ten people altogether talking about Iran, and all the
                            other subjects I have mentioned; and I am glad to tell you that we were
                            very united in the opinion which we at the end articulated and I would
                            just like to mention them now to you one after the other. I have also
                            the opportunity tonight, within the next quarter of an hour, to go over
                            to Parliament to talk to the Foreign Relations Committee in a private
                            session to tell them what is in the making.</p>
                        <p>First, Iran. As you know from early January, we are still not really
                            convinced that extending economic sanctions will help to liberate the
                            hostages, but we will certainly follow through. We are determined to
                            take that decision next week in our Cabinet.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Yes, I am not sure either. There is no
                            way to be sure.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> I think it opens up two dangerous
                            possibilities: one danger is that they fall back on the Soviet Union
                            which they will not like, but they may feel they may be forced to and
                            secondly, if sanctions don’t work, then in a couple of weeks, we have to
                            come to the point where we have to ask for other measures.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Yes.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> Anyway, we will participate. Valery will
                            participate. I guess we’ll get a consensus with the EC Foreign

                                22.</note> next week. They are sitting together Monday or Tuesday;
                            we will try to form a so-called European umbrella for the Nine
                            governments to act on a national basis. Possibly, we might also act by a
                            joint decision. The Rome Treaty has some clause, the famous article 113
                            which may be useful as an end. Anyway, I guess you will see in the
                            course of next week some European Cabinets, at least, anyway my Cabinet
                            to publicly decide that we take economic sanctions. They would be
                            declared next Wednesday,<note n="9" xml:id="d134fn9">April 23.</note>
                            but probably becoming effective a fortnight after the election of the
                            Parliament, if within that fortnight the hostages are not freed. This
                            would mean about the date which you mentioned five minutes ago.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Well, you know, we have indications
                            that it is very doubtful that the Parliament is going to be elected at
                            all. And the date that I mentioned was really either mid-May or two
                            weeks after the Majlis . . .</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> Good. I will make sure that we say either
                            a fortnight after the election or mid-May.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> That sounds good.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> I will tell Valery as well.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Good.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> Second point is that I would like once
                            again to tell you privately that I am deeply worried about many rumors
                            which one hears here about military measures being in preparation. I
                            understand that one has to prepare oneself for any contingency, but I
                            hear from the Iraqis, from the United Emirates, from the Saudis that
                            they are rather afraid of the possible outcome of all this, and I would
                            very much like you to be careful and think about it a second time before
                            you take any such decision. The Soviets are only waiting for a pretext
                            under which they could intervene.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> I understand what you’re saying.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> As regards the Olympic Games, we will
                            next Wednesday, in Cabinet, decide as follows: in January I have told my
                            Parliament that under present circumstances, one could not participate
                            in the Olympic Games and that it was absolutely necessary for the Soviet
                            Union to change the circumstances. I will then repeat what you and I
                            have said jointly in our press statements on the 5th of March when I was
                            in Washington.<note n="10" xml:id="d134fn10">See “Visit of Chancellor
                                Schmidt of the Federal Republic of Germany: Joint Press Statement,”

                                438–441.</note> Thirdly, I will say that unfortunately the
                            circumstances have not improved, which they really haven’t, and that
                            therefore the German Cabinet is advising the National Olympic Committee
                            not to go to Moscow.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> That’s good news.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> I will tell this to the leading members
                            of the National Olympics Committee tomorrow afternoon, but the official
                            decision of the Cabinet will only be taken Wednesday next week because I
                            cannot take it behind the backs of our Cabinet. I have just told Valery
                            and he accepts this and will in fact later on follow suit, but will not
                            make a declaration at the same time, which I deplore really but I have
                            the feeling that regarding your situation, I have now to deviate from my
                            former plans. So we will make our decision public next Wednesday; and I
                            am rather confident that our National Olympics Committee will follow the
                            advice.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Yes, I am too.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> Regarding Afghanistan and the Soviet
                            Union, I would like your collaborators to again look to the transcripts
                            of the talks between you and me on March 5, because I have the feeling
                            that some of the American officials may not have read it. Here there are
                            some rumors that make me feel that this is not really understood that I
                            have decided to obey the obligations which I have made under treaty and
                            agreement with the Soviet Union. This means that we will agree in the
                            OECD or whatever in the COCOM is being reached or also changed, but they
                            should not tell us to break off our economic relations with the Soviet
                            Union. The reasons I gave you at the time I was in the White House
                            haven’t changed in the meantime, and I might tell you that the Olympic
                            thing will deteriorate the relationship between the two Germanies very
                            severely. They will cut off the sports traffic between the Germans of
                            either side and this will be the measure they take immediately—they will
                            take other measures afterwards—which they have not specified to me, but
                            altogether it will hit the East Germans more than the West Germans. It
                            will hit the family relationships. It might hit Berlin; I don’t know. I
                            think one should be aware that this will lead to great human hardship. I
                            would like in this context to thank you. You made clear not only in your
                            talks with Stobbe, but also in your television talks with the European
                            journalists, that you understand our special position clearly—that a
                            divided nation is another situation than, let us say France or Canada or
                            America or Britain, or whoever. I am really grateful for this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Well, that’s good. I don’t think anyone
                            in our government feels that you are promising any major change in your
                            economic relationships with the Soviet Union; as a matter of fact, when
                            I got through my discussions with you I was quite discouraged with
                            that.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> I hope that everyone understands that I
                            have national interests to consider as well.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Well, I’ll make that clear to Secretary
                            Vance and others so there will not be any misunderstanding about it. I
                            wish that you had agreed to do more; but it was very clear to me that
                            you were going to maintain basically your existing relationships with
                            them on economics.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> There is one point that I am particularly
                            touchy about. Being a German, I mean a German that grew up in the Hitler
                            war. Germany, after having broken so many treaties in the Hitler period,
                            has to honor its existing treaties. It is a moral feeling in myself,
                            apart from all the political considerations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Yes, and as you probably know, Helmut,
                            we are honoring all of our government-to-government agreements with the
                            Soviet Union as well. We have not broken any of those agreements.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> That is a very
                            necessary point. Otherwise one endangers the agreements which run in our
                            favor.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Yes. We have not done that. In fact the
                            agreement for us to sell 8 million tons of grain to the Soviet Union was
                            a government agreement, and we honored it. So we have not violated any
                            of the agreements with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt:</hi> I have heard that Cy Vance is going to
                            Vienna to see Gromyko, which I really welcome, and that on the way to
                            Vienna he will stop over, which I welcome even more.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> That has not been decided. That is not
                            an accurate report yet.</p>

                            the last weekend, namely that perhaps one could bring the preliminary
                            talks or negotiations about medium-range weapons and get them underway
                            by an interim agreement between the two governments not to station
                            weapons in the next two and three-quarter years until the beginning of
                            1982 which we would not be able to do anyway. This could in a way give
                            the Soviets a face-saving device not to deploy additional SS–20s until
                            then. This would stop the Russians from deploying a rocket every week
                            with three warheads.<note n="12" xml:id="d134fn12">Telegram 7199 from

                            relationship is the highest since the war. There are fundamental reasons
                            for this—nearly twenty years of American trauma which have produced a
                            large ensemble of uncertain trumpets; the growth of Soviet military
                            power and Moscow’s demonstrated willingness to use it; the FRG’s
                            reliance on the Soviets for good relations with East Germany which are
                            critical to eventual German reunification; increased FRG economic
                            dependence on Moscow; and the emergence of a more confident and
                            assertive Germany less willing to follow the U.S. lead automatically.
                            Added to these long-term trends are more passing phenomena which also
                            breed distrust—Schmidt’s close relationship with Giscard and his
                            persistent public complaints about the President;<note n="2"

                                for Germany when he was briefing the press and referred to the

                                about it but thought, in any case, that you should know that this
                                story came out of the White House and is obviously believed from the

                            overreacted to Afghanistan and that especially with respect to Iran, it
                            is we and not the Soviets who pose the immediate threat to international
                            peace and stability. The Germans want an island of detente in Europe but

                            creating such a body, we would be duplicating Franco–German
                            consultations which have existed for more than a decade. We have to
                            reverse years of drift in the U.S.–German relationship and we have to do

                            of the NATO decision and this is an intentional or unintentional

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski:</hi> Schmidt is quoted as saying that
                            he stands by a three year freeze in installation of middle range

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador Von Staden:</hi> I can’t find the statement
                            at the moment. I could send you the text through the channel that we

                            serve peace if both sides did not deploy for the next three years and
                            instead negotiate soon on mutual reductions.”<note n="3"

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador Von Staden:</hi> That sounds correct. As far
                            as I can remember he said deployment can not take place before the
                            second half of 1983 and that one should use that time to negotiate.
                            What’s missing is his statement that it is a technical reason which
                            gives us the time.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski:</hi> Unless I misunderstand, I can’t
                            help wondering how consistent this is with our December 12 position that
                            we should go ahead on TNF. Our joint security analysis is that an
                            imbalance exists now. A three year freeze would make it very difficult
                            to go ahead with our current plans and this could be misunderstood, and
                            I take it is a misunderstanding as recommending a freeze.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador Von Staden:</hi> It is unfortunate that I
                            cannot get hold of this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski:</hi> Maybe tomorrow you could give me
                            the wording or Peter Hermes could give me the wording.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador Von Staden:</hi> I think I can get it in a
                            minute. I have it now. He says that the first deployments can take place
                            at the earliest at the second half of 1983. Until the first weapons are
                            actually in place, it will take three years and NATO, the U.S., has at
                            the same time the proposed immediate negotiations on the mutual
                            limitations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski:</hi> While going ahead with TNF.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador Von Staden:</hi> This time element leaves
                            the theory open to the Soviet Union to further enlarge its present
                            advantage in an extraordinary way. I already pointed out to the
                            Secretary General in May 1978 that there is a great danger in this
                            advantage which the Soviet Union has. My suggestion to use this time gap
                            for negotiations until deployment can take place has been rejected by
                            the Soviet side and some in the West have misrepresented these proposals
                            (he does not say directly)—misrepresented this as a softening of
                            positions. I stick to what I said. It would be useful for peace if
                            within this time both sides would not deploy but immediately start talks
                            about mutual limitations. I assume that anyway in the context of SALT
                            III negotiations will take place. We will contribute to these
                            negotiations even if as a non-nuclear power we cannot negotiate
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski:</hi> Our concern is about the impact of
                            this on the Belgians and Western public opinion where it could be
                            misunderstood as suggesting that we do not go ahead with implementing
                            the TNF decision. We know deployment will take place two or three years
                            from now, but a tremendous number of preparatory steps are needed in the
                            meantime. During which time we negotiate.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador Von Staden:</hi> He says, “Until the first
                            putting into position (of the weapons), it takes more than three
                            years.”</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski:</hi> But in the meantime, everyone goes
                            ahead with what they are doing.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador Von Staden:</hi> Right.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Brzezinski:</hi> You might want to check how the

                            distorted. I look forward to seeing you in Venice.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador Von Staden:</hi> We will act on this and I’m
                            going to send you the verbatim tomorrow morning.<note n="4"

                                this message under cover of a June 11 memorandum that reads:
                                “Muskie, Brown and I concur that it would be most desirable if the
                                enclosed message were sent directly from you to Schmidt. His
                                comments have caused confusion and are potentially damaging to our

                                inadequate position on TNF.)” Carter approved the transmission of
                                the message after it was revised to incorporate his handwritten
                                amendments. (Ibid.) According to Document 208, the message was dated

                            meeting of the SPD delegates have again caused confusion about the
                            position of your government both here and in Europe.<note n="2"

                            incorrectly have claimed that you have proposed an East–West freeze on
                            TNF deployments, and others imply you have called on the Soviets to
                            cease further TNF deployments for a fixed period of time.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d137fn3">In this sentence, Carter amended the earlier draft,

                            it would be appropriate if I took the immediate opportunity to state
                            once more our views on this matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d137fn4">In this
                                sentence, Carter amended the earlier draft, which read “I am sure
                                this confusion will be clarified in the coming days when we see the
                                full text of your remarks, but in view of your upcoming trip to
                                Moscow,” to read: “In view of your upcoming trip to

                        <p>The U.S. will not agree to any proposal for a freeze, moratorium, or
                            renunciation of new or additional missile deployments, even for a fixed
                            period of time. Such a proposal would be unequal and inconsistent with
                            the Alliance’s December 12 decision, which I know you continue strongly
                            to support. It would not be in the security interests of the Alliance to
                            make or to accept any proposal that would perpetuate and legitimate the
                            vast Soviet superiority in the field of long-range theater nuclear
                            missiles. It was this superiority that led NATO to decide to deploy
                            long-range TNF. A Soviet agreement to halt their deployments at their
                            current levels would not remove that need. Agreement to a freeze would
                            threaten to perpetuate the very gap we hope to close through our own
                            deployments and genuine arms limitations.</p>
                        <p>Continuing confusion will only undermine Allied solidarity on this
                            central security issue, and have hard consequences for the future of the
                            Alliance.</p>
                        <p>When questioned by the press this week, I have stated that you were one
                            of the originators of the common commitment to meet the formidable SS–20

                        </list>
                        <p>Since your March 5 discussion with Schmidt, the direction of his policies
                            and public statements have proceeded in an ever more worrying direction.
                            He repeatedly stresses to the German people that the principal danger
                            today is not Soviet aggression but an accidental superpower
                            confrontation reminiscent of 1914. Western Europe is thus trapped
                            between the United States and the Soviet Union, equally immature and
                            equally dangerous. This sort of talk has frightened the German voter and
                            now even Genscher, who began these crises with unstinting support for
                            the U.S., is following Schmidt’s bridge-building line lest the FDP be
                            decimated in the October elections. (S)</p>
                        <p>We can do nothing about this problem of German drift in the short term
                            although we should go on making clear that their hope for an island of
                            detente in Europe is a self-destructing fantasy. The American people
                            will not long support the U.S. defense of Europe if this idea is
                            predominant on the other side of the Atlantic and the Soviet Union will
                            eventually increase its blackmail to a level which the Western Europeans
                            will be unwilling to pay. But that battle with Schmidt will principally
                            be fought by your next administration. (S)</p>
                        <p>During this meeting, you should concentrate on Schmidt’s June 30–July 1
                            visit to the Soviet Union. While it remains true that Schmidt can have
                            neither too much success nor too much failure in Moscow without damaging
                            his electoral prospects, the present mood of appeasement among German
                            voters gives him more latitude than we would like. There are two issues
                            in particular on which you should concentrate. (S)</p>
                        <p>Schmidt continues to play around in his public speeches with the idea of
                            a mutual freeze on U.S. and Soviet TNF deployments until 1983. You
                            should make unmistakably clear to the Chancellor that we will not accept
                            such a proposal which would legitimate the extraordinary Soviet
                            superiority in these long-range systems and would foster the likelihood
                            it would be politically impossible in Western Europe to end the freeze
                            in 1983 when the time came to deploy our LRTNF weapons there. Even a
                            call for the Soviets to halt deployments until 1983 would have that
                            effect. Schmidt should go away from his meeting with you convinced that
                            we will make this matter a public issue between us in the months before
                            the German election if he takes this route in Moscow. (S)</p>
                        <p>The Germans are also giving every sign that they would accept something
                            less than total Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in order to resume
                            unqualified detente. They have told us that they believe the Islamic
                            negotiating group should meet with Babrak Karmal in order to stimulate
                            negotiations concerning the future of Afghanistan. This of course would
                            meet an important Soviet objective since their occupation of
                            Afghanistan, the beginning of recognition of their puppet Babrak by the
                            international community. Another Schmidt idea is to persuade the Soviets
                            to withdraw their “offensive” capability such as the two airborne
                            divisions and the fighter bombers from Afghanistan which would
                            demonstrate Moscow’s benign intentions toward Pakistan and Iran. Any
                            such concept would of course implicitly recognize that the Soviets could
                            indefinitely occupy Afghanistan with their remaining 60,000 troops
                            there. Schmidt should understand that if while in Moscow he takes any
                            steps which authenticate the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, he is in
                            for a major public row with us. He will seek to convince you that he
                            will be an utterly trustworthy emissary of the West during his
                            discussions in the Soviet Union. Most evidence of these past several
                            months argues to the contrary. (S)</p>
                        <p>Finally, Schmidt may mention his reaction to your recent letter
                            suggesting we intensify U.S.–German consultations at the policy
                                level.<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">See footnote 4, Document
                                202.</note> One way to approach the problem would be to establish a
                            bilateral panel with about five on a side which would meet every two
                            months or so to work through the current strains in our relationship.

                            Meeting with Chancellor Schmidt.</p>
                        <p>1. (C)—Entire text.</p>
                        <p>2. Following in para. 3 below is text of report prepared by SFRC Staff
                            Director William Bader on Senator Biden’s June 11 meeting with
                            Chancellor Schmidt. Senator Biden met briefly with the Secretary June 13
                            to pass on copy of report, and Bader had somewhat longer discussion with
                            Vest and EUR/CE Director Niles to review highlights of meeting. Bader
                            advised that Senator Biden planned press conference at 4:00 P.M. June 13
                            during which he planned to express full confidence and assurance in
                            steadfastness of FRG position in support of United States without
                            getting into substance of his conversation with Schmidt. Biden also used
                            a June 13 closed hearing of SFRC, at which the Deputy Secretary
                            discussed outlook for Venice Summit, to inform his colleagues on
                            highlights of his Bonn visit. Bader said he planned to do separate
                            report on meeting with Foreign Minister Genscher.<note n="2"

                        <p>3. Begin text of report:</p>
                        <p>Senator Biden, accompanied by William Bader, met at the Chancellery with
                            Helmut Schmidt at 3:00 P.M. on June 11. The Chancellor had with him
                            Ambassador Berndt von Staden and the new German Ambassador to the United
                            States, Peter Hermes. The meeting was scheduled to last a little less
                            than an hour but ran on for approximately one hour and 45 minutes.</p>
                        <p>The first impression of the Chancellor was that he was tired, distracted
                            and irritable. For the first fifteen minutes he lectured rather than
                            discussed, and throughout the meeting both smoked heavily and took snuff
                            five or six times. After the first few minutes he moved from lecturing
                            and complaining to solid discourse with Senator Biden; and in the final
                            moments said that this had been a good and productive meeting.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt began by commenting—in abrasive terms—on the contrast between the
                            reports of the American Ambassador, whom he trusted, and the reports of
                            the American press, particularly the <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi>. He complained that the U.S. Government should listen to
                            its Ambassador and not to the likes of John Vinocur of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Times</hi>. He said he was absolutely fed up with the
                            distortions and mistrust of the American authorities as fed by an
                            irresponsible press. He said he was about to say “to hell with it” and
                            go it alone.</p>
                        <p>Senator Biden interjected that he felt that part of the problem was the
                            twin concerns felt in the U.S. over Afghanistan and Schmidt’s election
                            campaign. Americans wanted to know—particularly some of the German’s
                            staunchest friends in the Senate—what he was going to do in Moscow and
                            what price he was prepared to pay for Moscow—because there would be a
                            price. Schmidt replied that his anger over how he has been treated over
                            the handling of the Euro-strategic systems was total. It was he who made
                            the speech in 1977 raising the issue of the discrepancy in medium range
                            systems. It was he who pursued it at Guadeloupe. It was he who pressed
                            the TNF decision through NATO, including putting great direct and
                            indirect pressure on the Italians (including the Communists), Belgians
                            and Dutch. He believed he understood the issue and indeed had formulated
                            it. The mistrust of the U.S. Government was as unwarranted as it was
                            unacceptable. He wanted Senator Biden to know that he considered it
                            unacceptable to settle for 572 new nuclear strategic systems in Europe.
                            It must be less—whether it be 400 or 300 or 250. These levels are—and
                            must be—negotiable. What has to be done is to negotiate in the context
                            of SALT III. He stressed that the nonratification of SALT remained the
                            greatest of dangers to the U.S. leadership in the West. This danger was
                            heightened by the fact that American leadership had already abdicated in
                            the international economic and political spheres, and with the loss of
                            SALT II, the bankruptcy of American leadership would be total.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt then went to the subject of TNF and his mission to Moscow. He
                            said that he had first presented the idea of a freeze on deployments to
                            the Russians in a form and forum that he believed made the idea seem
                            attractive to them—because the freeze concept as initially presented had
                            a strong element of equality. He regretted that disclosure of his
                            proposal, plus the necessity to defend it publicly for the “benefit” of
                            allies had seriously undermined—perhaps destroyed—the possibility that
                            the Soviets would accept such a freeze. With great intensity, including
                            hammering the table, Schmidt argued that the 1983 deployment date for
                            NATO medium-range systems gave us some 36 months for negotiations—closer
                            to 35 for the clock is running and the Russians are deploying medium
                            range systems at the rate of 45 per year. Schmidt argued that he was not
                            going to Moscow to negotiate but to help “establish a trend” for
                            negotiations. The issue is one of convincing and cajoling the Russians
                            to enter into discussions and negotiations in a preliminary way. The
                            Chancellor stated again that SALT II must be ratified, and with that
                            ratification SALT II would be an acceptable basis for negotiations on
                            Europe’s Euro-strategic problem. Senator Biden asked whether the
                            Russians were aware that the ratification of SALT was at a standstill
                            because of Afghanistan, and unless there was movement on Afghanistan, we
                            would not be able to move SALT through the Senate. Are the Russians
                            aware of this? Are you aware of it? Schmidt replied that he was sure
                            that the Russians were not aware of it; and for himself he was not
                            entirely sure that this was the case. As for Afghanistan, he did not
                            believe that it had fundamentally changed the situation with regard to
                            SALT. He compared Afghanistan and Iran and argued that Iran had become
                            an outlet for American frustration and that the two issues, Afghanistan
                            and Iran, had become inseparable. Biden countered that this was not the
                            case at all, that the issues were in fact separable—that the American
                            people do not connect the two in an important fashion—and understood the
                            implications and dangers involved in this major new departure of Soviet
                            policy—the invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>The mention of Afghanistan got the Chancellor to a long discourse on the
                            U.S. response to Afghanistan. Schmidt argued vigorously that the Soviets
                            “cannot be allowed to get away with it” and it must be made extremely
                            painful for them to remain there. The problem was, that the West was
                            seriously and fundamentally challenged in Afghanistan and rather than
                            coming up with a coherent strategy of resistance, the President produced
                            the Olympic boycott. The Chancellor said that he had agreed to the
                            boycott at a great cost to himself and his party. He said, “I have
                            delivered, others have not.” All this in spite of the fact that 70–80
                            percent of the German population does not agree with the government’s
                            decision. Nevertheless, only Norway and Monaco have followed the U.S.
                            lead. Margaret Thatcher bristles and postures but delivers nothing.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor went on to say that August 3 will arrive, the Games will
                            be over and the Russians will still be in Afghanistan. He said that in
                            his effort to push the West to a more coherent and broader strategy of
                            response, he had delivered papers to Washington but had received
                            absolutely no response. What he did receive was “a shopping list” of
                            possible actions but no strategy.</p>
                        <p>Senator Biden then returned to the subject of Moscow and asked what the
                            Chancellor hoped to accomplish and particularly what would be the
                            relationship of that effort to SALT II.</p>
                        <p>Speaking with heat and great intensity, Schmidt stated as a start SALT
                            should not have seen put in a “ratifiable” form. In his view, it was
                            just impossible to move such a complicated agreement through the
                            necessary two-thirds barrier of acceptance. But what has been done has
                            been done. He does think that the Russians will in fact honor the terms
                            of SALT II with the exception of the requirement for dismantlement of
                            some of the older missiles. He said he did not expect them to go forward
                            with that dismantlement. As for his trip to Moscow, “why are you so
                            mistrustful” Schmidt said. On the basis of what record, what
                            indiscretion are you concerned about? Are you concerned that this
                            government and this Chancellor will sell out the Alliance? If you are so
                            concerned, let me give you my agenda for Moscow with regard to TNF and
                            strategic issues.</p>

                                of Germany to try to make use of those three years.</item>

                                not interfere with the implementation of the TNF decision. The
                                siting will be done, the production will go forward, the plans will
                                be made. Nothing could be clearer.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Chancellor told Senator Biden that he must appreciate “that it is my
                            soil that is at stake.” He said Germany is the size of the state of
                            Oregon and we must understand that there are some six to seven thousand
                            nuclear warheads in that small area. Imagine the concern and reaction in
                            the U.S. if there were a similar area of landbased missiles between
                            Boston and New York or New York and Washington. Senator Biden raised the
                            question of what the reaction of our other European allies to the Moscow
                            initiative would be. Would Belgium or the Netherlands or even Italy be
                            tempted to weaken their resolve over the December TNF decision if they
                            saw Germany seemingly tamper with that decision in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt then went down the list of TNF countries. He began by saying that
                            what happens in Belgium simply does not matter. Belgium was on the brink
                            of dissolving the unification of 1830 and tumbling into linguistic
                            division. As for the Netherlands it was difficult to gage. In many ways
                            the Christian Democrats have pulled themselves together as well as
                            easing out some of the TNF “softies.” He thought things were looking up
                            in the Netherlands. When Senator Biden interjected to say that he had
                            spoken the day before with the Italian Foreign Minister Colombo and
                            Colombo had said with all Italy’s problems with respect to TNF, it would
                            be extremely difficult if we looked to the North and thought Germany was
                            weakening.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt’s response was heated. He said the Italians as well as Americans
                            should be looking at what I am doing and they should trust me.</p>
                        <p>Senator Biden said there was no question that the Chancellor had the
                            “right to go to Moscow” but that he should understand the concerns and
                            hesitations of his partners. Biden said that the Chancellor might recall
                            that during their last meeting, Schmidt had said that when the U.S.
                            sneezed, Europe tended to get a cold.<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3"

                                File, D790238–0262)</note> The Chancellor should appreciate that we
                            have reached a situation now that when Germany even nods the rest of us
                            tend to stir. We must try to understand what the Germans are up to.
                            Schmidt responded by asking why must we always try to be understood. We
                            can’t be the psychiatrist of the United States. Biden replied that
                            America had been Europe’s psychiatrist for many years, perhaps it was
                            time for a role reversal. Schmidt conceded the point; but said that
                            Europeans do not have the strength to be psychiatrists. Over the years
                            the U.S. has been both strong and naive—naive enough to be
                            self-confident. On the other hand, Europeans have an inferiority
                            complex. We do not feel confident enough to pat you on the back and hold
                            your hand.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt again returned to the theme of trust. Look at Germany, we have
                            not only delivered on the Olympics but we have also delivered on Turkey.
                            Again, the British are all talk and no action. Why are you so worried
                            about Germany. Why do you doubt? Biden replied that it was not out of
                            fear of a strong and powerful Germany. In fact, the U.S. welcomed a
                            strong Germany. Schmidt countered by saying that many in the U.S. do in
                            fact fear a strong Germany and he would prefer that Germany avoid the
                            appearance of strength, although it might have the reality. Schmidt said
                            that a largely Eastern dominated American press heightens fears within
                            the U.S. as to what a strong Germany would do. He understood this
                            reaction. He had recently told his 34-year old daughter, who said she
                            bore no responsibility for the crimes of Hitler, that all Germans at
                            least to the end of this century will bear a deep responsibility not
                            only for the “gasification” of millions of Jews as well as being the
                            reason for a war that killed almost 200 million. It is a reality and we
                            have to live with it.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt then turned to the theme of Southwest Asia, Afghanistan and the
                            Persian Gulf. He accepted Biden’s point that the “sharing of
                            responsibility” could include U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf and
                            German aid to Turkey and to Pakistan. He said the German aid to Turkey,
                            which has gone up dramatically—twice the U.S. aid—was not particularly
                            appreciated in Washington. Moreover, the U.S. through its embargo had
                            seriously weakened Turkey leaving it without spare parts and depriving
                            its military forces of the ways and means of meeting their NATO
                            commitments. Senator Biden countered sharply, stating that he had
                            recently been to Turkey and had been told by the Turkish General Staff
                            that Turkey needed at least $15 billion in military assistance in order
                            to return to an acceptable NATO combat readiness. The embargo, which
                            involved a few hundred million dollars in military equipment, was
                            certainly not the cause for Turkey’s military demise.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d139fn4">Reference is to an embargo on U.S. arms sales to
                                Turkey, which lasted from 1975 to 1978. See <ref

                            conceded this point. But he went on to say that the West needs the
                            support of Pakistan, even the support of such unsavory states as Iraq
                            and the Emirates, as well as Turkey. Pakistan and Turkey are the
                            cornerstone of any Western strategy in Southwest Asia. But what have we
                            done? The United States took a military package of 200 million to
                            Pakistan when it had to have much more in order to make a commitment and
                            now the U.S. seems to be resisting the rescheduling of Pakistani
                            debt—this, in the Chancellor’s view, would be an absolute disaster. He
                            also said that we must appreciate that we will need the Arabs and that
                            solution of the Palestinian issue is imperative to gaining that support.
                            When Senator Biden asked what was next for Turkey, the Chancellor said
                            that one of the reasons the Alliance must pull together is that Germany
                            has done all that it can financially for Turkey: “We have done much but
                            we have come as far as we can.”</p>
                        <p>Toward the end of the meeting Schmidt seemed both relaxed and very
                            engaged. He obviously feels that communications between the U.S. and
                            Germany now seemed to be through distorted press releases and not

                            opportunity to speak frankly and fully to someone in the Senate who
                            cared about Europe and European relations. He wanted Senator Biden to
                            know as a final thought that you can depend “on the bloody Germans.” End

                        <p>I had the opportunity for a brief, private conversation with the
                            Chancellor Friday afternoon, June 13, at the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung
                            before he went into the seminar meeting. The Chancellor said he had
                            received a message from the President on TNF and asked if I had seen it.
                            I said I had.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">See Document 204. In a June 18
                                message to Vance, Stoessel wrote: “I wanted to bring to your
                                attention the problem I had last Friday, when I was confronted at
                                lunch by the President’s press spokesman, Klaus Boelling, with the
                                fact that the President had sent a letter on the TNF issue to the
                                Chancellor about which I had no knowledge. Von Staden, the
                                Chancellor’s foreign affairs advisor, subsequently spoke to me about
                                the letter, but I was unable to comment on it. We were successful in
                                our efforts in obtaining a copy of the message from the Department
                                before I saw the Chancellor, who assumed I had known about the
                                letter all along and wanted to talk to me about it.” (Telegram 11506

                            understand why such a message had been sent. He simply did not know why
                            the President would have done such a thing. He thought the President’s
                            message probably had been motivated by the article by Vinocur in <hi

                        <p>The Chancellor said that he would make a response to the letter which
                            would surprise people.</p>
                        <p>Following the seminar meeting, I had another brief exchange in private
                            with the Chancellor. I said I hoped he would reflect on the situation
                            before sending his reply to the President. Perhaps it would be good if
                            he could telephone the President. In any case, I suggested that he might
                            want to sleep on the matter before taking action.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he would do so.<note n="4" xml:id="d140fn4"
                                >Kissinger, who saw Schmidt during the afternoon of June 16,
                                reported to Stoessel that “he had found the Chancellor in a very
                                upset state of mind as a result of the President’s letter. He said
                                that he had been insulted by the first paragraph, which based
                                Washington concern on TNF on newspaper articles. Moreover, the
                                Chancellor had regarded the last part of the second paragraph, which
                                indicated that the U.S. might go public regarding its own position,
                                as a threat.” The Chancellor also told Kissinger that he had
                                decided, at least for the time being, to discuss the matter
                                personally with Carter instead of responding in writing. (Memorandum

                            understand why such a message had been sent. Moreover, he said he was
                            deeply hurt by the suspicion and mistrust reflected in the President’s

                        <p>For the record and as a measure of self-protection, I wanted to give you
                            my best account of the way in which the President’s June 12 letter to
                            the Chancellor on TNF took form and how the various elements in the
                            Washington bureaucracies performed during this process.<note n="2"

                            our finest hour.</p>
                        <p>As background, I should recall that there exists in the NSC and the White
                            House an enormous reservoir of suspicion of the Chancellor’s objectives
                            and his attitude toward the United States. For all I know, this goes
                            back to the Chancellor’s endorsement of President Ford’s reelection in
                            1976. In any event, the Chancellor’s April statements on TNF provoked
                            grave suspicion and distrust in the NSC and among some offices in this
                            building regarding his intentions. During the intervening period, some
                            of this feeling dissipated as the Chancellor and the FRG bureacracy
                            walked the TNF position back to the point where there did not appear to
                            be too much light between what he was saying and Washington orthodoxy.

                            an additional piece on Schmidt’s June 9 SPD convention speech which
                            claimed that he had returned fully to the position he took April 12–13

                            Secretary to Genscher. George urged that we wait until we had the full
                            text of what was actually said at Freiburg and Essen, but the NSC
                            proceeded with its drafting exercise. In the meantime, Senator Biden met
                            with the Secretary and Christopher prior to his visit to Bonn. My
                            reporting cable on that discussion (State 153085) distinctly underplayed
                            the expressions of concern regarding German policy voiced by both the
                            Secretary and Christopher, who were armed at the meeting with Xeroxed

                            he did make the point that we should wait to see exactly what the

                                TNF in Essen in which he called for NATO and the Soviets to mutually
                                refrain from TNF deployments for the next three years. Zbig plans to
                                have a Presidential letter ready for the three of you to review at

                                dissociation from Schmidt’s proposals unless he backs off. While we
                                think a letter may be a good idea, we believe you should tell Zbig
                                you will want to have the letter reviewed and will get back to him
                                soon with our comments after we have had a chance to read the text

                                xml:id="d141fn9">Telegram 156863 to Bonn, June 13, noted that
                                Genscher had called Muskie on June 11 to express his concerns about
                                press coverage of his June 5 speech to the FDP convention, that the
                                Department’s review of Genscher’s speech showed that Vinocur’s June
                                10 article overstated the change in Genscher’s position, and
                                transmitted Muskie’s message to Genscher. In his message, Muskie
                                wrote: “I fully share your desire that we not allow inaccurate press
                                reporting to cause problems and misunderstandings in our bilateral

                        <p>The next act in the drama was the June 11 Muskie-Brown- Brzezinski lunch
                            at which the NSC draft was reviewed. We had alerted the Secretary to
                            this possibility and proposed that he simply pocket whatever draft
                            Brzezinski presented and agree to get back to the NSC with comments.
                            Unfortunately, the Secretary did not follow this course of action but
                            rather engaged in a redrafting exercise with Brown and Brzezinski which
                            naturally established a certain commitment on his part to the concept of
                            a letter and to the text which emerged from the lunch. Later that
                            afternoon when we learned of this development, Steve Ledogar and I were
                            asked by George Vest to develop a counterdraft. This was at about 6:00
                            p.m. on June 11, and at that point Steve went to work. Shortly
                            thereafter, however, we learned that the NSC draft, as revised by the
                            three principals at lunch, was “on the President’s desk for his
                            approval.” At this point George went up to the 8th Floor where the
                            Secretary’s reception for the Diplomatic Corps was in process, talked to
                            Warren Christopher who then took the Secretary aside and urged that the
                            Department intervene with Brzezinski to stop the process. The Secretary
                            agreed that we were moving in an unfortunate direction and asked
                            Christopher to call Brzezinski, which he did. My understanding is that
                            Brzezinski agreed to see what could be done but made no promises. We
                            must remember, of course, that the President was looking at Brzezinski’s
                            draft so one might question how actively Brzezinski intervened with him.
                            In any case, the next morning when George and I were upstairs to see
                            Christopher regarding preparations for the meeting with van Well June

                            one-to-one contacts with Brzezinski since the latter has so much more
                            detailed familiarity with the issues. Another conclusion is that we must
                            be more alert to initiatives of this type at an early stage and come
                            down hard on them if we are to have any chance of heading them off.</p>

                        <p>After an exchange of the usual pleasantries (though Schmidt and his
                            associates were both grim and tense), the President asked Schmidt about

                        <p>Schmidt replied that he will make a strong statement on Afghanistan, and
                            he will discuss the Soviets’ overwhelming superiority in
                            “Euro-strategic” weaponry.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked for Schmidt’s evaluation of Giscard’s trip.<note

                        <p>Schmidt replied that Giscard was very tough; that Giscard had the
                            impression that Brezhnev leaned toward some flexibility; that Gromyko
                            was tougher and that he called the shots; and that Brezhnev used sheets
                            of paper all of the time.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we obtained a firm and highly inflexible response
                            from Gromyko to Muskie’s recent letter on which our European allies had
                            been briefed beforehand.<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4">For the exchange of

                        <p>Schmidt then said that he has come to discuss “that famous letter,” which
                            has now entered into German politics, having been leaked in
                                Washington;<note n="5" xml:id="d142fn5">Reference is to Carter’s

                            “are close to an insult.” The President interjected that he disagrees
                            with Schmidt’s description of the contents and character of that
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt resumed by saying, “Let me be frank. We have never reneged on any
                            of our pledges. You had the text of what I said.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d142fn6">See footnote 4, Document 203.</note> Neither Brown
                            nor Stoessel objected. The consequences of the letter can only be
                            negative and the leak has been very destructive. I have always delivered
                            on the Olympics, on which I am now isolated; on TNF, I am the one who
                            really sticks to it and who started it—and will stick to it. I was the
                            one who identified the problem. It is ridiculous to suggest that I am
                            changing my mind. I didn’t change it on this nor on the neutron bomb. I
                            risked my political existence on TNF. I am insulted by suggestions that
                            I do not keep my word.”</p>
                        <p>The President said this charge was not made by him nor was it in the
                            letter. Schmidt resumed that all this helps to undermine American–German
                            relations—even though it may even help him politically. But it doesn’t
                            serve our common cause if a reliable ally is abused. The opposition has
                            been exploiting the letter. “I hope I can say there is no wedge between
                            us on TNF or on talks with the Soviets. The letter helps neither of us.”

                            he meant to say—namely, that he was in effect asking for a unilateral
                            Soviet abnegation.) Finally, he said he was now in doubt as to whether
                            Carter really wanted to negotiate with the Soviets on arms control on
                            this issue.</p>
                        <p>The President responded by saying that no one in his administration
                            believes that the FRG does not fulfill its commitments. However, the
                            April story swept the world press. Schmidt told him at the time by
                            telephone that the issue was causing consternation and the President
                            suggested that Schmidt send a message of reassurance and clarification
                            to our allies, because the statement had clouded the issue.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d142fn7">Reference is presumably to Schmidt’s Essen speech.
                                See Document 201 and footnote 12 thereto.</note> Yet later, Schmidt
                            said again that he stands by the April statement. The Belgians are
                            exploiting this. The statement was ill-advised. It has been causing
                            problems in Belgium and in Italy. My letter made it clear that erroneous
                            press reports are causing confusion.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. does not want a “freeze” until 1983. This would mean Western
                            acceptance of permanent imbalance (SS–20 already is in 8 sites with 162
                            launchers). If the Soviets did not engage in further construction of
                            sites, we could not monitor deployment and yet it would be difficult for
                            us to go ahead with construction of our sites since the Belgians, Dutch
                            and even the Italians might be affected.</p>
                        <p>“I think your statement creates confusion, but I have no doubt of your
                            commitment.”</p>
                        <p>(The President then reviewed current U.S. defense spending and the U.S.
                            willingness to make tangible sacrifices.)</p>
                        <p>Other issues: the Soviets must realize that their invasion of Afghanistan
                            precludes business as usual. We appreciate the German support on this
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt then said that he still did not understand the letter nor its
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that the letter was designed to acknowledge that
                            errors in misinterpretation of Schmidt’s views were creating problems
                            and that the U.S. would not agree not to deploy for three years. That
                            would give the Soviets a stamp of approval for gross inequality. (This
                            led to some exchange of why the U.S. accepted the protocol on SALT II,
                            and the President explained the various SALT II trade-offs.)</p>
                        <p>Schmidt recalled his previous views on the strategic issues and
                            reiterated that he was the first to draw attention to the matter.
                            Germany is not the 51st state but has interests of its own and its own
                            special responsibilities. (Schmidt elaborated on the theme.) Moreover,
                            the U.S. is holding up the rescheduling of Turkish debts and the same is
                            true of Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that the U.S. is ready to reschedule debts that
                            are overdue but not ones that are yet to be overdue, maybe as long as
                            three years from now.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt reiterated that Germany is doing what it can and the U.S. is
                            not.</p>
                        <p>(There was an exchange of what the U.S. is prepared to do on Pakistan and
                            the U.S. position was explained.)</p>
                        <p>Brzezinski added that the Europeans ought to take into account the
                            large-scale efforts, which are costly, which the U.S. is undertaking to
                            create a regional security framework for the West Asian region.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt said there is also the need to deal with the Palestinian problem
                            and he said that Vance had agreed to an amendment to UN 242.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d142fn8">Reference is to UN Security Council Resolution 242;
                                see footnote 6, Document 165.</note> (The U.S. side questioned this,
                            but Schmidt reiterated it categorically.) Christopher and Brzezinski
                            also misled us on the Olympics.</p>
                        <p>Brzezinski said that we don’t invite German legislators to read to them
                            indictments on German policies. Yet the Chancellor recently met with
                            Senator Biden and delivered of himself an indictment not only on U.S.
                            policy but on some key U.S. personalities.<note n="9" xml:id="d142fn9"
                                >See Document 206.</note> Schmidt responded that one should be
                            prepared to be criticized and that “I can fight.” Brzezinski responded
                            that the fight can be reciprocal and that there are those on the U.S.
                            side who know how to do that too.</p>
                        <p>(The President, with the wave of his hand, indicated that he thought it
                            would be better to cool the situation.)</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he thinks we now understand each other
                            better.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor responded that he wishes to stop Soviet deployments and
                            that he would like to make them more verifiable in light of the
                            President’s explanation that a halt to Soviet construction wouldn’t make
                            verification more difficult.<note n="10" xml:id="d142fn10">In the margin
                                next to this sentence, Carter wrote a question mark.</note></p>
                        <p>Muskie explained that we all must be careful not to dissolve Western
                            political support for TNF and that we needed to develop a broader range
                            of options in dealing with the longer-term SALT III issue. (There was
                            then a discussion of the Belgian political situation and the likely
                            impact on the Belgians of the Schmidt mission to Moscow.)</p>
                        <p>The President said that the U.S. side will comply with SALT II provisions
                            as long as the Soviets do, in keeping with the Geneva Convention. It
                            might be useful for the Chancellor to ask the Soviets if they would be
                            willing to start negotiating SALT III prior to U.S. ratification of SALT
                            II.</p>
                        <p>Schmidt recapitulated that the target for Moscow was to influence those
                            who matter there. There will be no wedge between the U.S. and FRG, but
                            he also intends to continue economic cooperation with the Soviet Union
                            within the OECD and COCOM framework.<note n="11" xml:id="d142fn11">On
                                July 2, Genscher visited Washington to brief Muskie and Carter on
                                Schmidt’s talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow. (Memorandum of

                        <p>The President said we must make certain that the Soviets know that they
                            must withdraw all their troops from Afghanistan and that we will not
                            recognize or deal with Babrak.</p>
                        <p>Brzezinski explained more fully the President’s proposal for
                            neutralization of Afghanistan, including some international security
                            arrangements involving Islamic forces so that pro-Soviet elements are
                            not slaughtered upon the withdrawal of the Soviet troops.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor inquired if China would be prepared to join in a guarantee
                            of a non-aligned Afghanistan and the President responded “probably.”</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded with a discussion of what both principals will say
                            to the press, agreeing that they will stress consensus on the
                            Afghanistan issue and complete agreement on the TNF issue.</p>
                        <p>(The atmosphere toward the end became quite congenial and relaxed,
                            especially after the more intense clashes in the middle of the
                            conversation. Schmidt was quite agitated at times and occasionally
                            raised his voice. The President was very calm but firm throughout and
                            the Chancellor became less aggressive after the clash over Senator
                            Biden’s report.)</p>

                        <p>Dear Hans-Dietrich</p>
                        <p>Your Chargé d’Affaires, Mr. Dannenbring, informed Undersecretary Cooper
                            August 8 of your government’s decision to allow the FRG firm Kloeckner
                            to conclude a major contract with the Soviet Union for the aluminum
                            smelter at Sayansk, which the U.S. firm Alcoa and Kloeckner had
                            previously planned to supply. Alcoa and Kloeckner had been on the verge
                            of concluding a firm contract for this project at the time of the Soviet
                            invasion of Afghanistan last December. Following that development, Alcoa
                            decided to drop out of the project, after which the export license
                            previously issued by the United States Department of Commerce for

                        <p>I am deeply disappointed and concerned over your government’s decision
                            for several reasons: <list>
                                <label>—</label>
                                <item>To begin with, we had received assurances from you and the
                                    Chancellor that the Federal Government would do nothing to
                                    undercut the measures which the United States had taken in the
                                    economic area in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
                                    The President specifically mentioned the Alcoa project in his
                                    February 9 letter to the Chancellor and stated that “to preserve
                                    the impact of this withdrawal, it is essential that the place of
                                    the American companies not be taken by industrial firms
                                    elsewhere. I hope that we can count on German cooperation in
                                    this regard.”<note n="6" xml:id="d143fn6">See Document

                                    to the Bundestag on February 28, 1980, that, “we are not
                                    stepping into transactions which the United States has given
                                    up.”</item>

                                <item>Such a step will convey to the Soviets a message of
                                    vacillation and disunity on the part of the Western

                                <item>This decision makes it extremely difficult for other countries
                                    such as Japan to prevent its firms from proceeding with similar

                                    have decided to return to a policy of business as usual with the

                                    Afghanistan.</item>

                                <item>Finally, the extension of a very large Hermes guarantee for
                                    this project demonstrates a degree of official support by the
                                    Federal Republic which we find most disquieting. The fact that
                                    the Kloeckner contract does not cover the entire arrangement
                                    which had been originally agreed upon between Kloeckner and
                                    Alcoa, on the one side, and the Soviet Union, on the other, does
                                    not seem to me to detract from the force of these points. This
                                    is, in any case, a fine, technical point which will not be
                                    understood in either your country or mine.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Both of our countries decided, after the invasion of Afghanistan, to take
                            measures to convey to the USSR that their behavior was unacceptable and
                            would lead to effects on both our countries’ relations with the USSR.
                            While our views on tactics may have varied, the Federal Republic and the
                            United States agreed that some actions would be necessary if the Soviets
                            did not withdraw from Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>More than eight months after their invasion, the Soviets continue to
                            occupy that country and to carry out a bloody repression of the
                            Afghanistan people. In these circumstances we have concluded that it is
                            not possible to relax the sanctions we have imposed against the
                            USSR.</p>
                        <p>The Kloeckner decision is likely to be interpreted as indicating that the
                            Federal Republic has embarked on a different course, directed toward
                            reestablishment of normal relations with the Soviet Union; that is
                            surely the way it will be understood in Moscow, and the Soviets will
                            doubtless seek to portray the agreement in this manner. This decision
                            could also affect the attitudes of other countries and lead to a more
                            general unravelling of sanctions.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, we deeply regret your government’s decision in this
                            matter. We believe the rationale as explained to us by your Chargé
                            d’Affaires is shortsighted and fails to take account of broad Western
                            interests. We hope the Federal Republic will reconsider its
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this particular episode, I would very much appreciate receiving
                            your views on how the Western nations should now conduct themselves in
                            their dealings with the USSR. I would be particularly interested in
                            knowing what the Federal Republic’s policy now is on this subject, and
                            what actions the Federal Republic now envisages taking toward the
                            Soviets, in view of your government’s earlier statements of policy, and
                            the USSR’s continuing occupation of Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>With best wishes, I am,</p>

                            August 11, to call attention to this letter and underscore its
                                importance.<note n="7" xml:id="d143fn7">Telegram 223829 to Bonn,
                                August 23, conveyed a letter from Genscher to Muskie that responded
                                to Muskie’s letter and their August 11 conversation. In his letter,
                                Genscher defended FRG Government credit guarantees for the Sayansk
                                project on the grounds that Kloeckner would supply a manually
                                operated plant which would not substitute for the plant that Alcoa
                                had planned to build, which included an automatic process control
                                system that was subject to COCOM. (National Archives, RG 59, Central

                                August 29, reported during Muskie’s August 26 meeting with Genscher,
                                “the Germans wanted to emphasize harmony, and that they attached
                                particular importance to these consultations as evidence of the
                                closeness and essential soundness of our relationship.” The telegram
                                also reported that “the Germans believed that maintaining a certain
                                level of economic cooperation with Moscow could be regarded as a
                                necessary basis for providing needed assistance to EE’s such as
                                Poland. At the same time, the Germans agreed to consider further
                                restrictions within the COCOM framework and emphasized that the FRG
                                agrees fully about the importance of restricting sales of technology
                                for projects of potential military significance to the Soviet
                                Union.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                                    target="#d145fn2">footnote 2</ref>, above), Schmidt predicted
                                that the superpowers would be drawn into the Iran-Iraq war, that oil
                                from the Middle East might be cut off causing high unemployment and
                                political polarization in Western Europe, that “the bad
                                Soviet-American relationship” would stall “detente and its
                                manifestations (CSCE, MBFR and arms control negotiations)” until at
                                least 1982, and that the “inner-German relationship would not be
                                able to develop further until this 1982 time frame.” With respect to
                                TNF, the “smaller West European countries” would “try to stay out of
                                trouble with both sides, but especially with the USSR if US
                                leadership looked uncertain,” which might cause Schmidt serious
                                difficulties with the SPD. (National Archives, RG 59, Central
                                Foreign Policy File, P870117–2120)</note> Moreover, the FDP showing
                            should give Genscher a post-election boost toward his natural Atlantist
                            inclination and strengthen his hand in foreign policy debates with the
                            SPD. Thus, at least for the next several months, we have an opportunity
                            to influence a Schmidt government less able to withstand totally our
                            pressure. This will produce no miracles, and East–West trade will
                            continue to be a difficult issue, but we should be able to make some
                            progress with the Germans on matters of importance to us. After the East
                            German moves, and with the Soviet shadow extending ever darker over
                            Poland, Schmidt will not want to begin his new administration with a
                            renewal of the fight with us. With this background in mind, and in
                            addition to Iran–Iraq, the autonomy talks, the future of SALT II, etc.,

                                Secret. The meeting took place in the Cabinet Room. Schmidt visited
                                the United States from November 18 to 21. On November 20,
                                President-elect Reagan met with Schmidt, and on November 21, Senator
                                James Baker met with Schmidt. No memorandum of conversation for the
                                Reagan-Schmidt meeting has been found. A record of the Baker-Schmidt
                                meeting is in a memorandum from Cran Montgomery to the file,

                                see no point in using this meeting to burrow into the details of the
                                US-German relationship. Such a discussion at this point would have
                                little effect on Schmidt and largely beg the strategic challenges
                                that the West faces in the 1980s.” (Carter Library, National

                            this segment of the talks, <hi rend="italic">Ambassador Owen</hi> urged
                            Schmidt to impress upon the Republicans the need for Republican support
                            for the IDA–6 appropriation which is now before the Congress. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> then asked how Schmidt had found
                            Mrs. Thatcher in their meeting earlier in the week and remarked that she
                            was having severe problems with her economy. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Schmidt</hi> replied that now that Mrs. Thatcher understands that
                            her difficulties at home will not go away quickly, she has become
                            sweeter and sweeter in her contacts with her continental partners.
                            Schmidt continued that the British would not be able to surmount their
                            economic problems only through monetary means. They will have to cut the
                            budget as well. But that will be difficult given the 19th century
                            mentality held by the trade unions and management. Mrs. Thatcher will
                            certainly not be able to reform the British economy in four years and no
                            major progress will be likely if management-union relations are not
                            improved. Schmidt then agreed with Secretary Muskie’s observation that
                            labor-management relations were healthy in the Federal Republic but
                            noted that the German postal workers would be striking this weekend.

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> then asked how serious the strain
                            was between East and West Germany. <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi>
                            responded that the FRG regarded it as a serious setback. The GDR
                            currency measures had already led to a decrease of 60 percent in the
                            travel of West Germans to the GDR.<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">Reference
                                is to GDR currency restrictions introduced on October 5; see
                                footnote 3, Document 212.</note> In response to the President’s
                            question as to whether the East German actions were related to Poland,
                            Schmidt said in effect yes, but in a complicated way. The GDR leadership
                            was afraid that strikes in Poland might spill over into East Germany.
                            That had made the GDR have second thoughts about Schmidt’s visit there
                            which had been planned for September or October. But the East Germans
                            were even more nervous about a possible Soviet intervention in Poland
                            and by taking these actions against the FRG, the GDR was trying to
                            reassure Moscow that a domino effect in Eastern Europe was unlikely.
                            (S)</p>
                        <p>Schmidt continued that the opposition in the FRG was presenting these GDR
                            actions as a breakdown of Ostpolitik. Schmidt disagreed and said the
                            West Germans had had similar experiences in 1974 which had been quickly
                            redressed. Schmidt said he did not believe the Soviets when they
                            asserted they had no part in the GDR decision. The East Germans
                            certainly could not have moved without Moscow’s consent. Schmidt
                            observed that in his State of the Union message next week, he would say
                            that the FRG would not respond to the delimitation policies of the GDR
                            with delimitation policies of its own. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >President</hi> then said that in effect Schmidt was saying that he
                            would not respond to the East German action. The President asked how
                            inter-German trade had been affected, if at all. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Schmidt</hi> replied that the President was correct that the FRG
                            had not responded so far. The East Germans were asking for a
                            prolongation of credits, but Bonn would delay. Nonetheless, the Federal
                            Republic would take no action which would make the walls higher or the
                            ditches deeper. Some, Schmidt said, argued that this was a display of
                            weakness. The Chancellor thought it was a display of strength. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> next asked about FRG economic aid to
                            Poland. Schmidt responded that the West Germans had been helping the
                            Gierek administration and had continued aid to the tune of 1.2 billion
                            DM to the Kania regime. <hi rend="italic">Secretary Muskie</hi> asked
                            how much assistance the Poles had asked for, and without answering,
                            Schmidt said that Poland was and would continue to be an economic
                            disaster. It would require $2–3 billion a year of outside assistance to
                            prevent a catastrophe and the Poles would accept no foreign advice about
                            how to run their economy. Things were very bad there and the Polish
                            Government might even have to ration food this winter. (S)</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question as to whether Kania could handle
                            the situation, <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> said he hoped so. The
                            Chancellor agreed with the President’s comment that long-term debt
                            rescheduling would undoubtedly be necessary. But, the Chancellor
                            continued, that would not help in 1981 or 1982. The Poles needed food
                            and they needed it now. In response to the President’s comments that we
                            had approved $650 million in food aid to the Poles since the crisis
                            began, Schmidt said that economic assistance to Poland was like dripping
                            water on a hot rock. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> then asked how the FRG’s relations
                            with the Kania regime were, and <hi rend="italic">Genscher</hi> replied
                            that none of the West German leadership had ever met Kania. Genscher
                            continued that he doubted that it would be possible for the Polish
                            Communist Party and the independent trade unions to exist side by side
                            for very long. The Party was trying to gain time but there was no way of
                            knowing whether it would be successful. In any event, Genscher noted,
                            the Madrid CSCE meeting was of positive value since the Soviets would
                            not want to intervene while that meeting was taking place.<note n="4"

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> went on to say that he believed the
                            Soviets had decided not to intervene militarily in Poland. But, if a

                            against the wall and despite their desire would feel compelled to send
                            the army in. Schmidt said he had talked to the Pope last Friday<note

                            of good judgment and with wide contacts throughout Poland. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> then asked what we would do if
                            Belgium and Holland decided not to go along with the TNF decision. Would
                            Britain and Italy be enough for the Germans? <hi rend="italic"
                                >Schmidt</hi> replied that in this case, Italy was much more
                            important than Britain because it was both a continental power and a
                            non-nuclear weapons state. The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> noted
                            our presumption that the NATO commitment concerning deployment would be
                            honored and <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> said that the German
                            assumption was the same. It was certainly his intention. But if Italy
                            dropped out, it would become very difficult for the FRG. (S)</p>
                        <p>Moving on, the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said he thought Governor
                            Reagan would find the means of keeping the SALT process moving forward.
                                <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> thought this point had to be made to
                            the Soviets quickly because of their Party Congress early next year. The
                            speeches Soviet leaders made at that time could not be taken back and it
                            was important that Brezhnev should know as soon as possible that the
                            U.S. intended to continue SALT; that it was not striving for
                            superiority; but at the same time it would be second to none. In
                            response to Secretary Muskie’s observation that Senator Percy would be
                            leaving for Moscow the next day, the President said Percy would not be a
                            good messenger because he was not particularly in tune with the
                            expressed positions of the Reagan team on arms control and foreign
                                affairs.<note n="6" xml:id="d146fn6">Percy met Brezhnev in Moscow on

                                November 27, 1980, pp. A1, A7.</note> Schmidt stressed it was of
                            vital importance for the U.S. and its allies to proceed with arms
                            control in general and the SALT process in particular. There was a
                            danger that the Soviets might pull out of arms control efforts if they
                            took seriously what the Republican signals had been so far. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary Muskie</hi> suggested that Schmidt give that
                            message to the Republicans and the <hi rend="italic">President</hi>
                            added that Reagan had said during the campaign that allied leaders were
                            privately against the SALT II Treaty. <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi>
                            noted that of course that was untrue. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >President</hi> said he hoped that the Reagan administration would
                            indicate it would follow the terms of the SALT II Treaty except for the
                            dismantling schedule while it negotiated the next phase with the
                            Soviets. But he and the Chancellor agreed that it was still unclear what
                            position President-elect Reagan would take toward SALT II. <hi
                                rend="italic">Secretary Muskie</hi> added that the key question was
                            whether they would renegotiate SALT II or move on to SALT III. The
                            latter avenue would be time-consuming and difficult and it was far
                            preferable to renegotiate SALT II. In response to Schmidt’s question on
                            how long it would take to negotiate the SALT III treaty, <hi
                                rend="italic">von Staden</hi> said “years.” The <hi rend="italic"
                                >President</hi> noted that it took very little time for an American
                            administration to decide what SALT positions it would prefer, but
                            reaching agreement with the Soviets was another matter. (S)</p>
                        <p>In response to <hi rend="italic">Schmidt’</hi>s statement that the
                            Soviets must have known that SALT II would not be passed by the Senate,
                            the <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said that we had gotten the Treaty
                            out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with only minor

                            they would support the treaty at the appropriate moment, promises that
                            unsurprisingly had evaporated during the campaign. The President
                            continued that it was the Afghanistan invasion which sabotaged SALT II.
                            In any event, it would have been close as in the vote on the Panama
                            Canal Treaty but the President said he was convinced there were good
                            prospects for ratification a year ago before the Soviets moved into
                            Afghanistan. Moreover, the Carter administration was prepared to move
                            vigorously forward after the election because SALT II was a good treaty.
                                <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> strongly agreed and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Secretary Muskie</hi> expressed his conviction that SALT II would
                            have been ratified by now without Afghanistan. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> then asked about developments at the CSCE
                            Review Conference at Madrid. The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said
                            he was very pleased with the mutual support and Allied solidarity which
                            had been evidenced at the meeting. The Soviets had been embarrassed by
                            West German, U.S., UK and even some neutrals’ statements concerning the
                            invasion of Afghanistan. In sum, the Madrid meeting was moving in a
                            productive direction. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> wondered if that included the CDE, and the
                                <hi rend="italic">President</hi> said he would let the Chancellor
                            and Governor Reagan work that out. Noting that there would be an SCC
                            meeting on this question this afternoon which would help the President
                            make his decision, <hi rend="italic">Secretary Muskie</hi> said the
                            French had come a good way toward the U.S. positions. There was now no
                            Phase II disarmament phase in the proposal and Paris was stressing
                            strongly the need for CBMs that extended all the way to the Urals.
                            Deputy Secretary Christopher added that there was a timing problem and
                            the CDE would probably have to be addressed during the transition
                            period. If the Soviets tabled their proposal amidst a propaganda barrage
                            and the French followed suit, the U.S. might have to make a decision
                            during the interregnum. (S)</p>

                            their positions.<note n="8" xml:id="d146fn8">Reference to the first

                            off. <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> thought it was important in order
                            not to damage the TNF deployment decision, that European publics and
                            parliaments be convinced that the West was seriously trying to negotiate
                            on these weapons. That was very important for European psychology. The
                                <hi rend="italic">President</hi> noted that he assumed Schmidt was
                            familiar with the Soviet position. They wanted to freeze all deployments
                            and not include SS–20s outside Europe. These were the two main obstacles
                            and they were predictable Soviet positions. (S)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> then said that as he had mentioned
                            in their earlier private meeting, there was a serious possibility that
                            the Iran–Iraq war would impose a serious oil shortage in the West. The
                            IEA needed to prepare for that possibility now without actually
                            triggering any measures.<note n="9" xml:id="d146fn9">In a November 18
                                memorandum to Carter on economic aspects of Carter’s meeting with
                                Schmidt, Owen wrote that the administration was proposing joint
                                measures to the IEA “to avert sharp increases in world oil prices as
                                a result of the Iraq-Iran war” to be agreed at the IEA Ministers’
                                meeting on December 8–9, but the Germans and some other European
                                governments were resisting serious joint action. Owen encouraged
                                Carter to tell Schmidt that the United States had concluded that
                                “the IEA members should begin now to agree on a set of contingent
                                national oil-import ceilings, to be made effective as soon as the
                                ministers conclude that the market is getting out of hand.” (Carter

                            that those countries particularly hard-hit by the Iran–Iraq war would
                            have their needs met. The President said he understood that Schmidt
                            would prefer to handle the problem through pricing but there was a real
                            danger in a $15–$20 price rise if the war continued. There then ensued
                            an exchange in which Schmidt repeated several times that he was
                            skeptical about this idea. (He did not seem to understand it very well.)
                            The <hi rend="italic">Chancellor</hi> said he thought we should be able
                            to handle the problem without international regulations which would lead
                            to national regulations, which would in turn reduce the pressure on our
                            people to save energy. The only way our publics would save energy was if
                            the price went higher. Schmidt thought the crude price was bound to go
                            up to $60; the only question was when. Everything would depend on
                            Western conservation and alternate energy sources. (S)</p>

                            not our purpose. Again <hi rend="italic">Schmidt</hi> said he did not
                            believe in these arrangements. They would lead to protectionism and were
                            not appropriate for capitalist societies. Countries must be educated to
                            use less energy and that would require a price rise. However, Schmidt
                            smilingly noted that we would not run into a German veto on this both
                            because the Germans didn’t have such a veto and because they would not
                            exercise it if they did. Nonetheless, the Chancellor was convinced that
                            our people would have to suffer through high energy prices before they
                            would recognize and accept what needed to be done. (S)</p>

                            <item>Summary: I saw the Chancellor December 19 and went over with him
                                the talking points contained reftel. He listened carefully but,
                                while praising the NATO consultation process in developing measures
                                in the event of a Soviet intervention in Poland, he was essentially
                                noncommittal as to the stance which the FRG NATO PermRep would take
                                in the future in drawing up the list of economic measures. Schmidt
                                expressed concern about the “worst case” approach, saying he felt it
                                would be desirable to develop differentiated approaches geared to
                                various contingencies. He also displayed great sensitivity about
                                possibility of leaks concerning NATO consultations. He noted the
                                relatively calm situation now prevailing in Poland and feared that a
                                leak to the public of a NATO document containing a list of economic
                                countermeasures based on a “worst case” contingency would be
                                unsettling and could be seen as provocative by the Soviets. He
                                nevertheless claimed to be surprised that FRG PermRep was “reticent”
                                in NATO consultations and he asked Von Staden to follow up with the
                                Foreign Office with a view to clarifying the situation.<note n="3"

                                    19 meeting Schmidt referred to press reports of criticism by
                                    Brown and Brzezinski that West Germany’s draft 1981 defense
                                    budget would not increase by 3 percent. Schmidt stated that he
                                    found such comments “hard to understand,” given his promise to
                                    Carter that the FRG would meet the target, if needed with
                                    supplemental appropriations as in previous years. Schmidt
                                    indicated that he felt that such comments would have an “adverse
                                    psychological effect on Bundestag members” and “wondered what
                                    such comments implied about solidarity of ties between the two

                                assurance that we had not proposed action in connection with
                                inner-German trade. He added that he was grateful for the

                            <item>During my initial presentation and at several points in our
                                subsequent conversation, the Chancellor questioned me closely as to
                                our definition of “Soviet intervention” in Poland as it related to
                                NATO consultations on countermeasures. When I explained that
                                consultations were based on a “worst case” intervention scenario,
                                the Chancellor expressed concern, noting that there were many
                                variations which Soviet intervention could take, and that, in fact,
                                the “worst case” scenario probably was the least likely. He felt it
                                would be desirable to consider a differentiated list of
                                countermeasures which could be fitted to various contingencies short
                                of an outright, brutal Soviet intervention. I explained the
                                rationale for operating on a “worst case” basis and observed an
                                attempt to work out a series of measures applicable to a number of
                                different contingencies would be overly time consuming; rather, the
                                idea was to develop as broad a list as possible from which
                                governments could make decisions based on the actual circumstances
                                of intervention. The Chancellor, however, made clear that he
                                continued to be skeptical about this approach.</item>

                            <item>The Chancellor also repeatedly expressed his concern about the
                                possibility of leaks arising from the NATO consultations. He thought
                                that NATO’s record in maintaining the confidentiality of PermRep
                                discussions was not good and he commented that leaks—which sometimes
                                almost seemed deliberate—would have international political as well
                                as financial consequences. He reiterated his preference for very
                                restricted consultations and the need for every effort to be made to
                                preserve confidentiality.</item>

                            <item>The Chancellor remarked that, at a time when the situation in
                                Poland seems to have calmed down somewhat (he referred in particular
                                to the “amazing discipline” shown at the Gdansk ceremonies), it
                                would be most unfortunate if a list of economic countermeasures
                                against the Soviet Union based on a “worst case” scenario were to be
                                leaked. This would not only be unsettling but could be taken as a
                                provocation by the Soviet Union.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>In connection with leaks, I observed that there was also a
                                possibility that a leak could occur regarding the failure of
                                Alliance members to agree on measures to be taken in the event of
                                Soviet intervention and that this also could be most damaging. The
                                Chancellor did not comment, although Von Staden took note of this
                                observation.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>Speaking in general terms of the NATO consultations about Poland,
                                the Chancellor said he had welcomed the broad consensus which he
                                understood had been achieved at the last Brussels Ministerial by the
                                Defense and Foreign Ministers.<note n="6" xml:id="d147fn6">See
                                    Document 68.</note> In this regard, he remarked that he felt
                                Foreign Minister Genscher had been especially helpful. Having this
                                broad consensus in mind, the Chancellor said he was quite surprised
                                by what I had said concerning the “reticence” of the FRG PermRep
                                with regard to consultations on economic measures.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Continuing, the Chancellor said that he was pleased that, in
                                contrast to the situation regarding Afghanistan, NATO was consulting
                                in advance about contingencies which could develop in Poland. He
                                stressed again that these consultations, in his view, should embrace
                                various eventualities and should not be based on a single scenario.
                                He was pleased in general that the consultations embraced both
                                political and economic measures and he stressed that consultations
                                on such measures should be approached in a flexible spirit and
                                should not develop into a kind of dogma.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>The Chancellor said that he saw no differences in principle
                                between the US and the FRG in connection with attitude toward
                                East-West trade, although it is true that the FRG has had different
                                results from the US in this area and trade with the East plays a
                                greater role for the FRG than it does for the US. He added that
                                questions concerning economic countermeasures are obviously
                                complicated, particularly the legal aspects, and needed to be
                                considered carefully. In general, however, he wanted to be clear
                                that he had no difficulty with using economic measures for political
                                ends, but this should be done only when necessary and only in a
                                manner appropriate to the circumstances.</item>

                            <item>Von Staden remarked that he thought there had been a concensus at
                                the Quadripartite meeting in London on the contingencies which might
                                arise and the reactions to them.<note n="7" xml:id="d147fn7"

                                circumstances of Soviet moves. I said that my information on the
                                Quadripartite meeting was that, in fact, the FRG representative had
                                been most reserved about any discussion of specific economic
                                measures; as to a “triggering list,” I said this was definitely not
                                the aim of the NATO consultations. Our goal, rather, was to develop
                                a broad list which subsequently would be reviewed in capitals and
                                from which Ministers could draw in determining what actions would be
                                appropriate.</item>

                            <item>In his concluding comments, the Chancellor said he wished to note
                                that it was not his style to make loud pronouncements about actions
                                to be taken in the future which subsequently are not fulfilled. He
                                recalled in strong terms the question of the Olympic boycott and the
                                fact that in the end the FRG had stood with the US on this question.
                                He said that he wished to be known as a person who does not give his
                                word easily, but when he does he fulfills his commitment.</item>

                            <item>I thanked the Chancellor for his comments and his time and
                                repeated our hope that the FRG PermRep could be given more latitude
                                to discuss specific economic countermeasures in the event of Soviet
                                intervention in Poland in accordance with the mandate from the
                                Foreign Ministers. The Chancellor requested Von Staden to follow up
                                on this matter with the Foreign Office to clarify the situation and
                                said he was pleased that I would be talking with the Foreign
                                Minister.</item>
                            <label>15.</label>
                            <item>In a subsequent conversation with Von Staden after we had left the
                                Chancellor’s office, he referred to the paragraph in my talking
                                points indicating that the problem “goes beyond the situation in
                                Poland and relates directly to the overall international behavior of
                                the Soviet Union.” Since he understood that the mandate of the
                                Foreign Ministers to the PermReps had in fact been directly related
                                to Poland, he said he was puzzled by this passage. I said I felt it
                                should be taken to mean that a Soviet intervention in Poland should
                                not be viewed by the West as an isolated event but should be seen in
                                the context of a pattern of behavior, including the invasion of
                                Afghanistan, the Soviet arms buildup, etc.</item>

                            <item>Comment: Although personally cordial, the Chancellor was obviously
                                rushed and a bit testy. During our conversation, he spoke mostly in
                                German, which is unusual in our talks. While he made no definite
                                commitment as to instructions to the FRG PermRep, I believe it was
                                useful to see him and I feel that the report of my demarche should
                                have an impact on the Foreign Office.</item>

                                to talk to Vice President and he only regretted time available to
                                the [visit] was so short. He had read Vice President’s remarks
                                before NATO Council and had found them stimulating. Iceland, he
                                noted, has a special problem because of its strategic position;
                                Winston Churchill had described it as the QTE lifeline of the
                                Atlantic UNQTE, and to some extent Iceland was during World War II.
                                Iceland also has to cope with growing interest in it of Soviet
                                Union. It does not want to QTE fall behind the Soviet frontiers
                                UNQTE or under Soviet influence. He said his government had made it
                                clear that Iceland is a NATO member; he believes confirmation of
                                Iceland’s security as well as that of NATO lies in Iceland’s defense

                            <item>Prime Minister then said that defense agreement and Iceland’s NATO
                                membership nevertheless remain issues in Icelandic politics. They
                                are issues that are fought in every national election. They will
                                have to be fought again next year, and he hoped it would again be
                                possible to confirm Iceland’s commitment to NATO and support of the
                                defense agreement with the U.S. He recalled in passing that previous
                                government had asked for gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from
                                Iceland. Vice President had referred to 1974 Memorandum of
                                Understanding. That agreement stipulated that U.S. and GOI should
                                try to separate military and civilian operation at Keflavik. Prime
                                Minister said he regarded this as QTE very essential UNQTE in order
                                to cope with problems associated with having foreign troops
                                stationed in small country. Sooner this separation could be effected
                                through planned construction of new civilian air terminal the
                                better. He would therefore appreciate it if USG could take the
                                initiative in bringing the matter of a U.S. financial contribution
                                to the construction of a new terminal to attention of those who must
                                make the decision.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Vice President asked whether agreement had been reached for U.S.
                                to help finance construction of terminal. Ambassador Blake said we
                                had agreed in the MOU of 1974 to study how we might cooperate in
                                construction of a new terminal and this matter was still under
                                review in Washington. Admiral Bernstein noted that we were
                                sympathetic to the idea of covering defense-related facilities of
                                any new terminal, such as ramps and possibly helping in construction
                                of a separate access road so that the movement of passengers to and
                                from the new terminal would be completely outside military
                                operational area. Prime Minster said U.S. had agreed to construct
                                new air terminal ramps; what he was raising now was the importance
                                of some U.S. financial contribution to construction of terminal
                                building itself. Background of this request was that many Icelanders
                                claimed IDF was here only in interest of U.S. defense, not
                                Iceland’s. His government’s answer was that this was true, but that
                                Iceland also benefitted from IDF presence. The Vice President
                                interjected that he hoped GOI would view IDF presence in that
                                light.</item>

                            <item>Prime Minister then said that during cod war U.K. did not respect
                                Iceland’s fisheries jurisdiction. We were lucky, he said, that no
                                lives were lost. If any had been lost, he was not sure his
                                government would have been able to maintain its NATO membership and
                                adhere to the defense agreement with the U.S. When NATO SYG Luns
                                visited Iceland, he described Iceland publicly as QTE vital to
                                NATO’s interests UNQTE and as a country whose loss to NATO would
                                cost the American taxpayer large sums of money for additional
                                aircraft carriers. Prime Minister said he did not RPT not think this
                                was a QTE very clever UNQTE statement by Luns since Iceland does not
                                want to put a price tag on itself and to do so would encourage other
                                countries to do the same. Luns, statement had led to discussion
                                within Iceland as to whether GOI should treat NATO base as Spain
                                treats the American bases there, as subject to lease payments. Prime
                                Minister said he opposes this; Iceland has an agreement with the
                                U.S. based on reciprocal and mutual interests. He was not asking for
                                financial assistance in the construction of the terminal because he
                                thought U.S. ought to pay for the facilities it has at Keflavik. He
                                was asking because he believes the early separation of the military
                                and civilian facilities would result in smoother running of the
                                base; smoother relations between the military and civilian elements

                                Minister toward landlord-lessee arrangements. Such arrangements
                                always led to debates over how much something was worth and
                                relations became QTE poisoned UNQTE. The American people don’t like
                                such relationships and react emotionally against them. He personally
                                would dislike seeing the U.S. presence in Iceland based on any other
                                arrangements than those the Prime Minister described as preferable.
                                He said he would make certain that the matters raised by the Prime
                                Minister would be given attention at Washington level they clearly
                                should have.</item>

                            <item>Prime Minister responded by assuring Vice President that USG had
                                not RPT not been unresponsive; what is needed now, he said, is
                                progress on discussions that have already been held. He would like
                                to have it understood that Iceland is not putting a price tag on its
                                cooperation. What he would like is for it to be understood that the
                                presence of a defense force, which Iceland cannot support out of its
                                own resources, entails expenses which a country of 220,000 should
                                not be asked to carry on its own. Construction of a new civilian air
                                terminal is clearly needed to replace the old and limited facilities
                                of the present one which are shared with the military. This is the
                                kind of expense resulting from Iceland’s cooperation with the U.S.
                                which he hoped the USG would understand and help GOI to
                                cover.<lb/>Prime Minister assured Vice President GOI was very
                                pleased with relations with the U.S. which had become an
                                increasingly important market for its fish and fish products. He was
                                pleased to see that USG would soon extend its fisheries jurisdiction

                        <p>As directed by the National Security Council, an interagency working
                            group has conducted a comprehensive study of U.S. assistance to Iceland.
                            The central question before the U.S. Government is how to respond to
                            Icelandic requests for assistance—both those already tabled and those
                            that may develop in the future. The purpose of the attached study<note

                            Icelandic proposals. Interagency action is, of course, underway on the

                        <p>Iceland’s membership in NATO and the presence of a U.S.-manned NATO
                            military facility at Keflavik (whose personnel are known as the Iceland
                            Defense Force—IDF) form the basis for the assistance requests. A
                            bilateral defense agreement was signed in 1951 wherein the United
                            States, on behalf of NATO, agreed to develop the facilities at Keflavik
                            and provide personnel for the IDF. Since that time, the Keflavik complex
                            has served Western defense and continued to furnish essential
                            intelligence data otherwise unavailable. The retention of our military

                        <p>In 1974, the U.S. concluded a Memorandum of Understanding with Iceland
                            which provided for the continuation of the 1951 agreement and committed
                            us to assist in certain specific projects and study further cooperation

                        <p>The Icelandic Government has indicated several priority areas it
                            considers appropriate for U.S. assistance—civil aviation, including the
                            training of personnel and the improvement of airport facilities, the
                            provision of vessels for the Icelandic Coast Guard and adoption by the
                            base of a geothermal heating system.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications for the U.S.</p>
                        <p>General responsiveness to Icelandic assistance requests will help
                            maintain or improve an atmosphere conducive to the continued functioning
                            of the Keflavik facilities. Failure to respond could have the opposite
                            effect. Whatever our decision, it is clear that we will never secure
                            guaranteed tenure for the base. On the other hand, a refusal to satisfy
                            reasonable Icelandic requests could stimulate demands for a closure of
                            the base or Icelandic withdrawal from NATO. Any action on our part that
                            could precipitate such a reaction from the Icelanders before we had the
                            opportunity to re-examine and implement a contingency plan for
                            relocating these important facilities with a minimum of operational
                            interruption would be decidedly unwise. Our objective remains pursuit of
                            a political environment in Iceland favorable to keeping the Keflavik
                            facilities at the lowest possible cost.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Legal Obligation</p>
                        <p>No agreement in force between the United States and Iceland commits the
                            United States to furnish economic or military assistance to Iceland with
                            the exception of paragraph 5 of the 1974 Memorandum of Understanding
                            which calls for the upgrading of Keflavik airfield to ICAO Category II
                            standards subject to the availability of appropriated funds.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of some legal obligation other than that cited above to
                            furnish either economic or military assistance to Iceland, whether or
                            not to seek to do so becomes an entirely political decision. The
                            agreements relating to our facilities in Iceland and Article 3 of the
                            North Atlantic Treaty nevertheless offer a partial basis upon which to
                            justify such assistance (especially to Congress) insofar as assistance
                            could be pointed to as being not only consistent with those agreements
                            but in furtherance of the cooperative and mutually beneficial
                            relationship which they evince.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Policy Conclusion</p>
                        <p>The following options were developed:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Option 1</hi>: Furnish no assistance whatsoever except
                            that which may coincidentally result from USG projects routinely

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Suboption</hi>: (To be exercised in addition to but not
                            instead of the main option) Seek to broaden the financial
                            responsibilities of maintaining the NATO facility at Keflavik by asking
                            Allies to share costs for defense-related assistance over and above
                            routine operating and maintenance expenses.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Option 3</hi>: Attempt to meet Icelandic requests,
                            whether agreement-related or not, which can be judged to improve the
                            atmosphere for the base.</p>
                        <p>The members of the interagency working group conclude that, in light of
                            the fundamental, unchanged tenets of our policy toward Iceland and the
                            political situation existing in Iceland today, the USG would best appear
                            to achieve its primary objective—retention of the U.S.-manned facilities
                            at Keflavik—through pursuit of Option 2 and its sub-option. This is
                            essentially a political decision designed to create an atmosphere
                            conducive to continued defense cooperation with the Icelandic Government
                            consistent with the 1974 MOU and Agreed Minute. Promotion of an ongoing
                            U.S. military presence at Keflavik, with all that entails in terms of
                            American and Allied security interests, could thus become a source of
                            mutual benefit and satisfaction rather than a periodic irritant in
                            U.S.–Icelandic relations.</p>

                        <p>The United States has a continuing stake in the NATO facility at
                            Keflavik. At issue is how to respond to periodic Icelandic requests for
                            financial assistance so that we may protect that stake. That issue was
                            the subject of an inter-agency review during the previous
                            administration, a copy of which is attached, covered by a summary
                            memorandum from the Acting Secretary of State.<note n="2"

                        <p>As you know, during the Vice President’s stop-over in Iceland, the Prime
                            Minister asked us for a financial contribution to the construction of a
                            new civilian air terminal at Keflavik. The request raises a somewhat
                            different issue. It would not fall within the guideline recommended by
                            the inter-agency group and is being studied separately.</p>

                            appropriate instruction to the Secretaries of State and Defense.
                            Individual Icelandic requests will then be examined against that
                                guideline.<note n="4" xml:id="d261fn4">Carter approved the
                                recommendation, and wrote “but we might interpret liberally on

                            United States, since there were hundreds of thousands of Norwegians in
                            the United States; there had been U.S. support for Norway during the
                            war; and cooperation between the two countries ever since. Feelings are
                            strong in Norway towards the United States.</p>

                            He hoped the Vice President could visit Norway.</p>

                            nations of Europe, including Norway. He wants to provide assistance to
                            Norway, and to consult with the Prime Minister at any time. Looking to
                            the visit of the Vice President, we should decide how best to use the
                            visit.</p>

                            the situation of a little nation that is allied to one superpower, and a
                            neighbor of the other. Therefore in their foreign policy, they try to
                            take care to preserve low tensions, and the right balance.</p>

                            sovereignty over the area could perhaps avoid that. Spitzbergen was
                            never a place for Norway of gaining money. Vacations were about all.
                            They were paying 30 crowns per ton (?); and were putting in a billion

                            to let him know. Norway is of great value to the United States. We want
                            to do nothing to disturb it. The Prime Minister should not be timid.</p>

                            He told me that Norway has a number of issues outstanding with the
                            Soviet Union such as fishing and mineral rights disputes and a wide
                            range of issues relating to Spitzbergen. He said that the prospects for
                            their settlement depend in some measure on the general East–West
                            atmosphere. Frydenlund pointed out that the Soviets would obviously like
                            to settle many of these Northern Flank issues in a bilateral “package
                            deal” between the Soviet Union and Norway. Norway, on the other hand,
                            wants to keep the issues on the Western side multilateralized.</p>

                                generally stable throughout the post-war era, but which also is
                                characterized by underlying forces eroding the security and
                                confidence of the Nordic states. Triggered by the huge preponderance
                                in Soviet regional military power, this erosive process has been fed
                                by weak Scandinavian governments, economic problems and growing
                                feelings of insecurity. In recent years, the dispute over Svalbard
                                and the mineral-rich Arctic seabed has taken on growing importance.
                                Recent Soviet heavy-handedness has led to some stiffening of Nordic
                                will. While Soviet military superiority on the Northern Flank is
                                beyond doubt, it should prove possible to sustain the overall
                                political status quo and stability it has generated for Northern
                                Europe.”</note> The back half of the paper offers some tentative

                        <p>US interests are best served by strongly supporting Norwegian sovereignty
                            over the Svalbards, while taking account of the Soviet interest in
                            maintaining access for its Northern Fleet to the Atlantic. We should
                            seek to ensure that Norway resists both Soviet pressures to resolve
                            Svalbard issues bilaterally and encroachment westward in the boundary
                            dispute. Arms control negotiations, involving constraints on regional
                            military activities, also may be worth consideration to supplement such
                            a security modus vivendi.</p>
                        <p>While maintaining a reservation with respect to shelf resource rights, we
                            are exploring with Norway and other allies the possibility of a
                            practical economic development regime for the Svalbard shelf. It may
                            prove feasible to find a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> “higher
                            consensus” corresponding to US, Norwegian, allied, and Soviet interests,
                            perhaps without negotiations with Moscow. If the allied consensus we
                            have been developing along these lines erodes in the future or runs into
                            serious Soviet resistance, it may be necessary to consider an
                            alternative US position. One approach might be exclusive Norwegian
                            control over the shelf area with suitable bilaterally-agreed guarantees
                            for future American access to shelf resources. Alternatively, the
                            parties might prove more amenable to a regime defined by
                            “multiple-bilateral” agreements (with the Norwegian sovereign) than by

                                given careful consideration.” In a February 13 memorandum to Brown
                                and Vance, Brzezinski noted that he understood that Brown would
                                consult with Congress and asked them to “forward a joint

                                    in time of crisis. Our military finds utility in that

                                <item>Icelandic politics are again at a critical juncture, with
                                    Prime Minister Hallgrimsson’s essentially pro-U.S. government
                                    facing elections in June. Of course, no particular action on our
                                    part is likely to be decisive, especially not over any long
                                    term. But I believe providing assistance would be worth doing as
                                    insurance with regard to a facility that is critical to our
                                    security, especially in a time of Soviet buildup in the Northern
                                    Fleet.</item>

                        <p>With your assent, we would tell the Icelanders we were prepared to
                            provide assistance with exact amount and term to be negotiated, and of
                            course contingent on eventual Congressional approval. Preliminary
                            soundings on the Hill about MILCON funding were reasonably promising, if
                            vague because any actual request would still be several budgets away.
                            You should note AID Director Gilligan’s dissent from using SSA funds

                        <p>In the light of your recent decision we wish to submit a revised proposal
                            for your consideration. We are greatly concerned that if the US is not
                            in some way responsive to the repeated Icelandic pleas on the air
                            terminal, we risk adverse consequences out of all proportion to the
                            costs involved (our original proposal is attached at Tab 2<note n="4"

                        <p>As you know, the Keflavik base in Iceland occupies a unique strategic
                            location from which the US and NATO can ensure early warning and conduct
                            surveillance of Soviet air and naval activities emanating from Soviet
                            northern bases. The importance of the Icelandic facilities has increased
                            as the Soviets continue to expand their strategic forces. Should we ever
                            be forced to leave Keflavik, no alternatives exist to maintain
                            comparable intelligence coverage and estimated costs for relocation to
                            recapture even some of the lost coverage are extraordinarily expensive.
                            The intangible price in political and strategic terms would be
                            incalculable.</p>
                        <p>In 1974, during a change of government in Iceland, we were threatened
                            with closure of the facilities unless we renegotiated the terms of our
                            presence. One of the provisions of the resultant 1974 Memorandum of
                            Understanding (MOU)<note n="5" xml:id="d268fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d259fn4">footnote 4, Document 259</ref>.</note>
                            reaffirmed our longstanding commitment to pursue a complete separation
                            of military and civilian facilities in the base/airport area. However,
                            international travelers or Icelandic citizens must still pass through a
                            terminal also used by US forces as well as a checkpoint at the base
                            perimeter. Sharing facilities is regarded by Icelanders as an
                            infringement on their national sovereignty. The present Government of
                            Iceland would not hesitate to invoke the renegotiation Article again
                            should the base become a significant factor during the election campaign
                            and we have no doubt that any regime in Iceland would seriously consider
                            this legal option. The result would probably be either to terminate the
                            US presence in Iceland, or to raise the cost of remaining well above
                            current and proposed “quids.”</p>
                        <p>In addition to stressing complete separation of facilities at the time
                            the new proposal was submitted, the Foreign Minister also reiterated
                            that the Icelandic Government could not afford to proceed with the
                            project without external assistance and cited Iceland’s small population
                            (220,000), narrow tax base and hard-pressed national treasury. We
                            believe that the terminal project is well beyond the modest capabilities
                            of Iceland, whose 1977 national budget totaled approximately $500
                            million.</p>
                        <p>Not only does the new proposal enjoy the unqualified support of the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff and the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, but the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize a contingency wartime military
                            requirement for the proposed project which could be used by our armed
                            forces as an operations/command center or medical facility to support US
                            reinforcements.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Northern Flank of Europe is of growing importance because of
                            the expanding Soviet presence on the Kola Peninsula. The Scandinavians
                            are concerned about this, and any action which would jeopardize our
                            ability to meet that threat would add to those concerns.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                        <p>We propose to drop the $15 million Security Supporting Assistance (SSA)
                            portion of our original recommendation in favor of an absolute maximum
                            contribution of $20 million to be funded from the Defense Department’s
                            Military Construction (MILCON) program. Although significant in per
                            capita terms in Iceland, $20 million is relatively little when compared
                            to the cost which would be incurred if we are restricted in our
                            Iceland-based operations. The political environment in Iceland remains
                            unstable and we believe that we should not risk losing the Keflavik
                            facilities in this period of expanding Soviet naval power.</p>
                        <p>A positive decision “in principle” would allow us to negotiate the most
                            favorable terms for a US contribution with the Icelanders (this would
                            not involve actual expenditure until approximately 1981). Moreover a
                            single source of funding without the SSA portion would facilitate
                            subsequent justification to the Congress. In any event, although
                            Congressional approval cannot be presumed, we believe a very strong case
                            can be made on national security grounds to the appropriate
                            Congressional Committees.</p>
                        <p>We hope that you will be able to receive us for a brief meeting on this
                            revised proposal.<note n="6" xml:id="d268fn6">On April 28, Carter met

                                Brown, Brzezinski informed them that Carter had approved their
                                proposal. He wrote: “The President agrees to your proposal to drop

                        <p>Sweden wants to purchase U.S. jet engine technology to use in future
                            military aircraft. The proposed jet engine program under review
                            envisages eventual production in Sweden of the entire engine or at least
                            major engine components. Approval of such a program would require that
                            you determine a policy exception to the arms transfer policy guidelines
                            you issued on May 19, 1977.<note n="2" xml:id="d269fn2">Reference is to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Discussion</p>
                        <p>Sweden is developing an attack/trainer aircraft called the B3LA as one of
                            two follow-ons to the Viggen and is considering three engines to power
                            this aircraft: a 10,000 pound thrust (non-afterburning) version of the
                            General Electric (GE) 404 engine, which will power the F–18; the 14,500
                            pound thrust (non-afterburning) version of the Pratt and Whitney
                            (P&amp;W) F–100 engine, which is operational and powers the F–15 and
                            F–16; and the British Turbounion RB–199 engine, which powers the
                            FRG/UK/Italy TORNADO. The Navy model of the GE 404 engine is scheduled
                            for certification in mid-1979, with production in early 1980; the F–18
                            is due to become operational in March 1981. Both U.S. engines are “major
                            defense equipment” and, under Section 38 (b) (3) of the Arms Export
                            Control Act, any sale of $7 million or more to Sweden would have to be
                            made under Foreign Military Sales procedures.</p>
                        <p>Sweden has been given technical data to evaluate the GE 404 and P&amp;W
                            F–100. To make fundamental decisions on the B3LA program, the Swedish
                            Defense Minister now wants to know whether these engines will be made
                            available by the U.S. for development and eventual coproduction in
                            Sweden. The Defense Department expects that production in Sweden will
                            not exceed 35–40 percent of the component parts of the engine selected.
                            Approval of coproduction of this engine will be the first such exception
                            under your arms control policy for a sophisticated, high technology

                                Norway, Denmark, and Finland combined. It maintains an air force of
                                500 combat aircraft, just slightly less than the United States Air
                                Force in Europe, but with a much higher sortie rate than the

                                the sub-continent and the fact that we would not sell equivalent

                                    11 memorandum to Carter, Vance informed him that he had decided
                                    to deny Sweden’s request to sell Viggen aircraft to India.

                                    because of our own Congressional laws and restraint policy. It
                                    won’t win the competition, won’t decide whether India gets a

                                    diddly-squat in terms of ‘stability,’ etc. Somehow, we have to

                                both the current coalition government and the Icelandic opposition
                                are basically quite satisfied with the current state of US–Icelandic

                            <item>Second, the NATO relationship and the Keflavik base which is
                                always a somewhat touchy political issue among Iceland’s
                                anti-militaristic population, are fundamentally sound and in better
                                shape than in the past. Johannesson’s coalition, which includes the
                                People’s Alliance Communist Party, has to proceed carefully.
                                Nonetheless, Johannesson made a point of saying that his government
                                supports the NATO presence at Keflavik and that Iceland’s
                                fundamental policy in foreign affairs and in particular its
                                commitment to the Atlantic Alliance remains unchanged. Hallgrimsson,
                                whose opposition Independence Party is more pro-NATO, was, of
                                course, strong in his support of NATO and our presence at
                                Keflavik.</item>

                                government should be able to provide us with the information we
                                require if there is to be a line item in the 81 budget. Of
                                importance both Johannesson and Hallgrimsson expressed a degree of
                                frustration over the fact that they cannot provide the people of
                                Iceland with a fuller picture of Soviet military activities in the
                                North Atlantic, a picture which would cause the Icelanders to have a
                                better appreciation of Keflavik’s importance. They noted that they
                                receive briefings from our Ambassador and base commander but that
                                because of the classified information involved, they cannot make use
                                of it in their Parliament or press. I believe it would be very
                                useful if State and Defense were to look into this problem as a
                                matter of priority and to come up with more information that can be
                                declassified on Soviet air and sea activities in the region and the
                                importance of Keflavik to the Atlantic Alliance.<note n="5"

                            <item>Civil aviation is the one real point of concern to both the
                                government and the opposition. Iceland’s airline, Loftleidir, which
                                for years flourished because of its cut-rate fares took a terrible
                                financial beating last year with the new “open sky” low fares of
                                other Atlantic carriers. The Icelanders are very worried that the
                                airline may go under if it cannot find ways to develop more
                                revenues. The government is formulating proposals. Without
                                commitment I told the Prime Minister that we would give his
                                proposals close and careful attention as soon as they are

                                the Danes have no power plant of their own—in part because they have
                                not solved the problem of what to do with waste storage—they have
                                been and continue to debate the pros and cons of nuclear power; and
                                the Swedes have located one of their nuclear power plants
                                immediately across the Oresund Strait from Copenhagen. I reviewed

                                fact, on all common issues of concern. Norwegians are not known for

                                stimulated by Prime Minister Ecevit’s recent visit to Oslo. Nordli
                                underlined his government’s view of Ecevit’s need for economic help.
                                He noted that he had just received a message from the Turkish Prime
                                Minister proposing a barter of Norwegian oil for Turkish

                                assistance and I emphasized the importance to Americans of related

                                NATO. They are very strong and very up front about it. The Soviets
                                continue to harass them, including recent protests with regard to
                                prepositioning and NATO activities generally, as well as pressure
                                for bilateral consultations on Svalbard. The Norwegians are strongly
                                resisting all of this, they are confident of their stance, and value
                                our close consultations and partnership.</item>

                                authority in its territory. There was the hint that if they are

                            <item>As are many European leaders, Nordli expressed concern about
                                unemployment in the Nordic area—in fact, in the OECD
                                community—inflation and the energy challenge. We had a good exchange
                                on this. The Norwegians asked if it might not be possible to open a
                                better dialogue between the OPEC countries and the consumers with a
                                view to reaching agreement on gradual rather than abrupt and
                                disrupting price rises. I said we would examine this and be back to

                            <item>Given the lack of contentious issues in our relationship, the
                                press decided to focus on the hypothetical question of Norwegian oil
                                for Israel and pressure or lack thereof from the U.S. In a
                                restricted session with me, the Prime Minister proposed we say that
                                the Norwegians had, in fact, raised this issue; that they had noted
                                that Norwegian oil was under private control and sold without
                                discrimination and, at present, there are limited quantities; that
                                I, in turn, had referred to the U.S. guarantee of oil to Israel and
                                that I had not suggested that this was a pressing problem. The
                                Norwegians are fully willing to explore a multilateral consortium
                                for Israel. I recommend that Cy, Zbig and the concerned agencies
                                forward recommendations to you on whether or not we should pursue
                                this approach.</item>

                            <item>Nordli, in this restricted session, noted the challenge the Finns
                                face and the skill with which they meet it. He emphasized the care
                                the Nordics take to consult and to assist Finland, and he included
                                “so called neutral Sweden” in this process. He said the cooperation
                                of the Nordic countries is vital to Finland although the Finns can
                                never say so.</item>

                                two ago he had tried to enlist our support for a program of
                                international cooperation on nuclear safety. I said I would pass

                                efforts to reach the earliest possible agreement. The April 19
                                Swedish radio and newspapers had carried reports of Brezhnev’s
                                wobbly performance the day before. Ullsten twice said that should
                                you want a third country site for a summit with Brezhnev you would
                                be very welcome to Stockholm. I said I would relay the
                                invitation.</item>

                                Swedes think we should be moving harder and faster in all fields of
                                arms control and disarmament—e.g., CTB, no TNF modernization,
                                greater restriction of use of conventional weapons including land
                                mines, incendiary weapons and banning all new categories of atomic
                                weapons. In replying, I noted the steady growth of the Soviet
                                defense budget, the growth of Soviet theater nuclear forces and our
                                requirement, together with our NATO partners, to manage arms control
                                negotiations in a way that would not give the Soviets a unilateral

                                and the problems the Arab rejectionists may cause. I went over the
                                steps you had taken to bring about the Camp David Accords and the
                                Egypt–Israeli treaty, underlining that the only alternative we had
                                seen to this process was the likelihood of a new war. Ullsten and
                                his colleagues said they would continue to support your efforts.
                                This lead to a discussion of your energy policy, for which there is

                                Kekkenon is still very much running the show here (although he
                                relies rather heavily on Ministry briefing papers, reading many of
                                them clearly for the first time). Overriding this is Finland’s
                                interest in a good relationship with the U.S. and in this context,

                        <p>The key factor in the evolving situation in northern Europe is the keener
                            recognition by both East and West of the growing importance of their
                            respective interests in the area. From the Soviets’ viewpoint, the area
                            has always been of major importance, and its strategic dimension has
                            been increased by the buildup of their naval ballistic missile force.
                            The area’s economic resources—particularly oil, minerals, and fish—loom
                            ever larger with the prolongation of energy shortages and the worldwide
                            constriction of fishing rights.</p>
                        <p>Because of the importance of these interests and the difficulty of
                            reconciling them when and where they collide, both sides have been
                            increasingly sensitive to possible threats to their positions in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Typical of the resulting strains are the dispute between Norway and the
                            USSR over the continental shelf boundary in the Barents Sea that
                            culminated in the establishment in 1977 of overlapping 200-mile
                            exclusive economic zones; the disagreements between the two countries
                            over the exercise of Norwegian sovereignty in Svalbard; the uproar in
                            Norway last year over Soviet intrusions into northern Norwegian waters;
                            the Soviet proposal in July 1978 that neutral Finland and the USSR hold
                            joint military exercises; and moves by both Norway and Denmark in the
                            last few years to upgrade their military ties with NATO.</p>
                        <p>The growing political, economic, and military engagement in the area that
                            these developments reflect is bound to continue. Moreover, it may take
                            place in a climate of still greater uncertainty about the short-term
                            intentions and perceptions of both sides—and of still greater complexity
                            in the reciprocal interplay of the moves that each may make.</p>
                        <p>The complex question of Svalbard may prove impossible to resolve, not
                            only because of the vagueness of the Spitzbergen Treaty<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d276fn3">Reference is to the Treaty Relating to Spitzbergen,
                                which was signed on February 9, 1920.</note> (which established
                            Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago), but also because of the
                            conflicting interests of the USSR, Norway, and the other 38 signatories
                            of the treaty. Even if Norway and the USSR should sort out their
                            differences on overlapping economic zones in the Barents Sea, fisheries
                            disputes in those waters will occur from time to time.</p>
                        <p>The introduction of offshore oil rigs into the Norwegian and Barents Seas
                            will be a complicating factor. It will further extend the Western
                            presence—both economic and technological for the exploitation of
                            resources, and military and political for their defense.</p>
                        <p>In the context of the growing strategic importance it attaches to its
                            northern access to the Atlantic and its long-term goal of establishing
                            hegemony in the region, the USSR will look suspiciously on this greater
                            Western involvement. For their part, the Nordic states will pay close
                            attention to Soviet military and naval dispositions and will not be
                            reluctant to ring the tocsin if they think support from NATO is lagging
                            behind their expanding interests or is failing to respond to increases
                            in Soviet pressure.</p>
                        <p>Changes in leadership in and outside the area will introduce still other
                            uncertainties. A key component in the region’s overall balance has been
                            Finland’s ability under President Kekkonen to adjust to changing Soviet
                            leaders and policies without further compromising a neutrality that is
                            already heavily qualified. How Kekkonen—approaching 80—is replaced and
                            by whom will invite even closer Soviet attention, and Helsinki’s skill
                            in reassuring Moscow is certain to be tested.</p>
                        <p>There is also a succession problem in Moscow. Northern Europe heretofore
                            has largely escaped the brunt of the policy shifts that have followed
                            previous changes in the Kremlin, but it now occupies a higher place in
                            the Soviet consciousness. Soviet interest in the region is unlikely to
                            decline in the post-Brezhnev period, and it is possible the Soviets will
                            pursue their objectives more assertively when a new leadership is in
                            place.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore likely that the assumptions on which Nordic security have
                            rested will be more rigorously tested in the years ahead.</p>
                        <p>Characteristically, the assertion of national interests in the area has
                            so far fallen short of direct challenge to the regional military and
                            political balance, and reasons for restraint will probably be operative
                            in the future. The Nordic states realize that their national interests
                            cannot be pursued without regard to the interests of the superpowers.
                            Both the United States and the USSR have more vital interests elsewhere,
                            and both recognize that the situation that prevails in the northern area
                            cannot be totally divorced from the global relationship that they wish
                            to have with each other.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, it is evident that Moscow’s economic and military stake in
                            that area is of sufficient import that it will hope to shape that
                            situation more favorably to its interests.</p>
                        <p>It will watch for and protest any signs of a greater NATO presence in the
                            area, whether through the introduction of non-Nordic troops, larger or
                            more frequent military and naval exercises in the Norwegian and Baltic
                            Seas, or more active efforts by Norway and Denmark to enhance their
                            defense and NATO roles. And it will press for advantage, hoping not only
                            to get its way on the immediate points at issue, but also in due course
                            to achieve a more pliant Nordic grouping.</p>
                        <p>How determinedly Moscow will assert itself in the area will depend on the
                            response it gets. The blend of the nonprovocative and the firm with
                            which the Nordic countries have defended their interests has heretofore
                            rested in part on the assumption that the northern regions were somewhat
                            peripheral to the major interests of East and West. As this becomes
                            progressively less so, the more important ingredient in the Nordics’
                            security policies will of necessity be confidence—confidence that,
                            should Moscow mistake a low profile for weakness, their resistance will
                            ultimately engage the broader Western interest.</p>
                        <p>We do not see signs that Nordic confidence is seriously eroding, but how
                            to sustain this confidence is obviously an element that should be
                            included in overall calculations of the adequacy of NATO’s military
                            posture.</p>

                            <item>Summary: Chargé consulted with Norwegian State Secretary Holst on
                                January 3 concerning possible responses to Soviet invasion of
                                Afghanistan. Holst indicated that the GON was still considering
                                appropriate and effective responses. He felt it important that the
                                USG not back away from commitment to SALT ratification and generally
                                seemed to favor carefully conceived responses, ones which hopefully
                                would “hurt” the Soviets without imperiling basic Western interests.
                                Despite an expressed aversion to linkage, Holst personally thought
                                that playing the China card might prove necessary. The only other
                                specific he touched on was the possible boycott of the Moscow
                                Olympics which, he said could be “counterproductive.” End

                            <item>Holst responded initially by saying that, in attempting to deal
                                with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, we must first attempt to
                                understand Soviet intentions. Clearly, he said, the Soviet action
                                constituted a flagrant violation of the rules of the game as the
                                West sees them (or would want them to be). However, these were not
                                necessarily rules which the Soviets accepted. This of course did not
                                justify Soviet actions, but being aware of a possible difference in
                                perception was important in dealing with the Soviet action.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Obviously, Holst said, Norway, as a small country bordering the
                                Soviet Union, was particularly concerned about the course of events
                                in Afghanistan. The Norwegians, he said, were asking themselves if
                                the Russians were now contending the right to freely intervene in
                                the affairs of smaller neighbors outside of “their immediate sphere
                                of interest in Eastern Europe.” Whatever the answers to these
                                questions, in Holst’s view, it was necessary that the US (and the
                                West) take steps designed to “hurt” the Soviet Union; these steps
                                must not, however, hurt us. As an example, he said that it would be
                                inappropriate to encourage American business to cut off relations
                                with the Russians if only to be replaced by French or German
                                business interests.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Another question very much on Holst’s mind was the nature of USG
                                goals. Specifically, he asked whether the US hoped to limit the
                                geographic focus of possible action to the Afghanistan area or was
                                Washington likely to attempt to resurrect a policy of linkage which
                                would place Afghanistan in the broader and general context of
                                East/West relations. Holst said that he himself was of two minds on
                                this subject and had not yet reached a conclusion. He added,
                                however, that he believed it would be much more difficult to gain
                                public support for and understanding of a more generalized reaction
                                in the wider East/West context.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The Chargé asked Holst if in fact he was assuming that there was
                                little to be done outside of oral protestations. He emphasized to
                                Holst that the Russians most certainly did know the rules of the
                                game and had clearly known that Afghanistan, like Finland, was a
                                state where well-established and mutually-accepted restraint
                                governed activity on both sides. We understood this, said the
                                Chargé, and so did they. Holst responded by arguing that perhaps the
                                Russians had made different calculations based on recent
                                developments in Afghanistan. He pointed out that previous Soviet

                                West. In effect, Holst said, the Soviets may have thought that we
                                had acquiesced in such activities. If this was so, perhaps the
                                Russians felt they were running an acceptable risk, one which would
                                not necessarily imperil the process of detente or their relations
                                with the West.</item>

                            <item>Although he had not yet considered the specific actions which the
                                United States was considering, Holst did make some general
                                observations. First, he said that it was clear the Soviets would
                                best understand an action which revolved around power politics
                                (although not necessarily an armed power display). Such an action,
                                he personally thought, might very well be to “play the China card.”
                                Clearly, he saw Secretary Brown’s pending visit to Beijing as an
                                opportunity in this regard.<note n="5" xml:id="d277fn5">From January
                                    5 to 13, Brown visited China. (Fox Butterfield, “Brown Impressed

                                when he discussed the China card, he realized that this might
                                possibly involve arms sales to China. On the subject of a possible
                                boycott of the Olympics, Holst’s initial reaction was negative. He
                                pointed out that no similar actions had been taken in 1956 after the
                                Hungarian invasion nor in 1968 after Czechoslovakia. Moreover, in
                                Holst’s view, there were many (at least in Norway) who had a great
                                interest in sports and only a modest interest in politics; taking
                                away their show might prove to be counterproductive.</item>

                            <item>Finally, Holst emphasized that the Norwegian Government was
                                greatly concerned about the possibility that the US Government, in
                                reaction to Afghanistan, might shelve its current efforts to obtain
                                ratification of SALT II. He understood, he said, that the
                                environment in which the treaty would now be considered would be
                                substantially altered by the Russian incursion, but felt that it
                                would be a great mistake if the government itself backed away from
                                active support of the treaty. The Chargé assured Holst that the USG
                                remained committed to moving the SALT treaty forward but that
                                obviously it would be more difficult under the circumstances.</item>

                            <item>The Chargé emphasized the need for prompt reaction from our allies
                                in order that we might make judicious and carefully thought out
                                responses to the recent Soviet moves. Holst said that he understood,
                                but he felt that Norway might not have a great deal to offer in
                                terms of specifics. Nevertheless, he promised to get back to us with
                                any reactions his government might have as quickly as possible.<note

                                    reported that on January 4 Holst gave the Embassy a statement on
                                    Norway’s position regarding the Soviet military intervention in
                                    Afghanistan. The statement read, in part: “We would consider it
                                    particularly important that the responses be focused as directly
                                    as possible on the context of power relations in the area most
                                    immediately affected by the invasion of Afghanistan. Hence we
                                    could emphasize the role of regional powers of the Indian
                                    subcontinent, the Gulf region and Asia. The political costs
                                    will, in our view, be maximized if the countries of the Third
                                    World play a front line role in the matter.” The statement
                                    further read: “In these circumstances Norway attaches the utmost
                                    importance to the maintenance of Western solidarity and
                                    security. At the same time, we have to examine carefully how the
                                    continued pursuit of arms control may enhance (and promote)
                                    overall security and stability.” (National Archives, RG 59,

                            <item>On departure the Chargé commended the strong position taken by
                                Prime Minister Nordli in his New Year’s Day television message to

                                pre-recorded his speech but felt that developments in Afghanistan
                                warranted comment. Therefore he had arisen at 6:30 in the morning
                                New Year’s Day to come in to the studio and tape a new portion on
                                Afghanistan.</item>

                            <item>Comment: Holst, who is generally recognized as one of the more
                                bold, articulate and incisive thinkers in the GON, struck us as
                                unusually cautious in his discussion of Afghanistan development.
                                Clearly he was concerned about the serious implications of the
                                situation for the Nordic area generally and Norway specifically. At
                                the same time, the GON has, in recent years, found that any
                                confrontation with the Soviet Union could be extremely demanding.
                                This background, coupled with the heavy stake the Labor government
                                has placed on detente/disarmament measures, may explain Holst’s
                                uncharacteristically cautious approach to Afghan developments. It
                                was our clear impression that Holst hoped that the Afghanistan
                                situation could be confined to that geographic area. While we expect
                                the Norwegians to follow any Alliance consensus, they would prefer
                                to see the Afghan crisis addressed with the least possible amount of
                                East-West confrontation in Europe.<note n="7" xml:id="d277fn7"
                                    >Telegram 3502 from Oslo, May 26, reported: “The Norwegians
                                    entertain few illusions as to either the expansive nature or
                                    exploitative purpose of Soviet policy.” It further noted: “At
                                    the same time, the prospect of protracted military confrontation
                                    with the Soviets in Europe is difficult for the exposed
                                    Norwegians to accept as a permanent condition of their national
                                    existence,” and “as elsewhere, the government must assess
                                    carefully the degree of public domestic support it can expect
                                    for any particular action. In view of the government’s tenuous
                                    political hold (it needs the support of a small, truculent, left
                                    party to rule) it must move cautiously.” (National Archives, RG

                            <item>Summary: I met with President Kekkonen on January 22 to share with
                                him our views on Afghanistan and its meaning for U.S. policy posture
                                and objectives and to engage him in a discussion on the meaning of
                                events for Finland. The President said that the actions of the
                                Soviet Union in Afghanistan were so unusual that it was not possible
                                to find any one clear motive for them. Increasing the tensions in
                                Northern Europe should be avoided by all means and an effort should
                                be made to calm the general atmosphere. Finland will continue along
                                its official foreign policy line, which it believes has succeeded
                                well, and as a country in a remote part of the world, will try to
                                keep its position strong in the face of influences from events
                                elsewhere. End summary.</item>

                            <item>Background: One of Finland’s most respected foreign affairs
                                analysts and commentators said in a private conversation on January
                                12 that these are “difficult and dangerous times for Finland.” The
                                challenge to Finland’s position and foreign policy posed by the
                                Soviet aggression in Afghanistan is clear. Finns are uncertain, but
                                there is no firm leadership. President Kekkonen is “old and
                                isolated”, “the politicians are young and ambitious”, and the public
                                comment on events is not helpful. Two days later, a senior MFA
                                official, describing the Finns as alarmed by the situation and
                                unhappy with the government’s response or lack of response to it,
                                said it was difficult to find any “logic” in what the Soviets had
                                done in Afghanistan. Successive governments there had undertaken to
                                assure the Soviet Union of their desire to have a peaceful
                                relationship. Afghanistan was, in his words, “in the bag as far as
                                the Soviet Union was concerned.” Yet it had been invaded. As the
                                whole of Finnish policy assumed the Soviets would be “logical” with
                                respect to Finland . . . it was difficult to know how Finland should
                                respond.</item>

                            <item>President Kekkonen did not share the apprehensions. I called on
                                him at Tamminiemi, the Presidential Residence rather than at the
                                palace. Also present, unexpectedly, were Keijo Korhonen, MFA Under
                                Secretary, acting as interpreter, and Pertti Torstila, MFA American
                                Desk officer, as notetaker. The President looked in good health,
                                somewhat thinner and far shorter than the advertised 6′4″. We spoke
                                for forty minutes, after which he went out for his afternoon ski
                                tour.</item>

                                departure, I told the President I was not calling pursuant to
                                instructions but rather as a result of my own desire, based on a
                                review of the Finnish media treatment of the U.S. response to the
                                Soviet aggression in Afghanistan, to present the U.S. view to him. I
                                wanted in particular to refer to two topics I knew were of interest
                                and importance to Finland, that is, arms control and CSCE.</item>

                            <item>President Kekkonen said that the actions of the Soviet Union in
                                Afghanistan were so unusual that it was not easy to find one clear
                                motive for them. What has happened either has been considered as a
                                local conflict or viewed as strategic in nature, part of a broader
                                plan. Afghanistan and Pakistan are “inflammable” areas.
                                Understanding the motivation will take some time and policies should
                                not be made too quickly. I shared with the President the range of
                                views as to motivation which were being offered by American analysts
                                and said we ourselves would not at this time say what single motive,
                                if any one could be identified, had led to the invasion. However,
                                the fact of the aggression required a response.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The President noted that “certain concerns” had been aroused also
                                in remote Northern Europe. Increasing tension in this area should be
                                avoided by all means and an effort should be found to calm the
                                general atmosphere. He had not observed anything special or alarming
                                in this regard in Finland. He was amazed at the small amount of
                                criticism in the (Finnish) press about Finland’s policy, but
                                tensions and pressures seem to have appeared in Norway and Denmark.
                                It was his hope that the balance could be preserved and that a
                                stable situation in the Nordic area would have a quieting effect on
                                other parts of Europe.</item>

                            <item>I told the President that even as the United States was taking
                                steps to make clear to the Soviet Union that its invasion of
                                Afghanistan was not cost free, and that such action could never be,
                                we had not lost sight of our determination to proceed with the arms
                                control agenda, with some exceptions, or our commitment to CSCE as
                                an essential process in the development of European security and
                                cooperation. One could not say at what pace we could proceed, but we
                                had not abandoned, as some have suggested, our long-term objectives,
                                objectives which I was convinced also were shared by Finland.</item>

                            <item>President Kekkonen observed that detente is a process of long
                                duration. It will require a long construction phase before its
                                objectives are achieved but they offer the only lasting foundation
                                for peace, and for the future.</item>

                            <item>Turning to another subject, I asked the President for his view on
                                how it was possible for the Soviet Union to have thought, as
                                apparently it had, that it could proceed in Afghanistan without
                                damage to its other interests, including its interest in the
                                benefits of cooperation, and its interests in the non-aligned
                                movement. He answered that some of the decisions (of the United
                                States) surely must have come as a great surprise to some of the
                                leaders of the Soviet Union as well as its people. The Soviet Union
                                is known to have great economic difficulties. Targets in agriculture
                                and, particularly, industrial production have not been
                                achieved.</item>

                            <item>Just before our meeting, Kekkonen said, he had heard that Deputy
                                Prime Minister Kirillin had been relieved of his duties in Moscow.
                                He found that news, arriving in these times, surprising. It raises
                                questions. Both Brezhnev and Kosygin are old and now that Kirillin
                                has been pushed aside, a situation could arise in which there begins
                                to be a scarcity of experienced men in the leadership.</item>

                            <item>In approaching the end of the conversation, I asked the President
                                if he would comment on the significance to Finland of world events
                                as they were now unfolding.</item>
                            <label>14.</label>
                            <item>He replied that, as he had said at the outset, Finland had not
                                seen anything which would change its policy position, nor did he
                                consider great change possible. Finland will continue its official
                                foreign policy line which it believes has succeeded well. As a
                                country in a remote part of the world it will try to keep its
                                position strong in the face of influences from events elsewhere.
                                Finland does not try to proselytize with its foreign policy, but
                                offers its experiences and the results of that policy—“what we have
                                been able to achieve amidst our difficulties”—for inspection to
                                all.</item>

                                tell the President that I was confident the cooperation and dialogue
                                between the United States and Finland would continue. Leaving

                                that there may well be occasions when we hold different views of
                                what is required to reach objectives we share, for example in the
                                area of arms control.<note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4">On January 22,
                                    Kekkonen responded to January 20 call for a boycott of the

                                    Finland, the question of participation in the Olympic Games has
                                    been discussed as a matter of principle by the Finnish National
                                    Olympic Committee in 1978. It was decided then to support the
                                    view that all countries represented in the International Olympic
                                    Committee should abstain from boycotts or other politically
                                    motivated actions with regard to the Olympic Games. In
                                    accordance with this position, the Finnish National Olympic
                                    Committee continues to support the holding of the 1980 Summer
                                    Olympic Games in Moscow as planned.” (Telegram 15459 to All

                                positive nature of our relationship. For my part, I looked forward
                                to continuing my interest in Finland and was sure I would see many

                                has repeated Swedish concern over failure of Soviets to leave
                                Afghanistan.</item>

                            <item>(A) Swedish attitude towards U.S. policies in response was more
                                complicated. There was full understanding of grain sale suspension
                                and high technology transfer prohibition, but less understanding of
                                US call for Olympic boycott. Swedish participation in boycott
                                actions against Soviets has not been forthcoming since such
                                measures, in Swedish view and tradition, must be based on Security
                                Council-approved sanctions. On Olympics, leaders of non-aligned
                                Sweden have expressed view that, in the absence of UN sanctions,
                                decisions of participation at Moscow Games must be left to National
                                Olympic Committees. While Swedish Committee has yet to accept Soviet
                                invitation, it most probably will by May 24 deadline unless
                                substantial Western European opposition develops. Coupled with GOS
                                understanding of US responses were expressions of concern by Swedish
                                leaders that gains achieved through detente not be lost in aftermath
                                of Soviet invasion. The Swedes hoped particularly that disarmament
                                discussions (SALT II, CTB) would continue and that Madrid CSCE
                                meeting would take place on schedule.<lb/>(B) GOS attitude towards

                                        not feel sufficiently involved, qualified or experienced in

                                        Olympic Committee from deciding to send a team to Moscow.
                                        Their attitude has been based on the premises that the IOC
                                        is independent of the govt, including financially, and that
                                        govt intervention would simply introduce the issue of its
                                        right to do so and cause the IOC to dig in its heels. As of
                                        now, the IOC has not made a final decision but has announced

                            <item>Denmark consciously and consistently links its foreign and
                                security policy to the United States, but seeks to maintain a
                                cautious distance from the American lead. Denmark’s caution derives
                                in part from such “constant” factors as geographic exposure and
                                anti-militarism stemming from Denmark’s history of military defeats.
                                Obviously, these factors can hardly be addressed by U.S. policy. Of
                                greater consequence, therefore, are Denmark’s “current” fears that
                                contribute heavily to its caution: (1) fear that the U.S. may
                                overreact to Soviet adventurism; (2) fear that U.S. actions in
                                Middle East could draw Europe into confrontation with USSR at home;
                                (3) fear that U.S. will not show consistency and that violent
                                gyrations of U.S. policy such as on initial economic measures
                                against Iran (which we abruptly abandoned) could throw Europe
                                off-course and actually ahead of the U.S. on risky initiatives; (4)
                                fear that new U.S. toughness derives from electoral considerations
                                what could be reversed next year. All of these fears reflect basic
                                Danish pre-occupation with domestic solidarity and comfort and their
                                desire to avoid international tension, especially international
                                tension arising outside of Europe which might affect their own
                                immediate welfare.</item>

                                fearful that new U.S. policies could break the communications link
                                with the USSR. In essence, this means that the Danes believe it
                                possible that a restraining influence could be exercised on the
                                Russians through rational persuasion.</item>

                            <item>The perception of the Soviet threat is not uniform among shapers
                                of Danish policy. Those most aware are the military, including all
                                of those in the highest ranks. The Foreign Ministry has similar
                                perceptions. Ministers in the Danish Government, all Social
                                Democrats, have varying views, with few seeming to perceive the
                                immediacy of the threat. Other parties in the Parliament, in a
                                general sense, split between those on the right and those on the
                                left, and only the former support increased defense spending as a
                                response to the Soviet threat.</item>

                            <item>When one thinks in terms of geography, all Danes are aware of
                                Soviet and East European activities in the Baltic area. When they
                                think of a Soviet threat, their thoughts turn first to the Northern
                                European area. Few Danes think in terms of the indivisibility of the
                                Soviet threat. The great majority are probably little troubled by
                                events in Afghanistan, at least to the extent of seeing aggression
                                there as a direct threat to Denmark’s security.</item>

                            <item>The above thinking does condition Danish response in a negative
                                way; i.e., the remoteness of events in Afghanistan means that they
                                do not exert great pressure on the Danes to increase their defense
                                preparedness. Moreover, regardless of their view of the threat,
                                roughly half of all Danes probably feel that Denmark is impotent to
                                respond to it and, more concerned about their present economic
                                difficulties, prefer to concentrate on “at home” issues.</item>

                                welfare, was unwilling even to give an indication of preference
                                concerning the response of Danish athletes. The result is that

                            <item>Given the fact that Denmark has little economically or
                                diplomatically at stake in Afghanistan, Danes are likely to go along
                                with measures that other NATO allies are willing to adopt re
                                Afghanistan itself. As for measures affecting the Soviet Union
                                directly, the Danes will be more reticent with the word “detente”
                                used as a code for a go-slow policy.</item>

                                grown more reticent in planning details, and wondered if the trip
                                would materialize. He thought the timing, given Poland, might be

                            <item>Frydenlund said he hoped the Soviets realized that the reaction in
                                Europe after an intervention in Poland would be much different than
                                following Afghanistan. The Secretary emphasized the importance of
                                the Soviets hearing this from Frydenlund.</item>

                            <item>Frydenlund said Norway was interested in a high level meeting with
                                the Soviets because of bilateral issues, such as the boundary
                                question. He expected Brezhnev to be very critical of Norway’s role
                                in NATO—especially Norway’s increasing military commitments, and
                                acceptance of stockpiling.</item>

                            <item>Secretary Muskie said Frydendlund should not let the Soviets put
                                him on the defensive. Instead the Norwegians obviously have no
                                aggressive intent; their taxpayers have no interest in spending
                                excess amount on weapons. NATO has reacted to Soviet actions. The
                                Secretary recalled that even before recent troop movements to the
                                Polish border, the Soviets had some 26 divisions in the GDR,
                                Czechoslovakia and Poland. Surely this is a threat rather than
                                prepositioned materiel to be used in the event Norway were attacked.
                                Therefore there was no need to be defensive about Western efforts in
                                the defense field, be it defense spending in general or
                                modernization programs like TNF. In this regard the Secretary noted
                                the Soviets had already deployed 200 SS–20s against Europe and
                                planned to deploy 100 more. Therefore the Western TNF decision was a
                                reaction, not an aggressive threat against the Soviets.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary said whenever he meets with Gromyko or Dobrynin he
                                stresses that the American people and government do not want
                                confrontation, but prefer normal relations with the Soviet Union.
                                This, however, requires a serious effort by the latter to offer
                                material assurances, such as removing Soviet troops from
                                Afghanistan, and by living up to the principles contained in the
                                Helsinki Final Act. In such a case they would find the American
                                people ready to improve relations with the Soviet Union in all
                                fields, including enhanced trade and the movement of people and
                                ideas.</item>

                            <item>Frydenlund asked if recent trends in the United States indicated
                                that these long term goals of increased contact and
                                non-confrontational, evolutionary change were being abandoned. Were
                                events in Poland already leading to a decisive change against
                                detente even though the positive changes which occurred in the labor
                                movement in Poland, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, could not have
                                occurred without the detente process of the past decade?</item>

                            <item>The Secretary agreed that the progress we have seen in Eastern
                                Europe was a benefit of the CSCE process, and that in this period
                                the United States had been able to improve markedly its relations
                                with governments in Eastern Europe. Nonetheless a brutal suppression
                                of Poland would not be just a temporary side effect of progress
                                brought about by CSCE. Mr. Bartholomew then added that it would be
                                doubtful that anyone could argue after an intervention that a
                                benefit of this thing called detente was that it enlarged the
                                freedom of action of Eastern European governments.</item>

                            <item>Frydenlund agreed that such an action would be the end of detente
                                and that he would say so in Moscow. The Secretary noted the Soviets
                                appeared unwilling to listen or even to discuss the merits of the
                                Polish situation. He hoped a strong, unified signal from the
                                Ministers would help. In response to Bartholmew’s statement that an
                                intervention would signal Soviet disregard for detente,<note n="3"

                                intervene such restraint—in the face of Polish politico-social
                                experiments—would need to be seen as proof of the benefits of
                                detente. Therefore the next several weeks would be fateful.</item>

                            <item>State Secretary Holst noted that one of the key problems was that
                                the Soviets had been unable to develop anything but inorganic power
                                links with Eastern Europe. Secretary Muskie added that they resisted
                                change in all aspects of society. Frydenlund said one hopeful
                                exception could be seen in Hungary, but that developments in Poland
                                could be too much too fast.</item>

                            <item>SALT: Frydenlund then asked the Secretary if he thought SALT would
                                go down the drain. Muskie responded that both sides have vital
                                national interests in preserving the SALT process. Nonetheless, the
                                ratification of SALT II required broad support in the Senate which
                                was made impossible by the invasion of Afghanistan. If the Soviets
                                suppressed Poland the Secretary did not see how SALT could make
                                progress and he felt the Soviets understood this.</item>

                            <item>Frydenlund noted that the Soviets will be facing great internal
                                and external problems in coming years, and that unfortunately they
                                may well choose to rely on the only area where they have had
                                success—the massing of modern military power. Holst noted that this
                                was the one Soviet economic sector where growth was possible without
                                social or systemic change.</item>

                            <item>Afghanistan: In response to a question from Frydenlund, the
                                Secretary explained the stalemated situation in Afghanistan despite
                                the continuing efforts of 85,000 Soviet troops. He noted that the
                                disjointed resistance movement manages to fight on with minimal
                                outside assistance. Muskie also noted that there are now over one
                                million refugees in Pakistan who need food aid. The Secretary
                                concluded that the Soviets seem committed to sticking it out and are
                                building permanent infrastructure for their military. Bartholomew
                                noted that whatever their problems they do have the geo-strategical
                                benefit of occupying Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. The
                                Secretary noted that the Soviets must also know that the resistance
                                is not getting substantial help from outside, and that Pakistan is
                                growing discouraged. He noted that the erosion of European interest
                                and sanctions has an effect on prospects in Afghanistan. The
                                Secretary concluded that the Soviets would probably stay unless they
                                found a real face-saving solution. In the meantime they can afford
                                to wait and they can even launch peace-feelers like their recent one
                                re the Persian Gulf, which the Secretary characterized as a “fox in
                                the chicken coop” effort.</item>

                                Holmes recalled that the Soviets often launch purposefully
                                distracting political ideas during such aggressive periods, and he
                                asked if Frydenlund expected them to push the Nordic nuclear weapon

                                did not think they would push it, especially since it was a Finnish
                                proposal, though they might vaguely support it. Should they push he
                                said Norway could always refer to its national position that any
                                limits on nuclear weapons would logically need to include those
                                already in place in the areas—i.e. on the Kola Peninsula—which
                                should discourage the Soviets. He concluded that he would not raise
                                the NNW free zone idea in any event.</item>

                                should not have been sensitive but that when added to the 3 percent,
                                TNF, and the Olympic boycott it crested in a heated defense debate,
                                similar to those previously encountered in Belgium, Holland, and
                                Denmark. While the prepositioning issue would probably pass
                                successfully, Frydenlund was afraid that nuclear sensitivities would
