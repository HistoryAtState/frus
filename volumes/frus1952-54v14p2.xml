                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean</persName>: We have been giving some
                            thought to the negotiation of the Administrative Agreement and I am
                            writing this letter to acquaint you with our views about certain
                            political and procedural aspects which we consider important.</p>
                        <p>We have been told informally by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Katsuo Okazaki</persName>, who until
                            recently served as Chief Cabinet Secretary and is now in the Cabinet
                            without portfolio but informally designated as Foreign Minister, will
                            act as principal negotiator of the Agreement for Japan, assisted by Vice
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>,<note n="1" xml:id="d463fn1">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Kumao Nishimura</persName>, Chief of
                                the Treaty Bureau in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</note> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_IY1">Yujiro Izeki</persName>, head of the
                            International Cooperation Bureau. <persName corresp="#p_IY1">Izeki</persName> is a career Foreign Office man who spent over a
                            year with the National Police Reserve, and his Bureau is expected to be
                            responsible for maintaining liaison with the United States security
                            forces in the future. Officials from other Ministries, particularly
                            Finance, will of course figure prominently, at least in an advisory
                            capacity. In this regard, there is much talk in the press about
                            formation of a new Defense Ministry but this development is not expected
                            to come until after the effective date of the Peace Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Office sources state that on matters of substance the Japanese
                            feel they have done just about all they can in advance of the talks by
                            submitting to you their comments on jurisdiction<note n="2" xml:id="d463fn2">For summaries of some of the Japanese submissions,

                            by our forces, and on most issues, including relevant items of the
                            budget, they appear to be biding their time. The Japanese do not appear
                            to contemplate a full-dress conference but they will be ready if the
                            negotiators decide on some form of conference procedure.</p>
                        <p>We feel the important point in this connection is that the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> Government will be under very
                            powerful political pressure in negotiating the Administrative Agreement.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> has lost considerable
                            political strength in the last few months largely because of failures in
                            domestic policies. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>’s
                            criticisms of the Government, <pb xml:id="pg_1066" n="1066" facs="0010"/>especially over rice decontrol, together with emasculation of the
                            administrative reorganization program and a general public impression
                            that the present Cabinet has no fixed policies and no reliable
                            leadership, have combined to reduce <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s popularity from its high point at the time of
                            the San Francisco Conference to the stage where dissolution of the Diet
                            in the next few months, though perhaps not probable, is at least a
                            possibility, even though the normal four-year term for members of the
                            House of Representatives will not expire until January 1953. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s main source of strength has
                            been his success in getting a peace treaty, as well as the popular
                            belief that his diplomatic experience would enable him to deal
                            effectively with the United States and the Allied Powers in matters
                            relating to the peace settlement. Should the Japanese Diet and public
                            feel that the Administrative Agreement does not represent a good bargain
                            for Japan, <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and the Liberal
                            Party as now constituted might well lose much of their remaining
                            support, as a consequence of which the present rather delicate political
                            balance might be expected to collapse. Regardless of what we may think
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> Cabinet and its
                            policies, it is necessary to recognize that in the present political
                            circumstances there appears to be no desirable alternative. The
                            opposition parties are disorganized and politically ineffective if not
                            incompetent, and if the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            Government is compelled to give way we may have to deal with a weak
                            coalition cabinet which may contain elements hostile to the proposed
                            security arrangements. In order to satisfy the public that Japan is
                            getting the best possible deal, the Japanese negotiators will probably
                            go over every proposal with the utmost care, and delay in reaching
                            agreement will almost inevitably result.</p>
                        <p>Our experience at the recently concluded Fisheries Conference<note n="3" xml:id="d463fn3">The Tripartite Fisheries Conference of Canada,
                                Japan, and the United States took place in Tokyo Nov. 5–Dec. 14,
                                1951. For additional information, see the editorial note, <ref target="frus1951v06p1">

                            took twice as long to reach as had been anticipated by our side, and
                            although I think the original estimate of three weeks was unduly
                            optimistic, we were painfully reminded that it is easy to over-estimate
                            Japanese willingness to oblige. The Fisheries Conference fairly readily
                            achieved agreement on basic principles but to obtain full agreement on
                            all matters of principle and on wording required far more time. We
                            gained considerable respect for the bargaining skill of the Japanese,
                            who never missed a point and had infinite patience in exploring issues
                            and in rephrasing ideas until something acceptable came out. They were
                            also well prepared on the facts involved and at times succeeded in
                            making some of our arguments look rather weak.</p>

                        <p>We feel some concern that if the negotiations on the Administrative
                            Agreement are difficult and protracted, the timetable for Treaty
                            ratification may be affected. I believe Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Senators Sparkman and <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> left Japan assured that we were
                            on the right course and that the Peace and Security Treaties<note n="4" xml:id="d463fn4">For the Peace Treaty, signed at San Francisco Sept.

                            inadequate evidence available out here, it would seem quite possible
                            that the Pentagon might desire a postponement of ratification until the
                            Administrative Agreement is successfully concluded, in which event delay
                            in negotiating the Administrative Agreement could conceivably have an
                            adverse effect on the attitude of the Senate. Likewise an unfavorable
                            impression might be created if the Senate should consent to approval of
                            the Treaties but formal ratification by the United States were delayed
                            unduly pending conclusion of the Administrative Agreement. You are of
                            course in a much better position to judge this matter, but we do want to
                            emphasize that negotiation of the Administrative Agreement may well take
                            considerable time and require great patience on the part of all
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>A final aspect of the negotiations that could be a real headache is the
                            white heat of publicity which will undoubtedly focus on everything
                            connected with the talks. We found at the Fisheries Conference, which
                            was held at the Foreign Office, that the Japanese press was able to
                            obtain within a day all Conference documents, even those classified
                            “confidential” for working purposes, and also to get accurate summaries
                            of discussions at the Conference. To read about delicate negotiations in
                            the press produced some irritation on our side and showed clearly that
                            at the present time enforcement of security measures on the Japanese
                            side is apt to be very ineffectual. We anticipate that the press will
                            devote major efforts to developing information about the Administrative
                            Agreement, and political and public pressure to get information on the
                            progress of the discussions will be very powerful. Floods of petitions
                            about property and rearmament and demonstrations of opposition to the
                            Agreement, which many of the Japanese seem to consider synonymous with
                            remilitarization, are also not at all unlikely.</p>
                        <p>In this connection we have noted what amounts virtually to a campaign on
                            the part of certain American correspondents and businessmen in Tokyo to
                            encourage the Japanese to take a firm position in negotiating the
                            Agreement, particularly in opposition to retention <pb xml:id="pg_1068" n="1068" facs="0012"/>by the United States of facilities and troops
                            in Tokyo. There is nothing underhanded or unpatriotic about these
                            efforts but I think it is a factor you may wish to consider in your
                            relations with the press here.</p>
                        <p>Although I have not discussed the matter with General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>, I feel it may be desirable
                            that the major part of the discussions be held in <gloss target="#t_PolAd1">PolAd</gloss>’s new office building, the
                            Mitsubishi Shoji, where we will have a large conference room and office
                            space for you and your staff. In this way I think we can obtain greater
                            security of information and also at least partially avoid giving the
                            Japanese the impression that the talks are being held under the aegis of
                            the Army.</p>
                        <p>I do not propose to go into matters of substance in this letter, but I
                            would like to observe that emphasis on joint committees, the approach we
                            discussed with General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>

                            working out the details of the Agreement as well as implementing the
                            Agreement after its conclusion, seems politically very desirable and
                            will give the Japanese the feeling of equality which critics of the
                            Security Treaty claim has been lacking in negotiations to date. The
                            Japanese may want to draft the Administrative Agreement in such a way
                            that the provisions relating to the Joint Committee will be placed in a
                            prominent position, just as they proposed revision of the United States

                        <p>On January 5, 1952, officials of the United States and the United
                            Kingdom, led by the President and the Prime Minister, held a dinner

                            <item>“At this point, I said that I wished to raise a related matter
                                which had to do with bringing our policies vis-à-vis Japan’s
                                relation to Formosa in line. I pointed out the trouble which existed
                                in Tokyo, saying that the Japanese Government wished to make an
                                arrangement with the Nationalist Government relating to the
                                establishment of peaceful, political, and trade relations between
                                Nationalist-held areas and Japan, but that they did not propose to
                                recognize the Nationalist Government as the Government in control of
                                the mainland, or at this time to take any steps regarding Japan’s
                                relations with the mainland of China.</item>
                            <item>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWS1">Churchill</persName> said that he
                                had gone along with the Labor Government’s recognition of China,
                                since he was under the impression that we were withdrawing from
                                China and he saw no other practical course. However, he thought that
                                the Labor Government’s policy, as they had later pursued it was
                                wrong.</item>
                            <item>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> spoke rather
                                strongly against our view that the Japanese Government could or
                                should enter into relations with Formosa, because he believed that
                                this would prejudice any future relations with the mainland and
                                would inevitably give rise to the view in Japan that we were forcing
                                this attitude and would thereby have a bad reaction against us. He
                                also thought that this violated the agreement with Mr.
                                Morrison.</item>
                            <item>“I pointed out what the nature of the <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>-Morrison agreement was: that it related to
                                Japan’s long-run relations with the mainland, with which we were not
                                now dealing, and, in effect, said that these should be left for
                                action after the occupation had ended. I pointed out that at the
                                present time <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> had withdrawn all
                                control over most of Japan’s foreign affairs and that, with the
                                knowledge and approval of the British, the Japanese were now engaged
                                in making treaties with New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, and the
                                Philippines. All of these negotiations were for the purpose <pb xml:id="pg_1070" n="1070" facs="0014"/>of easing ratification of
                                the Japanese peace treaty by the Parliaments of those countries. I
                                saw no reason why the Japanese should not be free to enter into the
                                same sort of arrangements with the Nationalist Government which were
                                quite essential for the purpose of getting ratification by our
                                Senate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWS1">Churchill</persName> thought
                                that this was more of a point than Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> appeared to. However, the President and Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CWS1">Churchill</persName> instructed Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and me to work this
                                thing out and reach a satisfactory solution of it. This we said we
                                would do.”(Conference files, lot 59 D 95, CF 100)</item>

                            from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> with
                            reference to China. I indicated the nature of the letter as reported to

                        <p>I now have the original letter from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> dated December 24, 1951. I have
                            given a photostatic copy in confidence to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>. The letter conforms closely to
                            what was forecast by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>’s
                            telephone conversation.</p>
                        <p>I have also received from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> his 3–point memorandum of December 27, which
                            purports to be “a re-statement” of what he said in the course of
                            conversations in Tokyo, and which conversations, of course, preceded the
                            December 24 letter. Also <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>
                            has cabled that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> has stated
                            that I may “unqualifiedly rest assured there has been no change” in his
                            attitude and policy set forth in the December 24 letter.</p>

                            that after conference with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, he was informed that the Japanese Government

                            the formula had first been rejected by the British Cabinet on the ground
                            that inevitably Japan would follow U.S. policy toward China rather than
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> policy. Mr. Attlee had made the
                            counter proposal that Japan’s relations with China might be vested in a
                            group of Far Eastern countries so that Japan would not have freedom of
                            action as regards China. This proposal in turn had been rejected by Mr.

                                in regard to China which might prejudice Japanese best interests for
                                the future. Under these circumstances a good deal would depend upon
                                the degree of freedom which might, in fact, be restored to Japan

                        <p>5. On September 8, 1951, the Multilateral Peace Treaty was signed at San
                            Francisco. Developments at the preceding Conference already made it
                            apparent that Japan would be expected to exercise a large degree of
                            independent sovereignty with respect to its foreign relations after the
                            signature but before the coming into force of the Treaty. (See, for
                            example, the exchanges of views between the Japanese Delegation and the
                            Indonesian, Philippine and Netherlands Delegations, which contemplated
                            post-signing but pre-ratification negotiations for bilateral
                            arrangements.)</p>

                                the present Government of Japan was strongly anti-Communist and did
                                not want to favor or encourage the Communists either in Japan or on
                                the Asian mainland. . . . Against this the Japanese Government were

                                the Nationalist Government as would assure their good will in
                                various <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> organizations where that
                                government had a vote and a voice which the Japanese needed on their
                                behalf as applicants for membership in <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> agencies. Also we assumed the Japanese would want

                                empowered to speak for, and to bind, all of China. I recalled that I
                                had expressed this point of view in London.”</item>

                            to the Japanese Government authority to deal directly with foreign
                            governments whose diplomatic representatives were accredited to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. Those named included “the Chinese

                        <p>8. Pursuant to the multilateral Treaty of Peace and the <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> authority above mentioned, the
                            Japanese Government began actively to exercise sovereignty as regards
                            its prospective treaty relations with many of the foreign governments
                            which had diplomatic representatives accredited to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. Among others with which such
                            negotiations were initiated were the U.S. and Canada (fishing),
                            Indonesia (reparations and fishing), the Philippines (reparations),
                            India (general peace), Korea (bilateral treaty of friendship and
                            commerce) and Australia (fishing). All of these negotiations were
                            conducted by Japan in the exercise of a sovereign and independent
                            status, there being no exercise whatever by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> of its potential control of Japanese foreign
                            relations.</p>

                            along the lines which he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had discussed on December 13, and that he
                            expected to clarify the Japanese Government position and subsequently
                            communicate with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. He
                            strongly hoped that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> would
                            acquiesce in the proposed Japanese position as it was embarrassing to
                            the Japanese Government to be confronted with opposing U.S.–<gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> position.<note n="14" xml:id="d466fn14">No memorandum of this conversation has been found in Department of

                        <p>16. On January 8, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had a
                            New Year’s press conference in Tokyo in which he is reported to have

                            afternoon at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ request
                            for preliminary discussion on relations between Japan and China
                            preparatory to the meeting between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ADG1">Acheson</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> on January 10. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated he thought it would be helpful, in view of
                            the fact that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had come
                            into this problem “in the middle”, to make a chronological statement and
                            put the matter in proper focus. He gave <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir
                                Oliver</persName> a memorandum, copy attached,<note n="1" xml:id="d467fn1">Not found attached; apparently the same as the

                                </ref>.</note> setting forth the
                            history of the problem from <pb xml:id="pg_1076" n="1076" facs="0020"/>May 19, 1951, until the present date. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that in all his actions he had been
                            motivated by the desire to keep US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            policy as close together as possible and at the same time bring about an
                            early ratification of the Japanese peace treaty by the United States
                            Senate. He emphasized that he had resisted attempts by members of the
                            Senate to take the stand that Japan should at once conclude a peace
                            treaty with Nationalist China and was hopeful that the action he had
                            taken and which he would explain to <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir
                                Oliver</persName> would result in the Senate’s early ratification of
                            the treaty without attaching reservations concerning the necessity of
                            Japan’s concluding a treaty with Nationalist China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had consistently borne in mind
                            the agreement with the former Labor Government that Japan should have
                            free choice as to what was in its best interests, that nothing should be
                            done which would compel Japan to make a treaty with Nationalist China
                            which would recognize Nationalist China as at present able to speak for
                            all of mainland China, and that any treaty which might be negotiated
                            between Japan and Nationalist China should not be finally consummated
                            until after the coming into force of the multilateral treaty of peace.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reiterated previous
                            remarks that it would be most unfortunate for all of us, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> included, if at this juncture the United
                            States Senate should fail to ratify the treaty and thus prevent its
                            early coming into force. He then informed <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName> that he had just recently received by mail
                            from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> a letter stating
                            what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s position was
                            with regard to China and the action which his Government desired to
                            take. He showed this letter to <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir
                                Oliver</persName> in confidence with the request that he inform Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> about it and about Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ conviction that with
                            such a letter it would be possible to obtain Senate ratification. He
                            added that at no time had it been his understanding of the <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>-Morrison agreement<note n="2" xml:id="d467fn2">Reference is to the statement, “Chinese
                                Participation and Formosa”, June 19, 1951, <ref target="frus1951v06p1">

                            prevent Japan from taking action which it deemed in its own interest,
                            and he pointed out how the facts of US–Japan relationships were such
                            that it was unthinkable, for the next several years at least, that Japan
                            would pursue a policy in the Far East which was counter to that of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>After reading the letter <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir
                                Oliver</persName> stated that he had certain observations to make
                            which he hoped would be helpful in considering the coming talks between
                            the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> on
                            this matter. He stated that he had the distinct impression that the
                            attitude of the present British Government toward China was not entirely
                            the same as that of the Labor Government, but that, while it <pb xml:id="pg_1077" n="1077" facs="0021"/>did not consider the
                            importance of diplomatic relations with Communist China in the same
                            light as its predecessor, nevertheless it did agree with the Labor
                            Government that <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                            had no future on the mainland of China, and that, while possibly the
                            Chinese Communist Government might not last, nevertheless <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Chiang</persName>’s Government could not return.
                            It therefore would not be the belief of the present Government that
                            anything should be done which would add to the prestige or stability of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> Government,
                            which was looked upon by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and by
                            important elements of the Commonwealth, such as India, as a symbol of
                            what should not be.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName> then turned to the
                            question of how the discussions might go between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADG1">Acheson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and pointed out that, while Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> certainly had a
                            knowledge of American Constitutional processes, nevertheless he probably
                            did not have as deep an understanding of their actual workings as
                            someone who had spent more time in the United States; therefore, in
                                <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName>’s opinion, it
                            would be more persuasive if the American Constitutional aspect of this
                            problem, i.e. the obtaining of Senate ratification, not be emphasized at
                            the beginning of the talks. He suggested rather that the facts of the
                            Japan-China situation be enumerated; namely, the long-term pull toward
                            the continent, the necessity of action which would ensure that this pull
                            did not operate to the detriment of the West and that Japan remain part
                            of the Western camp rather than that of Soviet Communism, and the
                            necessity of Japan’s aligning its policies with those of the United
                            States at this time when the United States had in fact great
                            responsibilities regarding the defense of Japan and its economic future.
                            After these points had been properly developed it would then be possible
                            to mention the problem connected with ratification of the treaty in the
                            United States Senate.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName> said that in his

                            requested to state his understanding of the situation. He spent some
                            time going over the complete history of the problem of Japan’s relations
                            with China, beginning with the statement Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had made on May 19, 1951, that
                            the Japanese Government under no circumstances desired signature by the
                            Chinese Communist regime to the peace treaty with Japan and that
                            basically the Japanese Government wishes to make peace with the Chinese
                            Nationalist Government on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that in all
                            his actions he had been motivated by the desire to keep US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policy as close together as possible and
                            at the same time bring about an early ratification of the Japanese peace
                            treaty by the United States Senate.<note n="2" xml:id="d468fn2">

                            </note> He emphasized that
                            he had resisted attempts by members of the Senate to take the stand that
                            Japan should at once conclude a peace treaty with Nationalist China and
                            was hopeful that the action he had taken and which he would explain
                            would result in the Senate’s early ratification of the treaty without
                            attaching reservations concerning the necessity of Japan’s concluding a
                            treaty with Nationalist China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had consistently borne in mind the agreement with
                            the former Labor Government that Japan should have free choice as to
                            what was in its best interests, that nothing should be done which would
                            compel Japan to make a treaty with Nationalist China which would
                            recognize Nationalist China as at present able to speak for all of
                            mainland China, and that any treaty which <pb xml:id="pg_1079" n="1079" facs="0023"/>might be negotiated between Japan and Nationalist China
                            should not be finally consummated until after the coming into force of
                            the multilateral treaty of peace. He added that at no time had it been
                            his understanding of the <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>-Morrison agreement that it would prevent Japan from
                            taking action which it deemed in its own interest, and he pointed out
                            how the facts of United States–Japan relationships were such that it was
                            unthinkable, for the next several years at least, that Japan would
                            pursue a policy in the Far East which was counter to that of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> referred to the fact
                            that he had now received a direct communication from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, stating the intentions of the
                            Japanese Government, and that it would probably be necessary to make
                            this known during the course of the Senate’s consideration of the peace
                            treaty with Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            concluded by stating that in his opinion the action which the United
                            States had taken was the absolute minimum necessary to achieve the
                            desired results in the United States Senate and at the same time retain
                            the spirit and in fact the letter of the <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>-Morrison agreement. He expressed the hope that
                            the United Kingdom would be able to go along with this contemplated
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> expressed appreciation
                            for the detailed account given by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and said that he fully appreciated the factors
                            which influenced United States wishes in this matter. He could only
                            repeat what he had said before, namely that his Government would have
                            much preferred that any expression of intention by the Japanese with
                            respect to their future action could have been withheld until after the
                            actual coming into force of the treaty of peace, but that if, for what
                            seemed to the United States good and sufficient reason, this was not
                            possible, he did not believe that his Government would wish to make any
                            great issue over the matter. He reiterated the well known <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> view that nothing should be done which
                            would give the Japanese opportunity in the future to say that whatever
                            action they might take toward China was forced upon them and not the
                            result of their own free will. In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that final action by
                            Japan, including ratification of any treaty or agreement with
                            Nationalist China by the Japanese Diet, would not take place until after
                            the multilateral peace treaty had become operative, and hence would be
                            the free and voluntary act of the Japanese people.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ADG1">Acheson</persName> said that he
                            wished to supplement Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            remarks by pointing out that the Japanese would have great difficulty in
                            working out with the Government on Formosa the type of limited agreement
                            contemplated, and that the Chinese Nationalists had certain strong cards
                            in their hands. They might well induce certain of their friends in the
                            Senate to advocate a postponement <pb xml:id="pg_1080" n="1080" facs="0024"/>of ratification proceedings until the Senate could have
                            an opportunity to study in detail any proposed agreement between Japan
                            and Formosa to see whether or not it met all Chinese desires. This would
                            be bad enough, but there was a second course of action which might be
                            even more distressing, namely that the Senate would attach to the
                            ratification a reservation to the effect that the treaty would not
                            become operative until Japan had concluded an agreement with Formosa.
                            This not only would be bad for the United States, but would confront all
                            the other signatories to the treaty with a very difficult problem. The
                            Secretary then went on to say that it was most desirable to have Sir
                            Esler Dening, British Ambassador in Japan, informed of the results of
                            our talks so that if he were approached by the Japanese he could make
                            clear that if they desired to go ahead with beginning negotiations with
                            the Chinese Nationalist Government they would not incur the displeasure
                            of the British Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> thought this raised rather difficult problems and
                            might seem to necessitate his Government’s completely reversing its
                            previous stand and that this would be most embarrassing. Considerable
                            discussion then took place among those present over possible wording of
                            a message to Dening which would not do violence to the previous British
                            position and yet would indicate to the Japanese that if they took action
                            which they desired to do in their own interest the British Government
                            would interpose no objection. It was finally left that the British side
                            would endeavor to draft an appropriate instruction to Dening and would
                            consult later with the United States side on this matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d468fn3">

                                    substance states that as result of full exchange of views <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> understands US position, but
                                    nonetheless adheres to its prior stand. However, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> believes matter is one for Jap to

                                        <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will not put any pressure
                                    on Jap either to act or not to act in any particular manner.
                                    Dening was authorized to make above position known to Jap if
                                    questioned by them, but our understanding is that he is not to
                                    initiate discussions on this matter with Jap. ... In Dept’s
                                    opinion, Brit fully understand necessity of some public
                                    commitment by Jap re Chi, but are not for domestic polit reasons
                                    able to reverse their previous stand. . . . You shld seek an
                                    interview with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and
                                    inform him of results of talks with Brit on this matter. Brit
                                    agreed on fundamental necessity of Jap’s foreign policy’s being
                                    in harmony with that of US, and such differences as exist relate
                                    only to matter of timing of Jap announcement re policy. However,
                                    Brit also agree that in final analysis question of timing is one
                                    for Jap to decide. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> called by telephone
                            from Washington at 12:00 noon today. He said that he wished to advise me
                            concerning the present status of the talks between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and himself, on the one hand,
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, on the other. He
                            prefaced his remarks by saying that the British had not conceded quite
                            to the extent that we had hoped, but that some progress had been made.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> is sending a telegram to
                            Sir Esler Dening with instructions to the effect that if Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> should ask, but not
                            otherwise, Sir Esler is to say that the British still maintain their
                            earlier position, and would prefer that Japan make no decision on the
                            China question until after the restoration of complete sovereignty. On
                            the other hand, should the Japanese wish to make a decision now, no
                            objection will be raised by the British to such decision.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1083" n="1083" facs="0027"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> said that his
                            impression is that the British are now resigned to Japan’s probable
                            course of action. He also said that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s letter of December 24 had been
                            shown to <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver Franks</persName>, but
                            not to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, who, however, is
                            aware of the existence of the letter.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> said that
                            there will be no sudden reversal of British policy as previously
                            maintained, but that no further pressure would be placed by the British
                            upon the Japanese on the China question.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> the AFP
                            article alleging that Sir Esler Dening was encouraging the Japanese to
                            trade with Communist China in order to divert Japanese trade pressures
                            from Southeast Asia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>
                            said that this article is based on a column by Marquis Childs, who had
                            not talked with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> since
                            the latter’s return to Washington. He suspected, although he did not
                            definitely know, that Marquis Childs had obtained this information from
                            Senator H. Alexander Smith.</p>

                            made public but that we would be given ample warning and perhaps a
                            simultaneous release might be made. WJS<note n="1" xml:id="d470fn1">The

                            <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName> said that London felt
                            that it was “on the spot” because of the publication in Tokyo of
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s letter to me, which
                            took them somewhat by surprise. He said that he had told only <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> of the existence of the letter and
                            no one else. He recalled that the letter itself was not a matter of
                            discussion at the meeting of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ADG1">Acheson</persName> and myself, and that probably his Government
                            would merely take the formal line of saying that the letter had not been
                            discussed. He hoped that we would do nothing to give a contrary
                            impression.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName> that, while it
                            was true that the letter itself had not been discussed, the subject
                            matter of the letter had been discussed and that if I was put in a
                            position where I had to speak on the subject, I would have to say that
                            the letter had been shown in advance of the meeting to <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName> recognized that that
                            was the situation but said he hoped that we would not volunteer this
                            fact or mention it unless we were queried on it in a way which did not
                            permit of any avoidance. He said he would like “until the present storm
                            blew over” to be able to take the technical position that “The <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> letter had not been discussed
                            between <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ADG1">Acheson</persName>”.</p>
                        <p>I said that I did not myself foresee any occasion to make any statements
                            whatever at the present time.<note n="1" xml:id="d476fn1">

                                    memorandum of a telephone conversation held later on Jan. 16
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated:</p>

                                    back <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName> and was
                                    told that he had gone to the station to meet Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWS1">Churchill</persName>, so I spoke to Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_TFS1">Tomlinson</persName>, saying
                                    that I hoped whatever statement his Government made about the
                                        <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> letter would
                                    not be couched in such a way as to give rise to any indication
                                    of bad faith on our part as that might require a reply. While it
                                    was technically true that the text of the letter had not been
                                    discussed, the letter and its text were known in advance to
                                        <persName corresp="#p_FSOS1">Sir Oliver</persName> and Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, and the
                                    Japanese position, as set out in the letter, had been a major
                                    topic of discussion. It seemed to me, therefore, better that any
                                    statement they made should concede that the subject matter of
                                    the letter had been discussed although the text itself had not
                                    been mentioned.” (Memorandum attached to the source

                            dated December 10, 1951,<note n="1" xml:id="d477fn1">Not printed.</note>
                            submitted to the Political Adviser by Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs
                                <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName>, giving a summary of
                            the views of the Japanese Government for “sympathetic consideration by
                            the United States Government” in connection with any arrangement made
                            for administration of the Nansei and Nanpo Islands.</p>
                        <p>The enclosed memorandum makes reference to the keen public interest which
                            attended Diet discussions concerning Article III of the Treaty of Peace
                            and proposes the following measures as conducive to good relations
                            between the United States and Japan and to a mutually satisfactory
                            arrangement for the islands:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a summary of the enclosure.]</p>
                        <p>The enclosed memorandum is further evidence of the strong pressure in
                            Japan for action which will clarify the relation of the Nansei and Nanpo
                            Islands to Japan and clear the way for eventual restoration of the
                            islands to Japan.</p>
                        <p>There is little doubt that opposition to the separation of the Southern
                            Islands from Japan and to renunciation of rights to the Kurile Islands
                            and southern Sakhalin has constituted one of the strongest Japanese
                            reactions to the Peace Treaty. This attitude appears to vary from
                            disappointment, which is universally felt, to strong resentment, and
                            already serves as a rallying point for critics of the Treaty and of
                            United States policies towards Japan. Although the Soviet Union is also
                            a target of attack because of its occupation of the Kuriles and southern
                            Sakhalin, Japanese antipathy is perhaps less intense on this score
                            because ties with the Southern Islands were much closer and because
                            repatriation from the northern areas has left the loss of commercial
                            opportunity as the main bone of contention. The United States
                            sponsorship of the Peace Treaty has also made it possible for the finger
                            of recrimination to be pointed at the United States.</p>

                        <p>Japanese concern over the separation of the Nansei and Nanpo Islands has
                            given rise to powerful political pressure in support of efforts to
                            restore the islands to Japanese control or, as a minimum, to obtain
                            close relations between them and Japan. This position was expressed by
                            Diet members of all persuasions at the recent special session which
                            approved the Peace Treaty. The inhabitants of the islands have also
                            exerted pressure through local political agencies for close cooperation
                            with Japan. Popular advocacy of restoration in the form of mass
                            meetings, newspaper articles, petitions, and letters has been insistent.

                            their entire political energy towards reversion, and probably few
                            high-ranking officials in Japan—Japanese or American—have failed to
                            receive at least one long and plaintive petition from some organization
                            or individual connected with the Council for Reversion of Amami Oshima.
                            Available evidence indicates that sentiment for restoration is no less
                            strong even if not so vocal in the remainder of Nansei Islands.
                            Returnees from the Bonin Islands and Japanese businessmen desiring to
                            resume their activities have inspired a powerful movement for
                            restoration of the Bonin and other Nanpo Islands to Japan. There appears
                            to be little doubt that reunion of the Southern Islands with Japan is
                            strongly desired by the inhabitants of these islands and by the Japanese
                            people generally and that any steps taken in this direction by the
                            United States would be most gratefully received.</p>
                        <p>Statements by responsible United States leaders have apparently not
                            served to clarify the position of the United States or substantially to
                            allay Japanese concern. The term “residual sovereignty” as used at the
                            San Francisco Conference in describing the relation of Japan to the
                            Nansei and Nanpo Islands has no exact equivalent in Japanese and has
                            become the subject of much querulous quibbling. This term would appear
                            to be ambiguous in English to the extent that it could refer either to
                            legal title which would remain in Japan for the duration of United
                            States administration and would be entirely divorced from effective
                            control, or to an interest which would come into being at the conclusion
                            of United States administration, as a residual right in property.
                            Relying in part on Mr. Kenneth Younger’s statement on September 5 at the
                            San Francisco Conference that the Treaty does not remove the Ryukyus and
                            Bonins from Japanese sovereignty,<note n="2" xml:id="d477fn2">In the
                                course of his remarks before the Conference Younger, Minister of
                                State in the British Foreign Office, stated: “As regards the Ryukyu
                                and Bonin Islands, the treaty does not remove these from Japanese
                                sovereignty; it provides for a continuance of United States
                                administration over the Ryukyu Islands south of 29 north latitude;
                                that is to say that those islands nearest to Japan itself are to
                                remain not only under Japanese sovereignty, but under Japanese
                                administration as well.” For full text of Younger’s statement, see

                            not accept the view that this right of sovereignty can be a mere paper
                            interest devoid of any effective power. On December 14 Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> stated in
                            Tokyo his opinion and belief that a future administration of these
                            islands could be worked out in a friendly way which would combine the
                            natural desires of the inhabitants with the requirements of
                            international peace and security. This statement stirred up new hope in
                            Japan, particularly by its omission of any specific reference to a
                            possible United Nations Trusteeship, which the Japanese appear to
                            consider as one more possible but unnecessary barrier to resumption of
                            Japanese control of the islands.</p>
                        <p>Because of the political importance of this issue in Japan and because an
                            informal assurance has been given that practicable arrangements would be
                            worked out, it would appear desirable that action in the direction of
                            clarifying the position of the United States in this regard be taken in
                            the near future. In particular, it is believed important before the
                            Peace Treaty comes into force to clarify both the effect of residual
                            sovereignty and the nationality status of the inhabitants of the
                            islands, in order that the Japanese Government may take whatever legal
                            steps are required for putting Article III of the Treaty into
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>The Mission is of the opinion that close relations between Japan and the
                            Nansei and Nanpo Islands along the lines of the enclosed memorandum
                            should be encouraged and facilitated by the United States. Politically,
                            this objective is lent cogency by the intense feeling of the Japanese
                            and the islanders arising out of separation of the islands from Japan
                            and the consequent possibility of friction in United States relations
                            with Japan. Economically, the experience of six years of United States
                            administration would seem to indicate that so long as they are cut off
                            from Japan the Nansei Islands in particular are an expensive and
                            unrewarding proposition and that the economic capabilities of all these
                            islands will offer greater hope if they are developed in conjunction
                            with Japan. From the point of view of the strategic requirements of the
                            situation—the need to obtain secure bases for protection of United
                            States interests in the western Pacific—it is understood to be the
                            opinion of <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>, as transmitted to
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a recent staff study, that this protection
                            can be adequately obtained by arrangements similar <pb xml:id="pg_1092" n="1092" facs="0036"/>to those embodied in the Security Treaty with
                            Japan without involvement in any form of exclusive control by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The degree to which close relations between Japan and the Nansei and
                            Nanpo Islands should be fostered and the timing of any moves in this
                            direction would appear to be matters for determination at an appropriate
                            time in the future. The Mission believes, however, that as a matter of
                            policy the United States should impose only minimum restraints on
                            political, economic, and cultural relations between Japan and these
                            islands, and that the ultimate goal should be restoration of the Nansei
                            and Nanpo Islands to Japan. (The ultimate disposition of Marcus Island
                            and Parece Vela should perhaps be subject to additional consideration.)
                            As a beginning, it is believed that the legal status of the islands
                            should be clarified, if feasible by formal recognition of the
                            sovereignty of Japan and the Japanese nationality of the inhabitants;
                            the desirability of establishing Japanese Government representation in
                            the Nansei and Nanpo Islands should also be considered with a view to
                            assisting in the disposition of problems connected with Article III of
                            the Treaty of Peace and other matters having to do with relations
                            between Japan and these islands.</p>

                                by the phrase “prepared as soon as legally possible to conclude”?;
                                what was the significance of the Prime Minister’s having worded the

                                unilateral fashion?; and what did <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> mean by his undertaking to “promptly explore
                                this subject with the National Government”? (693.94/1–1752)</note>

                        <p>Para two. US has consistently taken position that while bilateral
                            treaties between Japan and other powers may be negotiated and even
                            proceed to point of initialing final draft of document, formal signature
                            of treaty cannot take place until multilateral treaty comes into effect.
                            This procedure has been and is being followed in present or recent
                            negotiation between Japan and US–Canada re fisheries, Indonesia and
                            Phils re reparations and fisheries, and India re treaty of peace. This
                            was explained to Amb <persName corresp="#p_KDVKW1">Koo</persName> by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on Jan 14.</p>
                        <p>Para three. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s wording of
                            sentence re scope of application bilateral treaty is in line with that
                            suggested to you on Sept 27, which was “Present treaty shall, in respect
                            of Republic of China, be applicable in all territories which are now,
                            and which may hereafter be, under control of Govt of Republic of China”.
                            Dept believes that unilateral form of this statement preferable in that
                            otherwise implication might be given that Japan would at some time in
                            the future once again take expansionist measures. It does not, in Depts
                            opinion in any manner imply placing either Govt in inferior
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Para four. Dept understand <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s undertaking “Promptly explore this subject with
                            Nationalist Govt” means Jap Govt will on its initiative shortly open
                            negotiations with Nationalist Govt either through head of Jap Govt
                            Overseas office Taipei or through dispatch of special envoy.</p>
                        <p>Dept trust above explanation will prove satisfactory to Chi Govt. In view
                            of flurry of dissatisfaction evidenced in Brit press over Jap action it
                            would be most helpful if Chi Govt can accept <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> letter in spirit written and express publicly no

                            <item>Arrangements for United States Forces in Japan in the Post-Peace
                                Treaty Period</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Article 6 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan permits the stationing or
                            retention of United States forces in Japan under a bilateral agreement
                            between the United States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>2. In Article I of the United States–Japan Security Treaty, Japan grants
                            and the United States accepts the right “to dispose United States land,
                            air and sea forces in and about Japan” upon the coming into force of the
                            Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>3. Article III of the Security Treaty provides that the “conditions which
                            shall govern the disposition of armed forces of the United States of
                            America in and about Japan shall be determined by administrative
                            agreements between the two Governments.”</p>
                        <p>4. There now remains the task of concluding with the Japanese Government
                            the necessary agreements on the conditions which shall govern the
                            disposition of United States forces in and about Japan in the post-Peace
                            Treaty period. This present memorandum deals with the Administrative
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>5. Decisions by the President are respectfully requested on the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">A. That the Administrative Agreement with Japan be
                                concluded as an Executive Agreement, after full consultation with
                                the appropriate Committees of Congress</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The Departments of State and Defense concur in recommending that the
                            President decide that the Administrative Agreement be negotiated and
                            concluded as an Executive Agreement, after full consultation with the
                            appropriate Committees of Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Administrative Agreement is in implementation of the Security Treaty
                            with Japan which will be submitted to the Senate; as an implementing
                            measure, it is an appropriate subject for an Executive Agreement. It is
                            in the nature of base agreement; post-war base agreements have generally
                            been handled as Executive Agreements. In the case of Japan, a high
                            degree of flexibility is desirable during the period of adjustment
                            following the end of the Occupation; an Executive Agreement provides
                            such flexibility. Preliminary <pb xml:id="pg_1096" n="1096" facs="0040"/>exchanges of views with the Japanese indicate that an Executive
                            Agreement would be the preferred method of handling from the Japanese
                            point of view, although the Japanese Government may wish to ask the Diet
                            for legislation on certain points, such as Jurisdiction. In order to
                            ensure adequate Congressional support, it is intended that the
                            Administrative Agreement be discussed, prior to negotiations with the
                            Japanese, with the Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committees of both
                            Houses of Congress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">B. That the draft Administrative Agreement be approved
                                as a basis for negotiation</hi>.</p>
                        <p>There is attached as Tab A the draft Administrative Agreement with Japan
                            which, with the exception of the Article on Criminal Jurisdiction, has
                            the concurrence of the State and defense Departments. The Articles on
                            Taxation and Expenses also have the concurrance of the Treasury
                            Department. It is requested that the draft, subject to such minor
                            modifications as may be considered desirable by the interested
                            Departments, be approved as the basis for negotiation with the Japanese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The attached draft agreement provides that facilities and areas to be
                            used by United States forces in Japan shall be determined by the two
                            Governments in consultation through a Joint Committee. United States
                            forces are authorized to continue to use facilities and areas now held
                            by them until arrangements agreed to through the Joint Committee can be
                            made effective. As in agreements covering the maintenance of United
                            States forces in other countries, the draft agreement with Japan confers
                            upon the United States such rights, power and authority as are necessary
                            or appropriate for the establishment, operation, defense and control of
                            the facilities and areas including transit privileges throughout Japan,
                            the establishment of navigation and communications systems, the use of
                            public services, and the right to establish post offices and post
                            exchanges.</p>
                        <p>The draft Agreement provides for the military arrangements which should
                            be taken in the event of hostilities, or in the event that hostilities
                            in the Japan area are threatened. The two provisions, known as “Defense
                            Measures”, in Article XXII,<note n="2" xml:id="d480fn2">Text of Article
                                XXII in the draft submitted to the President is the same as that in

                            States in carrying out its responsibilities under the U.S.-Japan
                            Security Treaty. The first provision confers on the Commander of United
                            States forces in the Japan area the authority and latitude to use these
                            United States forces to provide for the security of Japan and for the
                            maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East. He can
                            also take whatever actions are necessary to ensure the security of his
                                <pb xml:id="pg_1097" n="1097" facs="0041"/>forces in Japan. In
                            taking these actions he will not be limited by the terms of the
                            Administrative Agreement, nor can he be legally hampered by any
                            restrictions, delays, or lack of agreement on the part of the Japanese.
                            Under the terms of the second provision, in the event of hostilities, or
                            when either party believes hostilities are imminent in the Japan area,
                            the United States may establish a combined Command, to include Japanese
                            forces, and designate a Commander thereof, if the Japanese Government
                            agrees to such a Command.</p>
                        <p>As for sharing costs, the draft agreement provides that Japan will
                            furnish all real estate used by United States forces and, in addition,
                            an amount of Japanese currency to bring the Japanese contribution to
                            approximately one half of the local yen costs incident to maintenance of
                            United States forces in Japan (in the first year, this would be the
                            equivalent in yen of $155 million). The United States would bear the
                            other half of the yen costs and all of the dollar costs incident to pay
                            and allowances, rations, military equipment and transportation to and
                            from the United States. The two Governments undertake to re-examine the
                            determination of their relative contributions from time to time in the
                            light of the total resources which each is able to and does devote to
                            security and of any comparable arrangements for collective security
                            concluded by the United States with other powers.</p>
                        <p>As in agreements covering the maintenance of United States forces in
                            other countries, the draft agreement with Japan exempts the United
                            States Government and individual members of the armed forces and
                            civilians brought into Japan for purposes of the agreement, from
                            restrictions upon entry into Japan, import duties and general taxation.
                            In recognition of Congressional policy that funds made available by the
                            United States Government for military assistance to foreign countries
                            shall not be spent for the payment of taxes, the United States is also
                            exempted from taxation on the procurement of materials, supplies,
                            equipment and services in Japan. On the subject of civil jurisdiction
                            and the settlement of claims, the draft agreement adopts the basic
                            formulae of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of Forces
                            agreement; the formula on settlement of claims will require the
                            enactment of legislation, but it is believed that the legislaton
                            required for similar purposes in connection with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreements will suffice. The
                            Agreement would continue in force for the duration of the Security
                            Treaty.</p>

                        <p>There is a difference of view between the Departments of State and
                            Defense on criminal jurisdiction over members of United States forces,
                            the civilian component, and their dependents while <pb xml:id="pg_1098" n="1098" facs="0042"/>in Japan. The Department of State considers,
                            that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of Forces formula
                            should be used in Japan; the Department of Defense considers that
                            members of United States forces, the civilian component, and their
                            dependents should be immune from Japanese criminal jurisdiction except
                            where this immunity is waived by the United States forces.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State view is based upon the following factors:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) <hi rend="italic">General policy</hi>. Since the Declaration
                                of Independence U.S. public policy has been opposed to the immunity
                                of the military from the criminal jurisdiction of the civil
                                authority. This attitude is firmly held by other Governments; the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of Forces Agreement
                                and existing base agreements reflect the determination of
                                Governments generally to retain criminal jurisdiction over the
                                members of armed forces stationed in their respective
                                territories.</item>
                            <item>(b) <hi rend="italic">Japanese opinion</hi>. The Japanese have led
                                the historic resistance of the people of Asia against
                                extra-territoriality, discrimination and unequal treatment by the
                                West. Unless the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula is
                                used with respect to Japan, the Japanese will quickly identify a
                                gross discrimination and will assume that it means that we are
                                trying to treat them as (1) not sovereign, (2) a defeated enemy, or
                                (3) racially inferior. It will be difficult enough to maintain
                                friendly relations between our forces in Japan and the Japanese
                                people; it will be impossible if U.S. forces are looked upon as a
                                symbol of western discrimination and arrogance toward Asiatics.
                                Discrimination against the Japanese on the matter of jurisdiction
                                would provide opposition parties and groups in Japan an issue on
                                which to inflame national and racial feelings against a close
                                association with the United States. The voluntary membership of the
                                Japanese in the free world system is directly at stake on this
                                issue.</item>
                            <item>(c) <hi rend="italic">Asiatic opinion</hi>. The entire non-white
                                world will be watching closely the nature of our relations with
                                Japan to determine whether we are willing to work with a non-white
                                country on the basis of equality and partnership. Widespread
                                misgivings were expressed throughout Asia that the retention of U.S.
                                forces in Japan would be in derogation of Japanese sovereignty. The
                                political success of the Japanese Peace Treaty and the U.S.-Japan
                                Security Pact would be largely undermined if our post-Treaty
                                arrangements nullify the high ideals we expressed in connection with
                                the conclusion of these treaties. The one great issue which will be
                                decisive in setting the basis of our future relations with Asia will
                                be questions of equal treatment. Our discriminations at home are a
                                great burden upon our relations with Asia: an attempt to practice
                                similar discriminations officially in our relations with the
                                Governments of Asia would be considered by them to be
                                intolerable.</item>
                            <item>(d) <hi rend="italic">Practical factors</hi>. The issue here is
                                not that of impairing our official activities in Japan: persons
                                engaged in official duties are placed by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula under the primary
                                jurisdiction of U.S. authorities. The issue is whether U.S. military
                                personnel and the large numbers of accompanying civilians are to be
                                exempt from Japanese criminal jurisdiction while off duty. There are
                                no strange <pb xml:id="pg_1099" n="1099" facs="0043"/>“oriental”
                                crimes in the Japanese penal system: it was modernized by 1899 and
                                became the basis for the abolition of extra-territoriality at that
                                time: the Japanese Penal Code was further improved and modernized
                                under the Occupation.</item>
                            <item>(e) <hi rend="italic">Germany no precedent</hi>. The willingness
                                of the Germans to accept immunity of Allied forces from German
                                criminal jurisdiction is not a persuasive precedent, particularly in
                                face of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement. Germany
                                is not yet to be made soverign as is Japan and furthermore, in its
                                German context, there is no problem of racial discrimination.</item>

                        <p>The Department of Defense view is based upon the following
                            considerations:</p>

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff and General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> have emphatically stated that our forces in
                                Japan should be completely immune from Japanese criminal
                                jurisdiction as a matter of military necessity General Handy<note n="3" xml:id="d480fn3">Gen. Thomas T. Handy, USA, Commander in
                                    Chief, Europe.</note> has expressed equally strong views with
                                respect to the parallel situation of our troops in Germany. The
                                right to subject members of our forces to any substantial extent to
                                trial by Japanese courts for offenses against Japanese law and to
                                punishment by Japanese authorities in Japanese penal institutions or
                                by other authorized Japanese punishments could be so applied by
                                Japanese officials as materially to hamper <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> and the members of his
                                command in the execution of their security mission in Japan. First,
                                it would subject members of our forces, particularly personnel, to
                                harassment by unfriendly local officials in a manner which would
                                prevent them from performing their duties. It is not unlikely that
                                such officials, motivated by resentment against the presence of our
                                troops, or by resentment resulting from our war crimes trials of
                                Japanese individuals, or by hostility left over from the war, or by
                                a lack of sympathy with the mutual security objectives of the United
                                States and Japan, would, trump-up charges and carry on unjustified
                                and time-consuming prosecutions against United States personnel and
                                their commanders.</item>
                            <item>Another fundamental danger to our security mission would be the
                                adverse effect on the morale of our troops resulting from—1) the
                                possibility of harassment; 2) their being subject to strange laws
                                and strange procedures administered by a people who have different
                                standards and a different outlook from our own and who were not so
                                long ago our bitter enemies; 3) the fact that they would be subject
                                to this foreign system of justice involuntarily and not through
                                choice; 4) the loss of “face” which would result from the assumption
                                of jurisdiction over our troops by the Japanese; and 5) the fact
                                that the standards of treatment in Japanese penal institutions are
                                considerably different from ours. These considerations would also
                                have an adverse effect on home-front morale.</item>
                            <item>The military importance of having our troops immune from the
                                criminal jurisdiction of foreign countries (even in the case of our

                                such immunity. Its importance in “forward zones”, even in <pb xml:id="pg_1100" n="1100" facs="0044"/>time of “peace”, is shown
                                by the tripartite position taken in the present negotiations

                                contractual arrangements with Western Germany. This position calls
                                for complete immunity from German criminal jurisdiction, and
                                officials of the Bonn Government have indicated substantial
                                acceptance of the principle.</item>
                            <item>Japan is as much, and in many ways more of a “forward zone” than
                                in Western Germany. It is the view of the Defense Department that
                                the initial negotiating position of the United States vis-à-vis
                                Japan should be one which is consistent with, rather than one which
                                would undercut our negotiating position vis-à-vis the Federal
                                Republic of Germany.</item>
                            <item>One additional compelling reason for not applying the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of Forces formula to our
                                relationship with Japan is that our relationship with Japan involves
                                no reciprocal stationing of Japanese forces in the United States.
                                The normal <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> situation involves
                                an exchange of Personnel, so that possible unfair treatment of the

                                another <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> state is limited by
                                the fear of reprisals.</item>
                            <item>The Defense draft of Article XV governing criminal jurisdiction is
                                drafted in the light of the foregoing considerations. This position
                                should be presented to the Japanese as a transitional one. We should
                                indicate that after a period of adjustment to the new status it may
                                be re-examined. Meanwhile, we may test the practicability of the
                                exercise of Japanese criminal jurisdiction over our personnel by

                            disciplinary jurisdiction conferred on them by United States law.

                        <list>
                            <item>(a) Transmission is informal for his convenience and does not
                                preclude U.S. negotiators from proposing other language upon
                                arrival.</item>
                            <item>(b) We consider it of utmost importance that present text be held
                                on most confidential basis until negotiators can have initial talks
                                and consider public relations aspects with Jap reps and Gen
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>.</item>

                            <item>(c) Present text does not attempt to deal with specific facilities
                                and areas since these involve great mass of detail and will require
                                continuous consultation and review by appropriate US and Jap
                                authorities in Joint Committee. We believe this arrangement is in
                                mutual interest and is only practical way to proceed.</item>
                            <item>(d) Present text represents genuine effort take into full account
                                Jap views given us informally as well as basic relationship between
                                US and Jap as equal partners in great common effort of vital concern
                                to both. Great confidence which draft places in Jap involves
                                correspondingly heavy obligations upon Jap to play its part.</item>
                            <item>(e) Present draft reflects US views in light of complex legal,
                                political and economic relationships not only as between US and Jap
                                but involving many govs in similar relationships. Hence present text
                                should not be considered merely as an initial bargaining position;
                                it already reflects major concessions to Jap interests and views,
                                some of historical significance. Substantial changes would be
                                difficult to make without serious results in vast complex of free
                                world security arrangements and without greatly adding to burdens of
                                world-wide responsibilities which US is now required to carry.<note n="3" xml:id="d481fn3">

                            between the United States and Japan on all matters requiring mutual
                            consultation regarding the implementation of this Agreement. In
                            particular, the Joint Committee shall serve as the <pb xml:id="pg_1110" n="1110" facs="0054"/>means for consultation in determining the
                            facilities and areas in Japan which are required for the use of the

                            the United States and of Japan, each of whom shall have one or more
                            deputies and a staff. The Joint Committee shall determine its own
                            procedures, and arrange for such auxiliary organs and administrative
                            services as may be required. The Joint Committee shall be so organized

                        <p rend="center">Criminal Jurisdiction</p>
                        <p>1. Pending the coming into force with respect to the United States of the
                            “Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding
                            the Status of their Forces”, signed at London on June 19, 1951, United
                            States service courts and authorities shall have the right to exercise
                            within Japan exclusive jurisdiction over all offenses which may be
                            committed in Japan by members of the U.S. armed forces, the civilian
                            component, and their dependents. Such jurisdiction may in any case be
                            waived by the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. While the jurisdiction provided in the above paragraph is effective,
                            the following provisions shall apply:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. Japanese authorities may arrest members of the United States
                                armed forces, the civilian component, or their dependents for the
                                commission or attempted commission of an offense, but in the event
                                of such an arrest, the individual or individuals shall be
                                immediately remanded to the custody of the United States armed
                                forces.</item>
                            <item>b. The United States armed forces shall have the exclusive right
                                to arrest within facilities and areas in use by United States armed
                                forces. The United States armed forces may arrest any person whose
                                conduct in or near such a facility or areas affects the security of
                                that facility or area. Any person not subject to the jurisdiction of
                                the United States armed forces shall immediately be remanded to the
                                custody of Japanese authorities.</item>
                            <item>c. The United States armed forces may arrest members of the United
                                States armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents,
                                anywhere within Japan, and may travel throughout Japan for the
                                purpose of maintaining order and discipline of members of the United
                                States armed forces, the civilian component, and their
                                dependents.</item>
                            <item>d. The authorities of the United States and Japan shall cooperate
                                in making available witnesses and evidence for criminal proceedings
                                in their respective tribunals and shall assist each other in the
                                making of investigations. In the event of a criminal contempt,
                                perjury, or an obstruction of justice before a tribunal which does
                                not have criminal jurisdiction over the individual committing the
                                offense, he shall be tried by a tribunal which has jurisdiction over
                                him as if he had committed the offense before it.</item>
                            <item>e. The United States armed forces shall have the exclusive right
                                of removing from Japan members of the U.S. armed forces, the
                                civilian component, and their dependents. The United States will
                                give sympathetic consideration to a request by the Government of
                                Japan for the removal of any such person for good cause.</item>
                            <item>f. Japanese authorities shall have no right of search or seizure
                                with respect to any property within facilities and areas in use by
                                United States, or with respect to property of the United States <pb xml:id="pg_1112" n="1112" facs="0056"/>armed forces wherever
                                situated. Japanese authorities shall have no right of search or
                                seizure with respect to the persons or property of members of the
                                United States armed forces, the civilian component, or their
                                dependents, except as to such persons as may be arrested in
                                accordance with paragraph 2a of this Article.</item>
                            <item>g. A death sentence shall not be carried out in Japan by the
                                United States armed forces if the legislation of Japan does not
                                provide for such punishment in a similar case.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>3. The United States undertakes that the United States service courts and
                            authorities shall be willing and able to try and, on conviction, to
                            punish all offenses against the laws of Japan which members of the
                            United States armed forces, civilian component, and their dependents may
                            be alleged on sufficient evidence to have committed in Japan, and to
                            investigate and deal appropriately with any alleged criminal offense
                            committed by members of the United States armed forces, the civilian
                            component, and their dependents, which may be brought to their notice by
                            Japanese authorities or which they may find to have taken place.</p>
                        <p>4. Upon the coming into force with respect to the United States of the
                            North Atlantic Treaty Agreement referred to in paragraph 1, above, the
                            United States will immediately conclude with Japan, at the option of
                            Japan, an agreement on criminal jurisdiction similar to the
                            corresponding provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty Agreement.
                            However, in the event such option is not exercised by Japan, the
                            jurisdiction provided for in the foregoing paragraphs shall continue in
                            effect. In the event the said North Atlantic Treaty Agreement has not
                            come into effect within one year from the effective date of this
                            Agreement, the United States will, at the request of the Japanese
                            Government, reconsider the subject of jurisdiction over offenses
                            committed in Japan by members of the United States armed forces, the
                            civilian component, and their dependents.</p>

                            contained in this Article avoids discrimination against the Japanese in
                            that it commits the United States, at the option of Japan to conclude
                            with Japan an agreement on criminal jurisdiction similar to the
                            corresponding provisions of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Status of Forces Agreement as soon as the latter agreement comes into
                            force with respect to the United States. In the period before the coming
                            into effect of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of
                            Forces Agreement, the attached solution would provide for exclusive
                            jurisdiction by our own service courts and authorities over all offenses
                            which may be committed in Japan by members of the U.S. armed forces, the
                            civilian component and their dependents. Because of the wide variety of
                            arrangements which we now have with other countries, pending the
                            effective operation of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status
                            of Forces Agreement, it is impossible to draft an arrangement with Japan
                            which is exactly parallel to any considerable number of our present
                            arrangements with other countries. However we feel that there are
                            sufficiently adequate precedents now existing for the interim
                            application of exclusive jurisdiction as to give the Japanese no
                            legitimate cause for alleging discrimination. This is particularly true
                            since the Japanese will have an opportunity to choose the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula when the United States
                            ratifies the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Agreement.</p>

                        <p>1. The State Department “Draft Administrative Agreement Between the
                            United States of America and Japan” dated 21 December 1951 has been
                            referred by the State Department to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            for its views.</p>
                        <p>2. Along with Article XV titled “Criminal Jurisdiction” (State Draft) is
                            an Article XV titled “Criminal Jurisdiction and Related Matters”
                            (Defense Draft). <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> favors the Defence
                            Draft because the latter provides for immunity from arrest for United
                            States Armed Services civilian component and dependent personnel by
                            Japanese authorities except for actions involving serious injury or
                            death to individuals, whereas the State Draft places such persons in
                            jeopardy for any offense committed under Japanese law.</p>
                        <p>3. I feel strongly that United States personnel in post-treaty Japan are
                            entitled to a degree of U.S. protection and immunity from local arrest
                            not normally accorded to foreigners because of the nature of their
                            duties. Those negotiating the administrative agreement with the Japanese
                            should attempt to secure this protection to the maximum extent possible
                            without jeopardizing our overall national policy objectives in
                                Japan.<note n="2" xml:id="d485fn2">In a reply of Feb. 4, <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> stated that agreement on
                                the compromise draft Article XV had already been reached by the time
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName>’s memorandum had
                                been received. “Basically, it was agreed that upon the coming into
                                force of the North Atlantic Treaty Agreement the United States will
                                immediately conclude with Japan an agreement on criminal
                                jurisdiction similar to the corresponding provisions of the North
                                Atlantic Treaty Agreement. In the interim it is proposed that
                                criminal jurisdiction be exercised along lines proposed in the
                                Defense Draft to which you refer.” (611.94/1–2252)</note>

                        <p>I discussed with the President the relation between the ratification of

                            press forward with the ratification of the treaties and that it would be
                            a great misfortune to have action delayed or withheld pending the
                            completion of the administrative agreement. He told me that Senator

                            that the appropriate authorities here trust that the Prime Minister
                            would be able to develop a program which would include his ideas as to
                            the role which would be played respectively by his people and by our

                            course of action. The general substance of our outgoing cable was
                            discussed with you.</p>
                        <p>Under date of 12 January 1952, we received a reply from our Senior
                            Representative in Tokyo stating that he was authorized by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> to advise us that he
                            is thoroughly in accord with the procedure outlined and that he will
                            take it up with the Prime Minister at an early date and will then advise

                                    assistance is based largely on the use of business agents for
                                    the sale of cheap merchandise, such as cotton goods. Such agents
                                    would move via Formosa and Southeast Asia, not through

                            chain in the Western Pacific is in no way dependent on the perpetuation
                            of United States political control, by virtue of a United Nations
                            trusteeship or other device, over the Ryukyu Islands, and that there is
                            no reason to suppose that the United States and Japan could not reach
                            satisfactory arrangements retaining under United States long-term
                            control such facilities in the Ryukyu Islands as are deemed essential by

                            control. However, he believes that this action should be deferred until
                            the Treaty has been ratified and must be absolutely conditional upon a
                            firm agreement with Japan to retain under our exclusive control such
                            military facilities in the islands as are deemed essential by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The conclusions reached by the Far East Command coincide with the early
                            views of the Department that the Ryukyus should be returned to Japanese
                            political and administrative control. As early as June, 1946, the
                            Department proposed in <gloss target="#t_SWNCC1">SWNCC</gloss> 59/1<note n="3" xml:id="d488fn3">Not printed.</note> that the islands should
                            be retained by Japan and demilitarized; however, this view was strongly
                            contested by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, who maintained
                            that the United States should obtain sole trusteeship over the area.
                            Subsequently, after Mr. Kennan’s trip to Japan in early 1948, the
                            Department modified its position to the extent of supporting the
                            retention of United States military installations in the Ryukyus on a
                            long-term basis, with appropriate international arrangements regarding
                            the disposition of the islands to be made at a later date; and on
                            January 12, 1950 you stated in your extemporaneous talk at the National
                            Press Club, “We hold important defense positions in the Ryukyu Islands
                            and these we will continue to hold. In the interest of the population of
                            the Ryukyu Islands, we will at an appropriate time offer to hold these
                            islands under trusteeship of the United Nations.”<note n="4" xml:id="d488fn4">For text of <persName corresp="#p_ADG1">Acheson</persName>’s remarks, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, Jan. 23, 1950, p. 111.</note>
                            However, the eventual treaty provision on the subject (Article 3) was
                            worded in such a manner as not to bind the <pb xml:id="pg_1118" n="1118" facs="0062"/>United States to any specific course of action. Under
                            this Article the views of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> were
                            accommodated to the point of giving the United States an option of
                            seeking a trusteeship over Nansei Shoto south of 29° north latitude,
                            Nampo Shoto south of Sofu Gan and Parece Vela and Marcus Island
                            (hereafter referred to simply as the Ryukyus and Bonins); and pending
                            the making of a trusteeship proposal and affirmative action thereon, the
                            right to exercise any and all powers of administration, legislation, and
                            jurisdiction over the islands and their inhabitants. The Article does
                            not deprive Japan of sovereignty over the islands, nor does it require
                            the United States to seek a trusteeship.</p>
                        <p>While Article 3 of the Treaty takes care of our immediate strategic
                            interests in the area, it has become increasingly apparent during the
                            past year that the assumption by the United States of a trusteeship over
                            the Ryukyus and Bonins would raise a number of problems which in the
                            long run might seriously affect the position of the United States in the
                            Pacific. In the first place, the nearly 1,000,000 inhabitants of the
                            islands are closely bound to Japan by ties of history, race, language,
                            family, and trade which date back several centuries, and there has been
                            increasing evidence that an overwhelming majority of the population
                            actively advocates the return of the islands to Japanese control. It has
                            been estimated that during the summer of 1951, 99% of the adult
                            population of Amami Gunto (the northern Ryukyus) signed petitions
                            requesting that the area be returned to Japan. Similar petitions
                            circulated in Okinawa and the Southern Ryukyus are reported to have been
                            signed by 74% and 80% of the adult population respectively.</p>
                        <p>Article 3 of the Treaty has also given rise to dissatisfaction among the
                            Japanese, who regard the Ryukyus and Bonins as historically Japanese and
                            an integral part of the Japanese homeland. This dissatisfaction has not
                            been confined to leftist and rightist elements in Japan which are
                            unfriendly to the United States; it has also been voiced by liberal
                            groups who feel that the provision is contrary to the spirit of
                            reconciliation and mutual trust inherent in the rest of the Treaty.
                            Consequently, despite the fact that Japan has accepted the Treaty, it is
                            probable that irredentist sentiment with regard to the Ryukyus and
                            Bonins will persist.</p>
                        <p>A further consideration arises in the responsibilities which the United
                            States would be required to assume as the administering authority for a
                            trust territory of the islands. In general, both as a result of
                            traditional United States policies in the administration of dependent
                            areas and of the obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter,
                            the United States would be expected to bring about the progressive
                            improvement of political, economic, social and educational conditions in
                            the area.</p>

                        <p>In this connection, as noted in Attachment 4,<note n="5" xml:id="d488fn5">This attachment was a memorandum, not printed, entitled

                            Trusteeship Council would probably show special concern with regard to
                            the development of self-government and the allocation of governmental
                            posts to local inhabitants; the establishment of sound economic programs
                            with particular reference to conservation, protection of the inhabitants
                            against exploitation, customs duties, and land alienation; measures for
                            social and educational advancement; the encouragement of human rights
                            and fundamental freedoms, including investigation of evidence of
                            discrimination; and equal treatment in social, economic and commercial
                            matters for all United Nations members. The United States would also be
                            obligated to submit annual reports to the Trusteeship Council, to send a
                            special representative to Council hearings to reply to questions raised,
                            to admit visiting United Nations missions to the area, and to permit the
                            local inhabitants to petition the Council.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the problem of close United Nations supervision over the
                            territory which might at some time result in criticism of United States
                            policies in that forum, particularly in regard to the possible
                            alienation of land for military purposes, trusteeship may raise
                            political difficulties with the inhabitants, the great majority of whom
                            desire that the islands be returned to Japan. Furthermore, the
                            possibility that the area, which is seriously deficient in food, basic
                            raw materials, and industry could ever become self-sufficient, is
                            remote, and the islands will be an economic liability to any
                            administering power.</p>
                        <p>A number of other countries, notably India, have been sensitive to the
                            provisions of Article 3 of the Peace Treaty, choosing to regard it as a
                            device to perpetuate Western imperialism. While there is no reason to
                            believe that the United States would be unable to conclude a trusteeship
                            agreement with the United Nations, it is possible that the anti-colonial
                            bloc in the United Nations would seek to assure that any trusteeship
                            proposal submitted by the United States not subordinate the welfare of
                            the native population to security considerations. It is also possible
                            that the question of a time limit for trusteeship status might be
                            raised. On the other hand, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand
                            would probably prefer that the United States assume trusteeship over the
                            Ryukyus and Bonins in order to check any possible future moves on the
                            part <pb xml:id="pg_1120" n="1120" facs="0064"/>of Japan to expand
                            southward. However, the present security agreements between the United
                            States and those three countries offer them satisfactory protection, and
                            they would probably raise no strong objection to the return of the
                            islands to Japanese political control provided United States forces
                            remain in the area on a long-term basis.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, I believe that it would be
                            unwise for the United States to proceed to exercise its option under
                            Article 3 of the Treaty of seeking a trusteeship over the Ryukyus and
                            Bonins. The pronounced feeling on the part of the inhabitants favoring a
                            return to Japanese control, irredentist sentiment in Japan, the
                            depressed economic status of the islands, and the problems which might
                            be raised by continuing full United States responsibility for the
                            administration of the area are liabilities which the United States
                            should seek to avoid if it is possible in any other way to safeguard
                            United States strategic interests in the Ryukyus and Bonins. This view
                            is now held by General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>
                            and his command; and while the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have
                            not indicated to the Department any change in their previous view that
                            we should seek a trusteeship over the islands nor informed us of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>’s position, I
                            believe that we should again raise the matter with Defense in an effort
                            to find some means of ensuring our strategic interests in the islands
                            without exercising political control over them.</p>

                                the return of the islands to Japanese control provided the United
                                States may retain control over such military facilities in the

                            Administrative Agreement is so similar to the present Occupation that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> Government will press
                            for a number of changes in the draft, that there may be a significantly
                            adverse public reaction to any Agreement substantially in the form of
                            the present draft, and that future US-Japan relations might thereby be
                            seriously prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>2. The property and jurisdiction aspects of the draft Agreement appear to
                            provide no immediate important change in the status of the US forces
                            upon the coming into force of Peace Treaty, although US authorities will
                            no longer have extensive criminal diction over Japanese and there is the
                            prospect of some change in the indefinite future the Joint Committee in
                            respect to property and the coming into force of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Agreement regarding legal status of
                            forces. The financial burden to be borne under the proposed Agreement,
                            though not precisely comparable to the present cost of Occupation, is
                            undeniably a very considerable one which will probably arouse grave
                            misgivings in Japan.</p>
                        <p>3. We consider there is a real possibility that should the Agreement be
                            signed in substantially its present form, Japanese of all political
                            persuasion will be seriously concerned that the Occupation is being
                            continued under another name, while leftists and intellectual groups,
                            already hostile to or suspicious of the United States, may take a
                            position of strong opposition to the Administrative Agreement as well as
                            to the Security Treaty and Peace Treaty and may be joined in this
                            opposition by reemerging rightist elements averse to the present
                            Japanese Government and eager to reassert their political strength.</p>
                        <p>4. We believe it probable that as a minimum the Japanese negotiators will
                            want to study the draft Agreement at some length and <pb xml:id="pg_1122" n="1122" facs="0066"/>will propose extensive
                            revisions in wording and arrangement.<note n="2" xml:id="d489fn2">On
                                Jan. 29 the Japanese Government submitted to U.S. negotiators a

                                Administrative Agreement of December 21, 1951”. (Tokyo Post files,

                                principal concerns of the Japanese Government regarding the
                                Administrative Agreement are illustrated in the documentation of the
                                actual negotiations.</note> We do not discount the possibility that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> Government may
                            hesitate to associate itself with the Agreement if the substance of the
                            present draft is retained in all major respects.</p>
                        <p>5. We appreciate that the Agreement in its present form represents the
                            considered view of the US Government and we do not propose at this point
                            to raise matters of substance. We do, however, feel it important for
                            political reasons in Japan that the Japanese should be given full
                            opportunity to study and discuss the draft Agreement. Press reports from
                            Washington indicate that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> desire
                            conclusion of the Administrative Agreement as a condition precedent to
                            US ratification of the Peace Treaty, and that the Senate may be prepared
                            to act favorably within two or three weeks. We feel that any pressure
                            brought to bear on the Japanese to sign the Agreement within two or
                            three weeks would have particularly unfortunate results. As Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was reported to have
                            observed before the Senate, the necessary number of ratifications of the
                            Treaty are not likely to be deposited for several months even if the
                            United States should ratify in the next few weeks, and this period of
                            several months should provide more reasonable opportunity for the
                            Japanese to consider the proposed Agreement.</p>

                        <p>By mutual agreement the above listed members of the U.S. and Japanese
                            Delegations meet at 10:15 a.m. today in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>’s apartment to discuss informally
                            certain outstanding problems relating to the substance of the draft
                            Administrative Agreement.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of draft Articles I, VI, VII, and VIII.]</p>
                        <p>Turning to Article II (Facilities and Areas), Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed this article lies at the
                            heart of the Administrative Agreement. He stated that it was his
                            impression that our two Governments are in general agreement as to the
                            necessity of recognizing the end of the Occupation and of concluding <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi> arrangements to cover the post-Treaty
                            period, but that the problem is to find a practical solution. It is in
                            search of such a solution, he added, that we have proposed the formula
                            set forth in Article II of our draft. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that our principal
                            concern in drafting this article was to prevent a legal lapse in our
                            occupancy of certain facilities in order that we would not for even the
                            shortest time be in the status of trespassers on the properties which we
                            might be occupying. He said that he wished to emphasize, however, that
                            we would be most anxious to begin discussions, in the Joint Committee or
                            otherwise, with a view to resolving the question of facilities and
                            areas. He then inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> as to the views of the Japanese Delegation on
                            how this problem might be worked out as a practical matter.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> replied that the
                            principal reason for the suggested deletion of the third sentence of
                            paragraph 1 of Article II was that certain Army and Navy units of the
                            Occupation Forces have recently renewed the requisitioning of property
                            in Yokosuka and other areas. He said that this had given rise to a
                            suspicion among the Japanese people that the Occupation Forces are
                            trying to lay their hands on as much property as possible before the
                            Treaty comes into effect in order to be in a position to retain it
                            during the post-Treaty period. He said that the Japanese amendment had
                            therefore been proposed for reasons of public opinion, in which
                            connection he felt it to be very important. Although stating that we had
                            no knowledge of such recent instances of requisitioning, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Johnson</persName> called attention to
                            the fact that if U.S. Forces are to move out of urban areas, as the
                            Japanese appear to desire, they must have alternative facilities
                            elsewhere to which they can move. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> acknowledged that fact, and went on to say that,
                            as a practical matter, the Japanese would favor the commencement of
                            informal talks concerning the release of facilities as soon as possible,
                            perhaps even before the conclusion of the Administrative Agreement. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> interjected that if
                            we could settle the problem of facilities and areas before the
                            conclusion <pb xml:id="pg_1124" n="1124" facs="0068"/>of the
                            Administrative Agreement, which he regarded as a real possibility, the
                            third sentence of paragraph 1 of Article II would not be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he
                            appreciated the problem of Japanese public reactions to this question
                            and said that he would like to put forth informally and on his own
                            responsibility a suggestion which he believed might help to meet this
                            problem. He went on to say that his suggestion was that it be made clear
                            in the language of Article II that the use of facilities and areas by
                            U.S. Forces under the Administrative Agreement would be on a new and
                            different basis foliowing the end of the Occupation—namely, a basis of
                            mutual agreement and not of requisition or procurement demand. He stated
                            that such a formula would help to emphasize the changed status of our
                            occupancy of certain facilities which we might be obliged to retain
                            until such time as the Joint Committee could make alternative
                            arrangements, and that it would help to avoid a situation in which we
                            might become illegal occupants of such facilities.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated that it
                            certainly is not the intention of his Government to inconvenience the
                            U.S. Forces in the matter of facilities and areas, and that if
                            arrangements could not be made in time, some temporary expedient would
                            be found to legalize their occupancy of any facilities which they might
                            need to retain. He went on to say, however, that he was strongly of the
                            opinion that, for the reasons which he had cited, the third sentence of
                            Article II should be deleted.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed the
                            belief that our two Governments were in general agreement on this
                            question and that the problem was to find some means of giving written
                            expression to that agreement. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> emphasized again that the important
                            consideration from the point of view of Japanese public opinion is that
                            the retention of facilities by U.S. Forces be by mutual agreement and
                            not by procurement demand, i.e. not through a continuation of the
                            occupation. This, he stated, was the only purpose behind their suggested
                            amendment of Article II.</p>
                        <p>Following a brief conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> advanced the suggestion that the Japanese
                            amendment of Article II might be broadened to include an understanding
                            that the substance of the deleted third sentence would be incorporated
                            in an explanatory note or an exchange of letters outside the body of the
                            Agreement. In response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>’s question concerning the advisability of
                            concluding any secret understandings outside the Agreement, Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said that it would be
                            his suggestion that such exchange of notes be made public along with the
                            main Agreement. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            suggested that our two Delegations <pb xml:id="pg_1125" n="1125" facs="0069"/>consult further on this matter, and reiterated that our
                            concern was that we not be placed in the position of being trespassers
                            on Japanese properties after the end of the Occupation.</p>
                        <p>Stating that he believed it might be useful to Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then proceeded to explain some of
                            the background of our draft of Article XV (Criminal Jurisdiction).
                            Following this exposition, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> expressed the view that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula would be ideal for Japan but
                            that there would be technical difficulties in its adaptation, primarily
                            because of the absence of a Japanese military establishment. He stated
                            that the Japanese are grateful for the option given them under Article
                            XV but that he feared that the formula for the interim period would be
                            difficult to defend because of the fact that it accorded treatment
                            inferior to that accorded under the Philippine Bases Agreement.<note n="1" xml:id="d490fn1">For text of the agreement concerning military

                            hand, hold out the promise of treatment more favorable than that
                            accorded the Philippines, and that the provisions covering the interim
                            period before the effective date of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement are not substantially less favorable than
                            those which have been in effect since 1942 with respect to the status of
                            U.S. Forces in the United Kingdom. In this connection he emphasized
                            that, while the U.S. Government is determined that Japan shall not be
                            discriminated against in the matter of jurisdiction, it is also of great
                            importance in the relations between the U.S. and its other allies that
                            there be no discrimination against them and in favor of Japan. He went
                            on to say that the interim period provided for before the going into
                            effect of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula would, in
                            fact, give the Japanese Government and the U.S. Forces the time which
                            would required on both sides to prepare for the transfer to the Japanese
                            authorities of the much broader jurisdictional responsibilities embodied
                            in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> concept. In response to
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>’s question as to
                            the probable time of U.S. Senate action on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed personally and informally the opinion
                            that such action would probably be taken at some time during the current
                            calendar year.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> then asked if
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> could give him an
                            exposition of our views concerning Article XXII (Defense Measures), in
                            response to which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            explained the background of the necessity for laying the ground work for
                            prompt and effective joint action in the event of hostilities or
                            threatened hostilities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> stated that his Government agrees in principle
                            with the substance of that article but that they greatly fear the <pb xml:id="pg_1126" n="1126" facs="0070"/>reaction of the Japanese
                            public to Article XXII as written, particularly from the point of view
                            of its constitutional implications. In response to a question from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> added that it is paragraph 2
                            of that article which gives them the greatest concern.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the agenda for this afternoon’s formal meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d490fn2">A brief summary of this meeting is in telegram 1590

                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that we might
                            begin by agreeing on the revised Preamble, bypass Articles I and II for
                            the time being, and pick out certain articles on which there appeared to
                            be substantial agreement for final drafting by technical subcommittees.
                            He further suggested that, if such procedure was agreeable to the
                            Japanese Delegation, a press statement to the foregoing fact be prepared
                            for release following the meeting.</p>

                        <p>We have received an advance copy of the comments of the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff<note n="2" xml:id="d491fn2">Memorandum by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to the Secretary of Defense dated

                            their own. So far as the Policy Guidance is concerned, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have no objection except for one minor
                            point which arises through a misunderstanding. We believe this

                        <pb xml:id="pg_1127" n="1127" facs="0071"/>
                        <p>On the other hand the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are in complete
                            disagreement with both the substance and timing of the Draft Directive.
                            The chief points made by them are as follows:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. The general theory of moving out of downtown areas of Japanese
                                metropolitan centers is fine, but there are practical difficulties.
                                In particular the Dai Ichi Building should be retained so long as
                                military operations in Korea continue or any other major military
                                operations in the Far East are in process.<note n="3" xml:id="d491fn3">
                                    <p>The Joint Chiefs also stated on this
                                        point:</p>
                                    <p>“The Joint Chiefs of Staff are in agreement with General
                                            <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>’s view
                                        that for purposes of prestige, as well as for military
                                        reasons, his headquarters should be located in Tokyo during
                                        the post-treaty period.”</p>
                                </note>
                            </item>
                            <item>2. No Directive should be issued until the President has
                                determined post-Treaty relationships between <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> and the United States
                                Ambassador.</item>
                            <item>3. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> believe that the
                                Japanese situation demands special relationships between the
                                Ambassador and the military. In particular the <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> should retain full
                                responsibility for administering any military assistance program
                                even if it is necessary to amend existing legislation in order to
                                make it possible. In addition, on any matters “affecting the
                                security of <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>’s forces or
                                the execution of operational plans, as determined by <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>, the decision of <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>” should prevail pending
                                resolution of the issue in Washington.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs are transmitting their comments to <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>. We are sending a summary of them
                            by telegram to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and will
                            air pouch a copy of the detailed comments. As soon as we know the nature
                            of the Defense letter of transmittal, we will have for you some
                            recommendations as to further action.<note n="4" xml:id="d491fn4">Documents in files 794.0221 and 611.94 for February 1952, indicate
                                that instead of the procedure described here, officials of both
                                Departments conferred informally, with the result that the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff prepared a new version of the draft directive, which
                                in its final form was transmitted to the Secretary of State under

                        <p>Re Article 1, to Jap’s objection inclusion of contractors and
                            subcontractors, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> re-emphasized
                            basic inequities of and US objection to taxation of US-appropriated
                            funds either directly or indirectly <pb xml:id="pg_1129" n="1129" facs="0073"/>by country in which such funds were spent for aid,
                            security or economic assistance. Japanese experience with contractors of
                            their own or foreign nationality unsatisfactory and unsavory.
                            Consequently, term is surcharged with political reaction for them.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested seeking
                            language which would eliminate specific reference to contractors but
                            retaining substance of meaning. Japs in essential agreement with this
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>Re Article 15, Jap questions were posed to force a restatement of US
                            basic thinking underlying US position, which <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> emphatically presented,<note n="3" xml:id="d493fn3">
                                <p>An excerpt from <persName corresp="#p_BNW1">Bond</persName>’s memorandum of this conversation follows:</p>
                                <p>“Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> then
                                    raised the question of Article XV on Criminal Jurisdiction.
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that,
                                    for reasons which he had pointed out the previous day, it would
                                    be difficult to depart substantially from the principles set
                                    forth in our draft, but that we might move ahead if there
                                    remained only technical and drafting problems. Minister
                                        <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> indicated that
                                    in principle the U.S. draft of Article XV is acceptable and that
                                    all he had in mind was further discussion by technical experts
                                    as to phraseology and other details. Referring to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>’s comments of the
                                    previous day concerning the probable necessity for certain
                                    changes in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula in
                                    its application to Japan, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that he wished, in a spirit of
                                    candor, to make it perfectly clear that, although we would be
                                    disposed to agree to appropriate adaptation of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula, we would not be able
                                    to accord to Japan more favorable treatment than that accorded
                                    to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said that
                                    was understood.” (611.94/2–2352)</p>
                            </note> whereupon Jap
                            suggested agreement to US proposal subject to satisfactory resolution by
                            Technical Committee. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed
                            and suggested simultaneous submission to Technical Committee of Article
                                14<note n="4" xml:id="d493fn4">Entitled “Respect for the Laws of
                                Japan”.</note> which met with Jap approval.</p>
                        <p>Re Article 2, <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> restated Jap
                            realization of and willingness to meet needs of US forces. Stated Jap
                            Govt’s political problems this respect would be greatly alleviated if
                            preliminary study by Joint Committee of Technical Experts could begin
                            thorough review of requirements Moreover his government is plagued by
                            Diet and opposition with questions of respective size of garrison and
                            magnitude of facilities and areas which will be required. He states
                            unknowns are major source of difficulty, not principle, as his govt is
                            desirous of meeting US needs fully.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated such committee would
                            need prior clarification of certain basic principles and admin agreement
                            for guidance, but he would consult with colleagues as to feasibility
                            such approach. Also indicated uncertain status Korean operation

                            to using part of 56 billion yen in new budget included under title

                        <p>Re Article 22, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> forestalled
                            additional discussion this article on grounds not prepared to discuss
                            specific Jap comments already received. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> restated his and <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s belief that as practical matter in case

                            restrictions, and public sensitivity, paragraph 2 this article was
                            causing real political concern. Substance indicated as being
                            satisfactory; wording politically inexpedient.</p>
                        <p>In summary, <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated admin
                            agreement following discussions now contains only two major politically
                            important issues for Jap Govt, i.e., facilities and areas Article 2, and
                            (defense measures Article 22. These articles they already agree to in
                            principle. Therefore, he believes mutually satisfactory agreement can be

                                    and U.S. Delegations on Jan. 28, a section reads:</p>
                                <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then
                                    stated that there was one other point which he wished to make

                                    and that was that the U.S. Government does not intend to use
                                    ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty as a club over the
                                    heads of the Japanese in connection with negotiation of the
                                    Administrative Agreement. He stated, however, that the
                                    legislative processes of the U.S. Government are such that
                                    Senate consideration of the Japanese Peace Treaty and the
                                    bilateral Security Treaty with Japan would be facilitated and

                                do not object to policy of third sentence;</item>
                            <item>(3) Japanese desire to register in some way other than face of
                                agreement that para two of Article III is included within rights

                        <p>Other points are requiring further discussion, but they are likely to
                            remain technical in character. We are continuing talks on basis present
                            US draft and are not asking for fresh instructions yet.</p>
                        <p>I feel that we shld try to get clearer basis of agreement, particularly
                            on Articles II and XXII, before peace treaty comes to Senate floor if
                            possible. Under no circumstances, however, shld it be intimated in any
                            way that timing peace treaty consideration is related to progress our

                            point where it appears gap Japanese and US positions has been virtually
                            closed on Article I. Gap narrowing Articles II and XV. No real progress
                            made Article XXII.</p>
                        <p>Tentatively, am approaching conclusion Japanese have fundamental
                            disagreement with US on substance this article though they still state
                            disagreement is not one of substance but of political sensitivity. We
                            have made no concessions on substance and no wording change Paragraph 1,
                            Article XXII. Have explored textual change without substantive change
                            Paragraph 2 this article. No finalization of either textual or
                            substantive changes will be agreed to without reference to Washington,
                            nor am I seeking additional instructions at this time.</p>
                        <p>Believe present progress and lack of progress negotiations warrant your
                            reviewing them in light of proposal by Senate to report treaty out of
                            committee this week. Feel strongly open debate Senate floor this time
                            would further add to burden of negotiations here. While am not
                            personally privy to overall considerations of policy and developments in
                            Far East, subject to that lack of knowledge still strongly believe that
                            administrative agreement should come into effect simultaneously with 2
                            treaties.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Nash</persName>: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> has asked me to raise the
                            question of the status of the Japanese Peace Treaty. We are concerned
                            about the speed with which the Treaty is going through the Senate and
                            the effect that Senate ratification might have on the negotiation of an
                            administrative agreement in Tokyo. The Senate Foreign Relations
                            Committee approved the Treaty yesterday. There is a possibility, perhaps
                            a probability, that the Treaty will be called up for formal ratification
                            in a week or two. We are very much disturbed about this. I spoke to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> about it and told him
                            that we thought that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            had agreed with General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName>
                            regarding the necessity of concluding a satisfactory administrative
                            agreement and security treaty before the ratification of the peace
                            treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> told the
                            Senators that he fully supported General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName>’s view on this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> now tells me that this is not
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ view. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> will have to speak to
                            the President and to the Chairman of the Armed Forces committee with the
                            object of deferring action on the peace treaty until we have the
                            administrative agreement. I only wanted to call this to your attention
                            and to let you know that we are unhappy about it. We have been
                            emphasizing this point for two years.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the directive to General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>, I have been negotiating with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> and the JSSC. I think we should
                            be able to go ahead vigorously with the administrative agreement and we
                            might possibly conclude it in 10 to 14 days. If the Japanese drag their
                            feet—and they might—we will have to hold up on the ratification of the
                            peace treaty.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1134" n="1134" facs="0078"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">Matthews</persName>: I don’t know much
                            about this problem but I will look into it. Could the matter be taken
                            care of by delay in the depositing of the ratification after the passage
                            of the treaty?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>: Once the Senate
                            ratifies the treaty our negotiating position is shot.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName>: We have been
                            worrying about this for two years. If we cannot do anything else, we
                            will have to hold up the depositing of the ratification until we get the
                            administrative agreement. It would be far better, however, if the Senate
                            did not ratify until we had the administrative agreement.</p>

                            substituting for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName>, on
                            the report given me by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">Matthews</persName> that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> might be going to speak to the President urging

                                <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Earl Johnson</persName> that certain
                            difficulties were being encountered with the Japanese on the
                            administrative agreement. I strongly urged that no such proposal should
                            be urged upon the President and that if it were I should be present to
                            discuss it. I pointed out that our information was that the treaty would
                            not come before the Senate until about the 18th and might well take a
                            week to go through the Senate. It seemed to me, therefore, that Messrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Johnson</persName> had plenty of time. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> said that this might
                            be true if the dates which I mentioned were the correct ones. However,
                            if the Japanese got the impression from the press that the ratification
                            of the treaty was a sure thing, they might prefer to drag out the
                            discussions. I replied that delaying the treaty in the Senate would not
                            help this matter and could get us into serious trouble. I said we would
                            be glad to discuss the ways of disabusing the Japanese of the idea that
                            ratification would be an easy matter.</p>

                            fisheries negotiation that Japan is coming into post-treaty period as

                            implications for US foreign policy formulation, is entirely confirmed by
                            present talks.</p>
                        <p>Fol articles tentatively agreed on basis texts already furnished Dept:

                            which still require closing of gap between two dels: 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 22
                            and 23. Since this category contain heart of our proposals brief
                            analysis each now fols:</p>
                        <p>Re: Article 1, Japs most reluctant include contractors, stateless persons
                            and nationals third states within definition civilian component. Here
                            they are using <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> precedents
                            strongly. Also in background is bad reputation Jap contractors, many of
                            whom evaded taxes and escaped obligations to other Japs by claiming
                            special contractual <pb xml:id="pg_1136" n="1136" facs="0080"/>relationship to occupation. Japs appear willing to deal with problem
                            contractors in special articles in such way as to protect
                            US-appropriated funds from taxation, but do not appear impressed with
                            our desire include contractors and contractors of contractors in broad
                            privileges and exemptions given by inclusion definition civilian
                            component. Stateless persons not important, but Japs object inclusion
                            nations third state within civilian component, probably because they do
                            not see clearly its necessity, because such are explicitly excluded in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula, and there are vague
                            fears about possible abuses this privilege by US in some way offensive
                            to Japs. No change in my instruction this article desired.</p>
                        <p>Re: Article 2, issue still revolves about third sentence para 1. Since
                            Japs appear willing to agree substance policy that we should not be left
                            in position possible trespasser, we are trying find alternative language
                            which will mean same thing as our original text. Any such language will
                            be furnished Dept for approval before agreement in view importance this
                            point. Japs consider our original language implies continuation
                            occupation and seem to fear foot dragging on our part in reaching
                            agreement on facilities and areas. They want assurance (a) that
                            occupation ends completely in every respect upon effective date peace
                            treaty, (b) that facilities and areas are held by our forces by
                            agreement, (c) that we will make urgent and fair effort to get agreement
                            facilities and areas, before effective date peace treaty if possible.
                            Machinery for latter would be informal working group working in advance
                            of formal joint committee which would reach provisional agreements
                            facilities and areas to be confirmed promptly by joint committee. Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> is prepared set up
                            US section such informal working group at once and I consider it must be
                            done just as soon as we can agree on text Article 2. In exchange for
                            assurances (a), (b) and (c), Japs appear willing to give us assurance
                            that we can remain in facilities and areas not yet agreed or provided
                            for, pending further consultation, which is essence our present third
                            sentence, para 1. No change instruction this art now desired, pending
                            submission new language.</p>
                        <p>Re: Art 3, Japs have continued raise tremendous objection inclusion of
                            para 2 in body agreement. They say they do not object substance and
                            would include this para in formal agreed minutes of negotiations as
                            agreed interpretation para 1. Our wording para 2 indicates its function
                            is to explain para 1. Jap objection is based upon fact that para 2 would
                            be obnoxious their public opinion because it is taken bodily from base
                            agreements and even includes items not listed in Phil base agreement.
                            They are unwilling use Phil as precedent, but where our proposals are
                            even more severe on them than on Phil, Jap reaction is strong. “Bases”
                            is bad word in Japan since it connotes extra territoriality, unequal
                            treaties, and suggestion <pb xml:id="pg_1137" n="1137" facs="0081"/>we
                            are digging in for long stay, such as 99 years. We have pointed out
                            admin agreement inevitably includes features normal both to status of
                            forces and base agreements, that failure to be specific in other
                            agreements has produced misunderstanding and that public should have
                            broad idea of meaning of para 1 so as not to be upset when we act in
                            sense of our para 2. Firm Jap reaction continues to be that insertion
                            para 2 “itself most regrettable and displeasing to the Jap people”. My
                            own view is that, on this issue, we should take the substance and give
                            on the form, perhaps trying to strengthen para 1 by specific reference
                            to alterations in facilities and areas. My recommendation is that I be
                            authorized to accept, if it becomes necessary, deletion para 2 from Art
                            III, subject to its being recorded in formal agreed minutes as agreed
                            interpretation para 1. <persName>Johnson</persName> concurs. Dept now
                            has instruction on this.</p>
                        <p>Re: Art 15, Japs have been trying hard to get modification interim
                            arrangement which would place them “in at least as favorable a position
                            as the Phils” prior to application <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            formula. Crux of issue is Jap desire insert new para reading as fols:
                            “Jap courts and authorities shall have the right to exercise
                            jurisdiction over any offense against the laws of Japan which is
                            committed outside the facilities and areas by members of the US Armed
                            Forces, the civilian component and their independents and the offended
                            party of which is a Jap national.” Insertion such para would require
                            insertion words “subject to para 3 of this art” after words “US service
                            courts and authorities” in para 1. Battery of arguments both sides are
                            those well known Dept and we have held firm line. Japs may be trying to
                            make strongest possible record effort in negotiation prior to final
                            acceptance our formula. They recognize importance application <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula at early stage but are
                            worried about ability opposition parties exploit interim arrangement
                            involving exclusive jurisdiction. No new instructions desired.</p>
                        <p>Re: Art 16, Japs are pressing for US share of 75 percent in para 3 (D) as
                            in Art 8, para 5 (e) of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement.
                            They claim no reason why Jap should be different from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, no connection between settlement
                            arrangements for general expenses and no real reason why US should not

                            importance we should attach to 50–50 formula. Also, Japs wish to include
                            Art 16 new para to cover <hi rend="italic">ex gratia</hi> payments as in
                            para 6, Art 8, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement. Request

                        <p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Nash</persName>: We have been
                            discussing an Interim Policy Guidance and an Interim Directive to the
                            Commander in Chief, Far East setting forth preliminary United States
                            policies with respect to Japan in the post-Treaty period. In the course
                            of these discussions we have agreed that it will be desirable to push
                            ahead with the preparation of a National Security Council paper on
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>I have asked the Office of Northeast Asian Affairs to prepare a draft of
                            such an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper which can then be
                            started through the normal <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            processes. However in commencing their consideration of such a paper,
                            they have discovered the desirability of a military estimate of certain
                            factors regarding the security of Japan, in order to make possible a
                            more intelligent approach to some of the major problems of policy.
                            Enclosed are four copies of a list of questions, the answers to which
                            would lay a firm groundwork for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>I realize that some of these questions have already been the subject of
                            considerable study, and that some of the answers have been communicated
                            to the Department in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName>’s
                            letter of January 10.<note n="1" xml:id="d499fn1">Reference uncertain.

                            that even tentative answers are possible we will all have a better basis

                            Japanese Govt recognizes necessity US forces act in own security in case
                            of emergency, that in such case forces should not be limited to
                            facilities and areas provided under administrative agreement,

                            such matters, but they have suggested fol text Article 22:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>“In the event of hostilities, or imminently threatened
                                hostilities, in the Japan area, the Govts of Japan and the US shall

                        </list>
                        <p>Fol points have been put forward by <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> as basis objection inclusion our draft
                            article:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(1) Our paragraph one does not grant us any powers which it would
                                not otherwise enjoy, but it might give Japanese public impression,
                                by indicating US would not be bound by administrative agreement,
                                that latter is mere scrap of paper.</item>
                            <item>(2) Action taken by us in Japan in event emergency must be
                                preceded or accompanied by such consultation as circumstances
                                permit. There would always be some Minister of State available for
                                consultation. In fact, commander would act at once and consultation
                                would be formality.</item>
                            <item>(3) US commander’s action would be limited in any event to
                                measures securing our forces until US Govt had acted “since Congress
                                declares war”. Necessity consult own govt affords commander
                                opportunity contact Japanese Govt.</item>
                            <item>(4) Our Article 22 goes considerably beyond reasonable
                                interpretation Article 3 of security treaty, since latter refers to
                                “disposition of US forces in and about Japan”.</item>
                            <item>(5) Diet itself would consider commitments our Article 22 go
                                beyond Article 3 security treaty and might insist upon legislative
                                review entire agreement, in which Article 22 would run into great
                                trouble.</item>

                                of this conversation (held on Feb. 4) by Charles N. Spinks, First

                            interest is now ranging far beyond administrative agreement and that
                            Japanese wish to know whether we intend to consult Japan about security
                            matters, what arrangements we have in mind for command, and what steps
                            we have in mind for moving toward general security pact in Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Press interest here is turning toward broad security questions which are
                            not answered by our Article 22 but which would be further stimulated
                            thereby. Examples such questions are: Do we intend to claim right to use
                            atom bombs from Japanese bases without consulting Japan? Will security
                            measures be such as to make Japan independent only in name but in fact a
                            colony of the US? What will be the relation of Japan’s police reserve to
                            US forces? What role will US play in training police reserve? Who will
                            command? Will US forces put Japan through air raid drills in time of
                            peace? Will active use US forces be decided by US alone or by mutual
                            consultation and agreement? Who will decide what “contributing to the
                            maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East” means
                            in the security treaty? Recurring question is that of previous
                            consultation and agreement with Japan.</p>
                        <p>We have made fol points among others to <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> in support our Article 22:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(1) Inescapable consequence of very existence of armed force,
                                regardless where stationed, is that it must act in own security in
                                event emergency and we cannot accept limitation this basic
                                necessity, particularly in view our heavy world-wide
                                responsibilities.</item>
                            <item>(2) Facilities and areas agreed under administrative agreement
                                must not limit action which has to be taken as matter military
                                necessity in case of emergency.</item>
                            <item>(3) Our draft entirely appropriate in administrative agreement as
                                involving “conditions which shall govern the disposition, etc.”
                                specified in Article 3 security treaty.</item>
                            <item>(4) Under present conditions, where sudden and damaging attack can
                                be delivered by lawless nations, action of forces to provide own
                                security cannot be subject to limitations of communication and
                                consultation. <pb xml:id="pg_1143" n="1143" facs="0087"/>Examples
                                such sudden attacks past 20 years used, including Korea, Pearl
                                Harbor and Philippines.</item>
                            <item>(5) Our Article 22 merely represents actual realities situation
                                and Japanese public should begin to face up to them if they are now
                                under illusions.</item>
                            <item>(6) Although administrative agreement cannot enlarge upon rights
                                in security treaty, it is equally true that it cannot diminish
                                them.</item>
                            <item>(7) In period in which Japan is virtually disarmed and incapable
                                of exercising strategic command, such command could only be
                                exercised by US; in such situation all forces capable contributing
                                to defense of Japan should be under such command. All such
                                arrangements, however, should be on basis consultation and agreement
                                Japanese Govt as provided our draft.</item>

                        <list>
                            <item>(a) We should have a clear understanding that the limitations of
                                the administrative agreement do not apply to security measures which
                                have to be taken in the event of hostilities or imminent threat
                                thereof.</item>
                            <item>(b) We should have a clear understanding that US forces must, in

                            <item>(c) We should accept principle of consultation, in event

                        <p>If above is correct as to what we really want, it might be possible to
                            get Japanese agreement on Article 22 which contains our first paragraph
                            and something like their proposal (above) as second paragraph, amended
                            by inserting “appropriate joint measures” after “with view to taking”.
                            Even so it might be necessary to make some reference to consultation
                            accompanying action taken under our paragraph one, consultation which
                            would be inevitable even though we could not subject necessary action
                            under our paragraph one to its results. Action Dept: What does US Govt
                            think of this suggestion?</p>
                        <p>We have not yet moved into techniques of heavy pressures re Article 22.
                            However, before we do so US Govt should carefully consider whether US
                            interests are best protected by heavy pressure to obtain our Article 22
                            from reluctant Japan or by silence this matter in agreement itself. The
                            more we talk now and publicly about such questions, the more
                            embarrassing questions will become, the more <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> will feel compelled to water down meaning of
                            agreement in statements to Diet and the more we shall undoubtedly <pb xml:id="pg_1144" n="1144" facs="0088"/>have to move toward statement
                            restricting wide open rights we now enjoy under security treaty, such as
                            commitments to consult of the sort recently given <persName corresp="#p_CWS1">Churchill</persName>. Best response <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> might now make to many questions
                            this field is that such matters not appropriately covered by
                            administrative agreement and should be left for further consideration

                            should know that I felt before leaving Washington that present Japanese
                            reaction was entirely predictable and that our interests would be best
                            protected by relying upon security treaty pending more general and
                            highly confidential talks between US and Japanese Govt this entire
                            field. I did not press this view to highest level then because <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> felt strongly about it and I thought we
                            could at least explore matter with Japs.</p>
                        <p>Your own consideration my No. 14 should take into account facts it
                            reflects to some extent views held prior to departure and also fact we
                            have not yet applied heaviest pressures in negotiation. I would regret
                            using up such pressures on Art XXII when we may need them for Arts II,
                            XV and XXIII which are far more important to us in substance than Art
                            XXII.</p>
                        <p>I feel we have best chance maintaining rights security treaty by working
                            with Japanese Govt on practical basis and not by rubbing their noses
                            publicly in formal statements or agreements which spell out satellite
                            status. Any attempt by us to claim that action US Forces in Japan is not
                            intimately related to Japan’s security, Japanese sovereignty and
                            responsibility Japanese Govt is bound to fail. We might get our
                            paragraphs on paper but lose sympathy and support our friends in Japan
                            who are carrying heavy load Japanese public opinion on such questions as
                            rearmament, budgetary difficulties, reparations, trade with mainland,
                            extensive facilities and areas needed by our forces.</p>

                                the government wanted the scope of the treaty’s application to be

                            certain differences which in themselves seem to us not to be of major
                            importance but which, in atmosphere of suspicion and distrust, cld be

                        <p>It is our present view that negots shld be begun directly between the two

                        <p>We were disposed in principle to accept position that formula now in

                            separate protocol doc rather than in treaty itself. However, we now feel
                            it may not be practical to exclude formula from treaty.</p>
                        <p>We note Chi draft<note n="4" xml:id="d502fn4">Chinese draft as of this
                                date not found in Department of State files.</note> repeats
                            provisions of multilateral Treaty giving rights to Natls, products and
                            vessels of the “Republic of China” and then apparently attempts to cut
                            down scope of rights by limiting them to Natls, products and vessels of
                            “Formosa and the Pescadores”. Even this however is not done
                            adequately.</p>
                        <p>This seems to us unsatis. It fails to reflect important feature of

                            in fact limits treaty operation for all time merely to islands
                            mentioned. We wld think it preferable a) that treaty be made between
                            “the Govt of Japan and the Natl Govt of the Republic of China”; b) that
                            treaty be simplified so as to reduce necessity for internal definitions;
                            and c) that final clause of the treaty limit its application to Natls,
                            products or vessels of China in terrs “now or hereafter under control of
                            Natl Govt of the Republic of China.”</p>
                        <p>We attach, and assume Natl Govt attaches, utmost importance to meticulous
                            avoidance of any treaty provision in favor of China which cld give
                            rights to Commie China other than contemplated by Art 21 of multilateral
                            Treaty or give rights to persons, products, vessels, aircraft or
                            anything else now or hereafter under Commie <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> control. Also we attach importance to the “hereafter”
                            feature of formula both to avoid any possible impairment internatl
                            prestige Natl Govt and also to avoid possible rights to Commies if
                            perchance any single particle of Formosa and Pescadores group shld
                            temporarily fall under <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Commie control.
                            Therefore, from both standpoints we believe treaty shld be with “Natl
                            Govt of Republic of China” and limited to its <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> control now or hereafter rather than to geographically

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>Article XXII constituted one of the major points of difference between
                            State and Defense, and it seemed likely that the decision would have to
                            be put up to the President. However, agreement was finally reached to
                            present to the Japanese a draft of Article XXII which provides for a
                            unilateral United States determination as to whether an emergency exists
                            and for the abrogation of the imposed by the Administrative Agreement if
                            necessary to carry out the purposes of Article I of the security Treaty
                            and to ensure the security of United States forces. A combined Command
                            with a United States Commander may be established by agreement with the
                            Government of Japan.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Current Negotiations With the Japanese</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have in these negotiations been taking the kind of position
                            that might be expected of a friendly sovereign nation. They have
                            informally expressed their willingness to do all that we ask in our
                            draft of the Administrative Agreement. However, because of domestic
                            political difficulties they cannot in a public document subscribe to
                            some of the commitments which we have requested them to make. This
                            situation applies particularly to Article XXII. There has been great
                            public concern in Japan over such questions as our possible use of
                            Japanese bases for atomic attacks upon China or Russia and possible
                            commitments for the use of Japanese forces. In our opinion, the Japanese
                            are not overestimating their domestic problem when they say that the
                            provision for the virtual abrogation of the limitations of the Agreement
                            in an emergency situation would undoubtedly create the impression among
                            the Japanese people that the Agreement is a “mere scrap of paper”.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have put forward as their proposal the following simple
                            statement:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>“In the event of hostilities, or imminently threatened
                                hostilities, in the Japan area, the Governments of Japan and the
                                United States shall immediately consult together with a view to
                                taking necessary measures to carry out the purpose of Article I of
                                the Security Treaty.”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This language does not give us a clear right to take necessary measures
                            to meet an emergency situation, and therefore will be unsatisfactory to
                            the Joint Chiefs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, with
                                <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Earl Johnson</persName>’s concurrence,
                            says that the following should be the chief elements of our
                            position:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) The limitations of the Administrative Agreement should not
                                apply in an emergency.</item>
                            <item>(b) The United States forces must act in an emergency to carry out
                                the purposes of the Security Treaty and to provide for their own
                                security.</item>
                            <item>(c) We should accept the principle of consultation on joint
                                measures which the United States and Japan might agree to take in an
                                emergency.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggests that we may find
                            it both necessary and desirable to go one step further and agree to
                            consultation even with respect to measures taken by the United States,
                            since such consultation would inevitably have to be undertaken even
                            though we could not make our necessary action subject to its results. He
                            also points out that in the negotiations we still have major
                            difficulties with respect to facilities and areas, the sharing of
                            expenses, and jurisdiction. <pb xml:id="pg_1149" n="1149" facs="0093"/>His belief is that we should not utilize our ammunition on this
                            article.</p>
                        <p>The last attachment<note n="2" xml:id="d503fn2">Printed below.</note> is
                            a draft of language which might be a reasonable compromise. I have
                            talked with <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Frank Nash</persName> about this
                            subject, and he believes that it may be possible to find a middle ground
                            which will be acceptable to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he is giving
                            our suggested language some further consideration.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                        <p>The United States Government should authorize Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to accept the principle of
                            consultation even with respect to the measures the United States forces
                            must take in an emergency. It should be left to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>’s discretion to achieve the best
                            possible result on Article XXII and the greatest advantage in the
                            negotiations from whatever concession is made to the Japanese viewpoint.
                            The chief reasons for the adoption of this recommendation follow:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. Consultation with the Japanese, even in an emergency, is
                                inevitable and would in any event be undertaken practically
                                simultaneously with action to meet the emergency.</item>
                            <item>2. United States interests are probably best protected by avoiding
                                public disclosure in the Agreement of the full extent of Japanese
                                willingness to cooperate with us in the event of an emergency.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s best line now
                                might be that these matters can most appropriately be left to
                                further consideration and consultation between the two
                                Governments.</item>
                            <item>3. However sweeping the language of the Agreement, it means
                                nothing unless we have the full and willing support of the Japanese
                                Government and people.</item>
                            <item>4. We need the support of the present Japanese Government for many
                                measures which are unpopular in Japan—rearmament, reparations,
                                restrictions on trade with mainland China, and facilities and areas
                                for our forces. We should avoid imposing any further burden upon
                                them unless it is absolutely necessary.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This subject will have to be taken up by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but
                            you may wish to discuss with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> the main questions of policy which are
                            involved.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Defense Measures</p>
                        <p>This Agreement assumes peace, not war. It assumes that the presence of
                            United States forces in and about Japan will deter attack and prevent
                            hostilities in the Japan area.</p>
                        <p>If these assumptions should prove not to be the case, and if there should
                            be hostilities or imminently threatened hostilities in the Japan area, a
                            new situation will have arisen the character of which cannot be
                            foreseen, and the Governments of Japan and the United States shall
                            immediately consult together concerning the necessary measures,
                            including appropriate joint measures, to carry out the purposes of
                            Article 1 of the United States–Japan Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In the event of such hostilities or imminently threatened hostilities the
                            Commander of the United States forces in and about Japan will have the
                            inherent rights of a field commander whose forces are subject to hostile
                            attack, to make such disposition of his forces in and about Japan as he
                            may judge to be required for their safety and the performance of their
                            mission.</p>

                        <p>You are authorized accept, if it becomes necessary to conclusion
                            Agreement, deletion para 2 subj to its being recorded in formal agreed

                        <p>We are concerned by proposal relegate to secret minutes matters which
                            shld be in agreement itself, for reasons indicated <gloss target="#t_urmsg1">urmsg</gloss>, and suggest that concession if

                        <p>Believe present comprehensive language of para 1 wld not be strengthened
                            by addition specific rights which cld be construed as limiting general

                        <p>Believe para 2 (g) not clearly within scope para 1 and therefore wld not
                            be adequately covered by inclusion in agreed minutes. This right must be
                            expressly included, perhaps in Article 11.</p>

                            shld be accepted by Jap. This need not be sticking point on entire negot
                            and desirability concession must be evaluated in light total negotiating

                            Proposed draft results from discussion <persName corresp="#p_DWW1">Diehl</persName>, <persName>Johnson</persName>, Hamblen, Morrison
                            and myself as effort simplification and clarity in further discussions
                            with Japanese. Principal objection our original language is its vague
                            and ill-defined concepts and difficulty in supporting with hard
                            figures.</p>
                        <p>Following para references to Washington draft article 23.</p>
                        <p>Para 1 dropped since phrases “relative contribution”, “total resources”
                            as interpreted by Japanese require unnecessary financial procedures of
                            controversial and impractical character. Binding this agreement to “any
                            comparable arrangements for collective security concluded by US with
                            other powers” opens way for Japs to secure copies of all such agreements
                            and under most-favored nation reasoning bargain for concessions granted
                            any other nation.</p>
                        <p>Para 2 retained in new draft with exception of parity principle. This
                            concept omitted as involving calculations based on unrealistic
                            definition of local costs.</p>
                        <p>Para 3 reworded without reducing either Japanese responsibility or
                            financial commitment.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1153" n="1153" facs="0097"/>
                        <p>Para 4 dropped as involving open end commitment by US to bear costs in
                            all “other” category. This may have to be reinserted to meet Japanese
                            arguments in favor of its inclusion.</p>
                        <p>In para 5, requirement for accurate accounting retained but statement of
                            principle dropped as unnecessary to satisfactory implementation this
                            article.</p>
                        <p>Para 6 dropped as superfluous.</p>
                        <p>Right of US to utilize dollar or yen funds lawfully acquired is
                            unquestioned. Consider inadvisable to indicate any Jap right to block
                            which is implied in para 6.</p>
                        <p>We understand language paras 1 and latter part para 2 intended primarily
                            as window dressing for eyes Japanese public. Consequently we believe
                            deletion desirable in view Japanese resistance to language.</p>
                        <p>Does Department see objection our using this draft as basis

                        </list>
                        <p>1. In accordance with the request contained in your memorandum dated 9
                            February 1952, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the cable from
                            the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (<gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>) to the Secretary of State (<gloss target="#t_DA1">DA</gloss> IN 102899, dated 8 February 1952)<note n="1" xml:id="d508fn1">Telegram 1649 from Tokyo, <ref target="#d500">Document 500</ref>.</note> in which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> queried his Department as to the
                            United States position regarding certain proposed changes in Article
                            XXII of the Draft Administrative Agreement Between the United States and
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>2. From the United States military point of view, not only the present
                            governmental authorities, but also all future governments of Japan
                            throughout the period in which the U.S. Japan Security Treaty is in
                            effect must, in the event of hostilities or imminently threatened
                            hostilities in the Japan area, be unequivocally bound to:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. Respect the rights of the United States to insure the security
                                of its forces in Japan; and</item>
                            <item>b. Consult with the Government of the United States with a view to
                                taking appropriate combined measures for the defense the Japan area,
                                such measures normally, and unless otherwise mutually agreed in the
                                light of the ability of Japan increasingly to assume responsibility
                                for its own defense, to include the establishment of a combined
                                command and the designation by the United States of a commander
                                thereof to exercise operational command over all United States
                                forces in the Japan area and over all Japanese security
                                organizations in Japan, except local police, capable of contributing
                                to the defense of Japan.</item>
                        </list>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1156" n="1156" facs="0100"/>
                        <p>3. The right to insure the security of United States forces in Japan (see
                            subparagraph 2a above) in the event of hostilities or imminently
                            threatened hostilities, must be specifically recognized by the
                            Government of Japan in order to insure that the Commander in Chief, Far
                            East will enjoy the requisite degree of freedom of action in providing
                            for this security. Such arrangements are an essential concomitant to the
                            retention of United States forces in a sovereign Japan.</p>
                        <p>4. Although it might be possible at some future date to make certain
                            adjustments in command arrangements, as warranted by increase in the
                            capability of Japan for its own defense, or by the coming into force of
                            such individual or collective security dispositions as are envisaged in
                            Article IV of the United States–Japan Security Treaty, the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff feel that the Administrative Agreement must include provision
                            for the establishment of a combined command and the designation of a
                            commander thereof by the United States without which the defense of the
                            Japan area will be jeopardized. This requirement, however, does not
                            preclude future review of these command arrangements.</p>
                        <p>5. In consonance with the foregoing, and in light of the developments in
                            the negotiations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that Article XXII
                            of the Draft Administrative Agreement with Japan be revised to read as
                            follows:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>“In the event of hostilities, or imminently threatened
                                hostilities, in the Japan area, the United States may take such
                                actions as may be necessary to insure the security of its forces in
                                the Japan area, and the Governments of Japan and of the United
                                States shall immediately consult together with a view to taking
                                necessary measures for the defense of that area and to carry out the
                                purpose of Article I of the Security Treaty. Pending the coming into
                                force of such individual or collective security dispositions
                                envisaged in Article IV of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty as will
                                satisfactorily provide for the maintenance of international peace
                                and security in the Japan area, it is agreed that a unified command,
                                under a commander to be designated by the United States, would be
                                established. This commander would exercise operational command over
                                all United States forces in the Japan area and over all Japanese
                                security forces in Japan, except local police, capable of
                                contributing to the defense of Japan. As Japan becomes capable of
                                assuming responsibility for its own defense, this arrangement may be
                                modified by mutual agreement.”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>6. It will be noted that the language suggested permits such necessary
                            adjustments as may be warranted by future increases in the capability of
                            Japan to provide for its own defense. Additionally, the language, by
                            reference to Article IV of the US-Japan Security Treaty, implies that
                            the suggested command arrangements may be subject to review in the
                            eventuality of the establishment of other <pb xml:id="pg_1157" n="1157" facs="0101"/>collective defense arrangements in the area. In any
                            event, reference to the establishment of a command organization for the
                            defense of Japan is necessary in order to provide the basis for
                            pre-planning for the contingency of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>7. In connection with all of the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            recommend that you insist that military considerations are overriding in
                            the requirement that the substance of the matter in paragraph 2 above be
                            included in the Administrative Agreement and that the United States
                            Government position be in consonance therewith.</p>

                            violence to the scope of the revised Article. The antepenultimate
                            sentence states”...<note n="2" xml:id="d510fn2">Ellipsis in the source

                            thereof.” It appears to me that a definition of what the commander might
                            do, as contained in the following sentence, is redundant and might, in
                            some respects, be considered as restrictive. Moreover, the commander of
                            a combined command in time of emergency would, of necessity, perform,
                            among other duties, the functions contained in the penultimate
                            sentence.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of tactics, I would suggest that the Japanese be approached
                            with the revised Article XXII, but that, in the meantime, authority be
                            requested as an ultimate position to omit the penultimate sentence.</p>

                        <p>1. Attached as Tab A is a draft memorandum for your approval containing
                            interim policy guidance with respect to Japan. This guidance is designed
                            primarily to anticipate political, military and administrative questions
                            that may arise in the development of the post-Treaty relationship
                            between the United States and Japan.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1160" n="1160" facs="0104"/>
                        <p>2. This Interim Policy is supplementary to, and does not supersede, the
                            current policies on Japan established by the National Security Council.
                            If it meets with your approval, we suggest that you submit it to the
                            National Security Council for its information, and that at the same time
                            you request the National Security Council to prepare a policy report on
                            Japan as soon as possible. If approved by you, the attached draft
                            memorandum should be considered interim national policy on Japan pending
                            the completion of the National Security Council policy report.</p>
                        <p>3. Attached as Tab B is a proposed Interim Directive to the Commander in
                            Chief, Far East concerning the Joint Committee provided in the
                            Administrative Agreement with Japan. The proposed directive is
                            intimately related to the Interim Policy and incorporates it by
                            reference. If approved by you, it will be issued by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff to the Commander in Chief, Far East as interim guidance and
                            authority concerning facilities and areas in Japan for use by United
                            States forces.</p>
                        <p>4. It is important that there be interim policy guidance for those who
                            are conducting United States relations with Japan in this difficult
                            period of transition before the Treaty of Peace becomes effective. The
                            attached documents will provide that guidance.</p>

                        <p>On the recommendation of the Secretaries of State and Defense, I have
                            approved the following interim policy with respect to Japan. This
                            interim policy is supplementary to, and does not supersede, the current
                            policies on Japan established by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. It will be in effect pending the completion of a policy
                            report on Japan which the National Security Council will now undertake
                            to complete.</p>
                        <p>1. The security of Japan is of such vital strategic importance to the
                            United States position in the Far East that the United States cannot
                            permit hostile forces to gain control of any part of the territory of
                            Japan. United States forces in Japan will be performing a security
                            mission of the highest importance to the United States national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>2. The overriding requirement for United States policy affecting all
                            post-Treaty arrangements with Japan is the necessity for preserving and
                            strengthening the voluntary and strong commitment of the Japanese
                            Government and people to a close association and to joint action with
                            the United States and the free world. The United States can attain its
                            long-range security objectives in the Far East to the fullest extent
                            only if Japan, in its own self-interest, fully recognizes its stake in
                            the free world, develops close political, military and economic
                            cooperation with the United States and other free nations, particularly
                            in Asia, and assumes its fair share of the common burdens of the free
                            world.</p>
                        <p>3. In as much as U.S. forces in Japan will be undertaking a security
                            mission of vital importance to the security of Japan and to the United
                            States, post-treaty arrangements for United States forces in Japan must
                            ensure that such forces are able to carry out their military mission,
                            and in particular, that the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, is afforded
                            the latitude and authority necessary to carry out his responsibilities
                            in case of hostilities or the threat of imminent hostilities. The
                            arrangements for the defense of Japan should be such as to permit all
                            security forces in Japan immediately to meet an attack on Japan which
                            could be launched without warning. The effective execution of this
                            military mission will depend, to a great extent, upon the continuing
                            agreement and consent of the Government of Japan.</p>
                        <p>4. To encourage Japan to become an effective, responsive and cooperative
                            partner, the United States must accord Japan the courtesy and
                            consideration to which her potential future role and her sovereign
                            position entitle her. The United States attitude toward Japan must
                            constantly show a tactful regard and a sympathetic understanding in all
                            relations with the Japanese in which the questions of prestige,
                            equality, status, sovereignty and “face” are involved, in view of the
                            particular sensitivity of the Japanese to various forms of
                            discrimination. The United States should in general <pb xml:id="pg_1162" n="1162" facs="0106"/>accord to Japan the same relationships which
                            exist between the United States and other friendly allies in whose
                            territory United States forces are stationed. On the other hand, the
                            United States should not create problems for itself in other countries
                            by making exceptionally favorable arrangements with Japan.</p>
                        <p>5. At the same time, the Japanese must be led to understand that the
                            United States–Japanese security arrangements are a common enterprise in
                            which the Japanese should be even more vitally interested than we, that
                            they are being assisted in meeting a responsibility basically their own,
                            and that it is incumbent upon them to do everything possible to reduce
                            or remove irritations and obstacles standing in the way of complete and
                            cordial cooperation in this field. Full use should be made of experience
                            in other areas to show the Japanese what “self-help and mutual aid” mean
                            in terms of joint action, joint contribution, and joint
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>6. Post-Treaty relationships between the United States and Japan will
                            have an important bearing upon United States relations with other
                            Governments and peoples in Asia and the Pacific. A genuinely voluntary
                            United States–Japanese partnership will add greatly to United States
                            prestige and influence throughout Asia; conversely, it will be
                            disastrous if it should develop that the presence of the United States
                            forces in Japan is contrary to the wishes of the Japanese themselves and
                            appears to the people of Asia to be an expression of “western
                            imperialism.”</p>
                        <p>7. United States programs and courses of action with respect to Japan
                            should be designed to promote Japan’s economic development, political
                            stability, and military contribution to the collective security of
                            non-Communist nations in Asia. To this end, the United States should
                            seek to preserve the positive accomplishments of the occupation to the
                            greatest extent possible; assist Japan in building up its industrial and
                            agricultural resources, in developing and maintaining a strong trading
                            position, particularly with Southeast Asia; and support the
                            establishment of Japanese military forces consistent with the
                            requirements of a sound economy and the needs of collective security in
                            the Far East.</p>
                        <p>8. All post-Treaty arrangements with Japan must be conducted in such a
                            way as to maintain and advance the prestige of the United States and its
                            representatives in Japan since such prestige is fundamental to
                            satisfactory United States–Japanese relations. It will depend upon many
                            factors including the political, economic, and military strength of the
                            United States, Japanese confidence in our continuing adherence to
                            underlying moral and political objectives which are in harmony with
                            those of Japan, the unity of view presented by United States officials
                            to the Japanese, and the respect and admiration for Americans as
                            individuals.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1163" n="1163" facs="0107"/>
                        <p>9. Post-Treaty arrangements for United States forces in Japan should be
                            such as to maintain the dignity, health, morale and prestige of these
                            forces while in Japan. On the other hand, every effort should be made to
                            prevent the security mission, the presence of United States forces in
                            Japan, and the security arrangements with Japan from becoming a domestic
                            political issue in Japan. Every reasonable effort should be made to
                            allay the anxieties of non-Communist elements regarding these matters,
                            including opposition parties, labor and intellectual groups. Both United
                            States and Japanese authorities should make continuous efforts to
                            develop cordial relations between the Japanese people and United States
                            personnel in Japan.</p>
                        <p>10. The principle of consultation between appropriate United States and
                            Japanese authorities on matters involving post-Treaty arrangements and
                            agreements should be observed. Minor irritations might be disposed of by
                            friendly and timely consultation on a local basis. Many questions of
                            prestige and public relations can be handled by evidences of joint
                            responsibility for action taken.</p>
                        <p>11. The latter portion of Article I of the Security Treaty is a provision
                            against an emergency arising from indirect attacks upon Japan by outside
                            powers. This article does not authorize interference by the United
                            States in Japanese domestic political affairs.</p>
                        <p>12. A continuous and intensive orientation and information program shall
                            be conducted among all United States military and civilian personnel in
                            Japan in support of the policies and principles outlined above, in order
                            to foster an attitude and conduct on the part of Americans which will
                            strengthen friendly relations between the United States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>13. Dealings with Japanese labor should be such as to preserve, and to
                            encourage the Japanese to preserve, the labor reforms achieved by the
                            occupation, and in particular to encourage as far as suitable the
                            development and strengthening of free labor union movements as the
                            collective bargaining agencies of labor.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Interim Directive to <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> Concerning the Joint Committee Provided in the
                            Administrative Agreement With Japan</p>
                        <p>1. This directive consists of interim guidance and authority for
                            conducting the United States participation in the Joint Committee
                            provided in Article XXIV of the draft Administrative Agreement with
                            Japan, and for the negotiations in this committee concerning facilities
                            and areas in Japan for use by United States forces as set <pb xml:id="pg_1164" n="1164" facs="0108"/>forth in Article II of the
                            above agreement. At an appropriate later date a more comprehensive
                            directive concerning post-treaty relationships between the United States
                            forces and Japan may be issued. It is expected, however, that such a
                            comprehensive directive would not essentially modify the provisions of
                            this directive. All previous instructions in conflict herewith are
                            rescinded.</p>
                        <p>2. General:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. An Administrative Agreement, called for in Article III of the
                                security treaty, is being negotiated between the Governments of the
                                United States and Japan. The United States draft of that agreement
                                has been furnished you separately. The final version as agreed upon
                                by the two governments will be considered as being incorporated by
                                this reference in this directive.</item>
                            <item>b. The interim policy guidance with respect to Japan which was
                                approved by the President on———is incorporated by this reference in
                                this directive.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>3. The Joint Committee (Article XXIV of the draft Administrative
                            Agreement):</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. You are authorized to designate the United States

                                Committee’s functions. However, prior to the coming into force of
                                the United States–Japan Security Treaty, the Joint Committee will
                                have no authority to make decisions in the manner intended by the
                                Administrative Agreement;</item>
                            <item>b. You will keep the United States Government informed of

                                of Staff. Directives will be transmitted to you by the Joint Chiefs
                                of Staff on all matters arising in the Joint Committee which require
                                such directives;</item>
                            <item>c. Upon the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace with Japan,
                                you will keep the United States Ambassador fully and currently
                                informed of all negotiations in the Joint Committee. The United
                                States Ambassador will furnish political advice to you on matters
                                before the Joint Committee and will designate a political officer to
                                assist the United States Representative on the committee;</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>4. Facilities and areas (Article II of the draft Administrative

                        <list>
                            <item>a. Your arrangements concerning facilities and areas for the use
                                of United States forces in Japan should at all times be consistent
                                with the following considerations:<list>
                                    <item>(1) The efficient execution of your military

                                        of Japanese security forces;</item>

                            <item>d. In anticipation of the ratification of the peace treaty,
                                appropriate steps, consistent with subparagraph 4 a above, should be
                                taken toward:<list>

                            <item>e. If there are inescapable delays in the necessary readjustments,
                                you should arrange for full and timely explanation to the Japanese
                                governmental authorities;</item>

                                interim use may be made thereof by the Japanese, where in your
                                opinion such use is not harmful to the purposes for which the

                        <p>1689. Reptd Secretary of Defense CX 63631. This is <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>’s 1689. No. 22 from <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. Coming next message is proposed
                            text amended Art 2 and exchange of notes subject third sentence our
                            original para 1. It now seems clear that we can get more satisfactory
                            commitment reference third sentence our para 1 in public exchange of
                            notes simultaneous with signing admin agreement than we can get on face
                            of agreement itself. Both <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>
                            and our State Dept lawyers consider that status and validity of an
                            agreement registered in exchange of notes is same as admin agreement
                            itself. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> says Jap practice
                            is same as international law that documents accompanying each other
                            registering agreement on same subject are “part and parcel of same
                            agreement”. Dept will wish assure itself this point.</p>
                        <p>Question then arises as to why Japs are unwilling to include commitment
                            in Art 2 itself. Reasons which have been given by Japs are:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. Our third sentence means to many Japs that occupation merely
                                continues into post treaty period; it is of utmost importance to
                                Japs that it be clear occupation ends on effective date peace
                                treaty, that holding of property by US forces for 90 days under Art
                                6 peace treaty is under that treaty and not under occupation
                                procurement demand, and that otherwise use of facilities and areas
                                by US forces is on basis agreement with Japan.</item>
                            <item>2. Our third sentence would greatly disturb many Japs, including
                                many otherwise friendly to US, who have grave doubts about degree of
                                urgency US forces will feel in placing arrangements on new basis of
                                agreement. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>, who states many Japs are expressing doubts
                                our “integrity” on this point, has emphasized desire Jap Govt place
                                itself in best possible position to counter actual or incipient
                                anti-American sentiment which being systematically provoked on this
                                point by Commies and other elements unfriendly to US.</item>
                            <item>3. Subject is one of provisional nature which will be overtaken by
                                processes of agreement and adjustment; exchange of notes can lapse
                                when agreements have been completed and would not, therefore, be
                                appropriate to main body admin agreement.</item>
                            <item>4. Bulk of facilities and areas should and can be agreed within
                                period indicated; commitment to US should assure Japs that we are
                                talking about exceptional cases and not bulk facilities now held by
                                occupation. Comment: Exchange of notes involves no limitation on
                                numbers of “exceptional cases”. Even Japs like <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> have <pb xml:id="pg_1167" n="1167" facs="0111"/>stated publicly that Japs should expect
                                that US forces will remain in large proportion of facilities now
                                being used. However, “exceptional cases” will undoubtedly prove to
                                be those in controversy, involving conflict of interest between US
                                military requirements and pressures on and by Jap Govt to obtain
                                release. If considerable proportion facilities required by our
                                forces prove to be in this category, we must expect Jap charge not
                                only that we are doing violence to concept of exceptional cases in
                                exchange of notes, but also that we are abusing peace treaty itself.
                                Argument would concern choice urban, industrial and commercial
                                installations on which pressures are likely to be strong. Unless we
                                are prepared to rest our case for continued use of such unagreed
                                facilities on exceptional character and essential need, exchange of
                                notes has in it seeds of future trouble, but I see little prospect
                                that we can improve our position by present unequivocal commitments
                                on face of agreement that leaves matter solely in US hands.</item>
                            <item>5. Exchange of notes will not encounter sustained interest and
                                objection Jap Diet and public opinion as would same commitment in
                                agreement.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>We have tried various drafts Art 2 with Japs to get core this commitment
                            in art itself, including considerable window dressing in effort make
                            more palatable. Japs fully recognize issue is who has decision on
                            continued use facilities not yet agreed and appear determined not give
                            flat commitment to US in agreement though willing do so exchange of
                            notes. Their drafts Art 2 this point continue to insist “consultations
                            for these arrangements shall be completed at the earliest possible date
                            and not in any case later than 90 days after the coming into effect on
                                <hi rend="italic">[of]</hi> this agreement”.</p>
                        <p>Based on experience and impressions this visit I have no misgivings about
                            determination US military authorities here to give urgent attention and
                            make bona fide effort conclude satisfactory arrangements facilities and
                            areas earliest possible date. There is no lack understanding such
                            authorities of political as well as military elements this problem. Jap
                            misgivings are natural until more info is available and in view some
                            cases tactless talk or action by subordinate officials in dealing with
                            local Jap owners or officials. Although subject will be difficult, I see
                            no reason why bulk (numerically) of necessary agreements cannot be
                            reached within 90 days effective date treaty.</p>
                        <p>In view of importance this commitment to us, I recommend that we agree to
                            obtain it in public exchange of notes and not try to insist upon our
                            proposed method.</p>
                        <p>Further, I recommend that if exchange of notes is used, we use draft
                            submitted which contains essential commitment we need in <pb xml:id="pg_1168" n="1168" facs="0112"/>language which Japs will

                            Jap Govt will give them most careful consideration to determine whether
                            there is not basis for agreement new text.</p>
                        <p>As Jap Govt knows, right of US Forces to act in own security is

                        <p>US Govt attaches greatest importance to efforts now being made by free
                            nations to organize for peace: US now has security arrangements with
                            almost 40 nations, of which Jap one of first importance. We can best
                            avoid war by determined expression solidarity, and solidarity is best
                            registered by definite indications that nations are in fact joining to

                            prevent war rather than provide machinery waging war, indication of
                            practical machinery is step toward peace. US Govt also considers

                                point was as follows: “My Government considers the Security Treaty
                                between our two Governments as a provisional measure, pending the

                                in Article IV of the Security Treaty. My Government believes that it
                                would be useful to acknowledge in Article XXII the temporary
                                character of such arrangements pending a broader and more
                                satisfactory disposition by the nations concerned, regarding the

                            suggested that joint committee “study and prepare concrete program” re
                            Art 1 of Security Treaty; US Govt believes new text provides means
                            accomplishing this which are better than joint committee, fully occupied
                            with other matters.</p>
                        <p>Our new draft should help allay any doubts that US considers security Jap

                        <p>With respect to Article II, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that he had sent the new U.S. Delegation

                                1690 from Tokyo, <ref target="#d514">Document 514</ref>.</note>
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that, if the U.S. Government accepts that proposal, Article II
                            would be disposed of.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Article XXII, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated that the Japanese Government had
                            considered the statement of U.S. views and the proposed redraft of
                            Article XXII handed to them on February 16 by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, and that he had certain informal
                            comments to make orally and informally on behalf of his Government with
                            respect to that subject. He then distributed the text of such comments
                            (a copy of which is attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d520fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> which he proceeded to read orally. Following the
                            conclusion of the reading of these comments, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated that he was not entirely
                            satisfied with the language in which they were couched, and that he
                            would therefore be appreciative if the U.S. Delegation would accept
                            those comments as tentative and entirely informal. He went on to say
                            that the Japanese Government is now giving consideration to a formula
                            for Article XXII which might be satisfactory to both parties, which he
                            hoped would be ready on the following day. He reiterated that, although
                            there would appear to be no alternative to a combined command in time of
                            emergency, a public commitment to that effect in the Administrative
                            Agreement would sound the “death kneIl of the Liberal Party. He added
                            that it would also tend to be destructive of the will of the National
                            Police Reserve to fight in defense of their country.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thanked Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> for his presentation,
                            and stated that he desired clarification on one or two points raised by
                            those comments. With reference to the statement contained in the
                            attached presentation to the effect that Japan’s security forces “are
                            not supposed to engage in any belligerent action for protecting the
                            state against threat from outside”, he inquired whether this meant that
                            Japan could not defend itself in the event of unprovoked attack. He also
                            asked how that language could be reconciled with the reference in the
                            Security Treaty to the “inherent right of individual and collective
                            self-defense”, and whether the latter phraseology would not constitute a
                            legal basis for Japanese participation in joint defense measures in the
                            event of such an attack. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> replied that it was mainly by reason of the
                            sentence to which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            referred that he had expressed a reservation as to the language of his
                            Government’s presentation. He stated that Article V of the Peace Treaty
                            is interpreted by his Government to mean that Japan as a sovereign state
                            possesses the right of self-defense, but that a question arises as to
                            how <pb xml:id="pg_1177" n="1177" facs="0121"/>and to what extent the
                            Japanese people desire to implement that right; i.e. through amendment
                            of the Constitution, new legislation, etc. He added that, apart from the
                            sentence quoted by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, he saw no contradiction between the text of the
                            Japanese comments and the principles set forth in the Security Treaty
                            and in Article V of the Peace Treaty. He reiterated that the text of the
                            comments which he had presented should be considered as provisional,
                            inasmuch as they would require revision on certain points. Referring to
                            the constitutional bar against the establishment of Japanese armed
                            forces, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated
                            that some legal theorists in Japan hold that Article IX of the
                            Constitution does not preclude the maintenance of armed forces for
                            self-defense, but that other theorists hold the contrary view.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that the
                            legal advisers on his Delegation had suggested the possible deletion of
                            the Article titles in the final text of the Administrative Agreement,
                            and inquired whether this might not be helpful in the case of Article
                            XXII. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> indicated
                            that it might be. In response to a further question from Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated that he expected to have
                            the views of his Government on Article XXII ready for presentation to
                            the U.S. Delegation by the afternoon of the following day. At this
                            juncture Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said
                            that he would like to put forward on his own responsibility, informally
                            and not for the record, a suggested formula for covering the subject of
                            joint defense measures; he then showed to the members of the U.S.
                            Delegation a redraft of that Article utilizing the formula that “nothing
                            in this Agreement shall preclude” the taking of the necessary measures
                            by the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then inquired
                            whether the principal difficulty for the Japanese Government with
                            respect to ArticIe XXll lies in the mere mention of a “combined
                            command”, or In the retention of language Indicating that the U.S. shall
                            be the one to establish such a command. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> replied that the reservations
                            entertained by the Japanese Government on this Article arise primarily
                            out of concern as to the reaction of the Diet, mainly on the
                            constitutional issue. He emphasized that the Japanese people would
                            willingly accept a U.S. Commander-in-Chief under pressure of an actual
                            emergency situation, but that it is not politically feasible for the
                            Japanese to commit itself to such action in advance of such a
                            contingency. He went on to say that the Japanese people like to think of
                            the eventual possibility of a Japanese Commander-in-Chief heading all
                            security forces in Japan at some later date, and that, although this is
                            recognized as unrealistic in so far as the immediate future is
                            concerned, the door must at least ostensibly be left open to such a
                            possibility. He stated that Article XXII <pb xml:id="pg_1178" n="1178" facs="0122"/>involves a serious political issue which affects the
                            very existence of the Liberal Party and the present Government; he added
                            that the Liberal Party is easily the most reliable political party in
                            Japan and that it would be unwise to weaken it over this issue. He then
                            expressed the view that acceptance of a provision along the lines of the
                            U.S. draft of Article XXII would “certainly” bring about the defeat of
                            the Government party in the next general elections. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then inquired what the attitude of
                            the Democratic Party would be on this point. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> replied that both the Democratic
                            Party and the Green Breeze Society, as well as all other Japanese
                            political parties, would oppose such a provision, even though most of
                            them would recognize the inevitability in practice of acting in
                            accordance therewith in the event of an emergency. He added that the
                            Administrative Agreement cannot be made to work without mutual
                            confidence of the two nations, and that on the Japanese side such
                            confidence could not survive the acceptance of Article XXII in its
                            present form. He reiterated that the present Japanese Government,
                            including the Prime Minister, admits the necessity at this stage of a
                            U.S. Commander-in-Chief in the event of emergency, but that it cannot
                            make a public commitment to that effect.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Johnson</persName>
                            inquired of Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> as to
                            whether the Japanese Government would object to the inclusion in Article
                            XXII of a reference to Article IV of the Security Treaty. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> replied that he would
                            have to see the language in which such reference might be couched, but
                            that they had already agreed to a reference to Article I of the Security
                            Treaty and that in principle he saw no reason why mention could not also
                            be made of Article IV.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> then reiterated
                            with considerable emphasis that, whatever may be the substance of
                            Article XXII, it will be virtually impossible for the Japanese
                            Government to agree to any mention therein of a “combined command” or
                            “combined commander”. He stated that the Diet is already attacking the
                            expansion of the National Police Reserve, at least in part because of a
                            suspicion that Japanese land forces are being built up for the purpose
                            of being sacrificed as cannon-fodder under a U.S. Commander-in-Chief and
                            in the service of U.S. objectives. He said that, under such
                            circumstances, the very mention of a U.S. Commander-in-Chief is
                            politically bad. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>
                            then asked Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Johnson</persName> if the Defense Department is very insistent on
                            the maintenance of its position on Article XXII. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Johnson</persName> replied that he was confident
                            that such is in fact the case, and that he would not undertake to say
                            that they could be dissuaded from that position.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1179" n="1179" facs="0123"/>
                        <p>In reply to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Johnson</persName>, Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated that, although he would not like to be so
                            quoted, the Japanese Government is thinking in terms of the eventual
                            amendment of Article IX of the Constitution, but only after the
                            Government has won the forthcoming general elections and has had an
                            opportunity to prepare the way with Japanese public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked whether,
                            in the revision of the Japanese Government’s position on this subject,
                            mention of a joint command could be included among the measures of
                            Japanese cooperation in the field of defense. He pointed out that
                            demonstration of free world solidarity in the face of threatened
                            aggression is an important deterrent and one which should be reflected
                            in the relationship between the U.S. and Japan, just as it is in the
                            relationships between the U.S. and the countries of Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated that his
                            Government would try to meet the point of view expressed by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to the maximum extent, as
                            it is also anxious to conclude the Administrative Agreement at the
                            earliest possible time. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that, in view of their tentative nature, he
                            would not report to Washington the views of the Japanese Government on
                            this subject as set forth in Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>’s presentation, pending the receipt of their
                            further comments as promised by Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> agreed that what he had said should be
                            off-the-record for the time being, adding that, in view of the vital
                            importance of this subject, extensive consultation would be necessary
                            within the Japanese Government in the formulation of a position.</p>

                            played no direct part in the earlier negotiations, might find it
                            convenient to have this summary by him. At a later stage, when it was
                            possible to look more closely at the details of the document, we found
                            it contained statements which, in varying degrees, differed from the
                            Foreign Office record and omitted or touched lightly on considerations
                            which had, in fact, loomed large in the formulation of the attitude of

                            because policy towards China remains the subject of acute public

                            wise to place on record the fact that our absence of comment on the
                            memorandum does not imply that it corresponds in every respect with our

                                    was then considered. (With reference to the inclusion in that
                                    redraft of the term “combined command”, which he had previously
                                    indicated would not be acceptable to the Prime Minister,

                                    managed to persuade the Prime Minister to agree to that phrase.)
                                    After considerable discussion, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> handed to Minister

                                    expressed the personal opinion that the revised text would be

                        <p>4. Our second draft Art 22 contains no important agreement or commitment
                            going beyond above text.</p>
                        <p>5. Right of US forces to act in own security in emergency is nailed down;
                            such action must be immediately followed by, but is not conditional upon
                            info to Jap Govt, whose vital interest it is impossible to deny.</p>
                        <p>6. I do not believe we can get more unless we are prepared use threats
                            and pressures which, if backed up, would be disastrous US-Jap relations.
                            If we have more specific arrangements in mind, above text leaves way
                            open for consultation about them; in any event our earlier text did not
                            provide any agreement now as to more specific arrangements.</p>
                        <p>7. Alternatives before us are, broadly,</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) Accept text given above;</item>
                            <item>(b) Delete Art 22 and discuss entire matter later;</item>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_1183" n="1183" facs="0127"/>
                            <item>(c) Use only short general sentence, then consult later;</item>
                            <item>(d) Prolong negotiations here to try obtain difference between
                                above text and our second draft.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>8. Among alternatives, any of first three can be accomplished. First
                            alternative will produce considerable amount acrimonious debate and will
                            increase pressures to obtain restrictions on broad rights under Security
                            Treaty. Second alternative might have been wise originally, as leaving
                            us maximum freedom of action, but it is now known subject has been at
                            issue in negotiations and complete silence might now excite suspicions.
                            Third alternative would be to use some such sentence as “in the event of
                            hostilities, or imminently threatened hostilities, in the Japan area,
                            the Governments of the United States and Japan shall immediately consult
                            together with a view to taking necessary joint measures for the defense
                            of that area and to carry out the purposes of Art 1 of the Security
                            Treaty”.</p>
                        <p>This alternative would not cloud our rights under Security Treaty, would
                            involve minimum domestic debate Japan and would not raise constitutional
                            issues. Fourth alternative is no choice at all, because it would be
                            fruitless and would produce highly dangerous build-up of anti-American
                            feeling here, even among groups ordinarily friendly to US.</p>
                        <p>9. My recommendation is that we promptly accept first alternative if our
                            policy is to get as much of our draft as we can. In this case, no
                            significant changes of language should be attempted. My own personal
                            judgment is that our interests are best served by third alternative. I
                            strongly recommend against fourth alternative. Info copy furnished

                            of the exchange of notes, in an endeavor to reconcile the respective

                            course of such explanation, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that the changes suggested by
                            Washington were primarily motivated by a strong desire for more specific
                            assurances regarding the right of U.S. security forces to remain in such
                            facilities as might not be agreed upon during the 90–day period.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then stated that,
                            before hearing the views of the Japanese Delegation on the suggested
                            revision of the exchange of notes under Article II, he wished to go on
                            and cover the remainder of his new instructions by explaining
                            Washington’s latest point of view regarding Article XXII. He stated that
                            the views of the Japanese Government regarding the problem presented by
                            the language of Article XXII, particularly that concerning a “combined
                            command”, had, led to a complete re-examination of the problem in
                            Washington, in the light of the political problems which might be
                            created for the Prime Minister and the Japanese Government by that
                            Article. He went on to say that there was a strong disinclination in
                            Washington to do anything which would add unnecessarily to the difficult
                            probIems which would confront the Japanese Government during the
                            forthcoming important period of transition from occupation to full
                            sovereignty, and that it had accordingly been decided recede from the
                            previous U.S. position on Article XXII and to accept in its stead a
                            broad general statement along the Japanese Government. He stated that he
                            wished to make it clear, however, that this did not mean that the U.S.
                            Government had changed its desiderata with respect to Article XXXII. nor
                            did it mean that the U.S. Government will not want to discuss at a later
                            date the subject matter formerly dealt with in Article XXII. He
                            reiterated that, on the contrary, this change was indicative merely of
                            recognition on the part of the U.S. Government of the political
                            difficulties which might be created for the Japanese Government by the
                            language which we had previously proposed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then handed Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> the text of his Government’s

                            as representing the firm position of his Government. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that it was the
                            wish of his Delegation to omit any mention of Articles II and XXII from
                            the Official Minutes,<note n="4" xml:id="d528fn4">Not found in
                                Department of State files.</note> and to have everything having to
                            do with those Articles included in the text of the Administrative
                            Agreement, and, in the case of Article II, in the accompanying exchange
                            of notes. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated
                            that his Delegation was in agreement on that point.</p>
                        <p>Turning again to Article XXII, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that, despite the most recent change in the
                            position of his Government on this Article, we were nonetheless grateful
                            for the strenuous efforts of the Prime Minister and Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> to meet our views on this
                            Article. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> then
                            gave assurance that the deletion of the phrase “combined command” from
                            Article XXII will not be interpreted by the Japanese Government to mean
                            that we are no longer interested in the establishment of such a command.
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Johnson</persName>
                            stated that Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and
                            the Prime Minister might be interested to know that General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> had been of considerable help
                            on Article XXII. Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>
                            stated that he would convey that information to the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> concluded by
                            saying that the change in the U.S. position on Article XXII would
                            “greatly strengthen” the position of the Japanese Government in dealing
                            with opposition to the security arrangements between the U.S. and
                            Japan.</p>

                        <p>Pls note that above language takes into account that it is continued use
                            of facilities and areas on which agreements and arrangements have not
                            been completed by expiration 90 days after date of Jap treaty instead of
                            facilities now in use. Many of facilities “now” in use will have been
                            agreed upon and many others will have been returned to Japan. Jap
                            commitment, therefore, is on those facilities and areas on which there
                            would be any problem.</p>
                        <p>Note also use of words “will grant”. We believe that confirmation now
                            that the Jap Govt will grant continued use of the facilities and areas
                            referred to is as binding and satisfactory a commitment as we would have
                            if present tense “grants” were used. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said since entire situation was one cast in
                            future tense, it would look <pb xml:id="pg_1192" n="1192" facs="0136"/>“most peculiar” to use present tense on this word. He strongly
                            insisted that commitment Jap Govt is same in both instances.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> expressed deep gratitude
                            for understanding US Govt regarding art 22 and said that our generalized
                            language would greatly strengthen Jap Govt in supporting admin
                            agreement. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and I agreed

                            expenses. Biggest problem arose from fact that, in computing $155
                            million Jap contribution, basic data and figures were those taken from
                            TOW procedures and included Jap taxes. In approving this amount Jap
                            budget, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> authorities had before
                            them breakdown of figures showing tax element approximately 900 million
                            yen. Same amount showed up on revenue side Jap budget. Budget was
                            approved and submitted Diet this basis and commitment made that this
                            amount was all Jap would be asked to contribute first year under admin
                            agreement. When we raised question tax exemption, Japs had to insist
                            that we either pay taxes of amount included, or reduce total by same
                            amount. Alternative would be effort change budget in difficult stage
                            budget action by Diet. Japs also felt our <pb xml:id="pg_1193" n="1193" facs="0137"/>raising this question was contrary assurances re size
                            of contribution.</p>
                        <p>This problem exists only for first year, but is one on which US was
                            committed. Minutes will try to straighten out tangle thereby created.
                            Our solution is that during period when Japs are making disbursements,
                            pending legislative authority for US Forces to do so, Japs will pay
                            bills including tax element as with TOW. After we make disbursement
                            direct, Japs would remit to us their contribution less tax element and
                            we would procure with same exemptions as with other funds. Net result is
                            that contribution first year is about $2½ million less than we thought
                            in Wash, but is same as agreed in Tokyo between us and Jap budget
                            people.</p>

                                understanding that the yen fund provided in para 2 (b) shall be
                                transferred to a US special account by the Jap Govt on a quarterly
                                basis. The obligation program shall also be on a quarterly basis and
                                shall be prepared in concert with the Jap Govt. With respect to
                                receipts, obligations and cash payments of the special account,
                                monthly reports (including reports for shorter periods, if
                                necessary) shall be promptly transmitted to the Jap Govt to
                                facilitate necessary adjustments on subsequent transfers.
                                Disbursements from this account shall meet standard requirements as
                                agreed by both parties along the line of standards required by the
                                General Accounting Office, US Govt, with due consideration given to
                                the standard practices in Japan, and Jap members of the Joint
                                Committee may audit the special account with the assistance of
                                government experts and with the cooperation of US
                                authorities.</item>
                            <item>“(By <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>): I understand
                                that disbursement of this fund will be made by the US. However,
                                enabling legislation will be required of the US Congress before such
                                disbursement procedure can be placed in effect. As an interim
                                measure, I understand that disbursement of these funds shall be made
                                by Jap disbursing officers but that such disbursements will be made
                                under the programming procedures which you have described.</item>
                            <item>“(By <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>): I agree.
                                Inasmuch as payment of taxes is the normal established practice of
                                the Jap Govt, the Jap currency referred to in para 2 (b) provided by
                                means of a Jap Govt appropriation includes an element for payment of
                                taxes. It is therefore understood that the 1952–53 appropriation for
                                defense expenses includes taxes.</item>
                            <item>“(By <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>): I understand
                                that as a budgetary practice your defense appropriations may include
                                an element for taxes. However, as a principle governing
                                international relations it is basically inappropriate for one govt
                                to pay taxes to another govt in matters pertaining to joint and
                                mutual defense efforts. Therefore, I believe that such funds
                                appropriated by the Jap Govt should not be depleted by the payment
                                of direct taxes, since such depletion would require an increase in
                                the contribution of the US to offset such payments without adding to
                                the joint and mutual defense effort. It is recognized, however, that
                                the computation for the Jap contribution <pb xml:id="pg_1194" n="1194" facs="0138"/>for 1952–53 did include a tax element and
                                therefore should include the payment of taxes. In succeeding years
                                it is agreed that both parties will adhere to the general principle
                                of relief from taxation and future estimates will be so computed.
                                Such funds as are turned over to the US from the Jap appropriation
                                for 1952–53 disbursement by the US shall be reduced by the amount of
                                the agreed tax element”.</item>

                            provisions on taxation, safety measures for garrison force, procurement

                            bitter. Progressive reform chief Nomiki characterized adoption
                            “nationality principle” criminal jurisdiction as “subservient and
                            disgraceful”. Upper House <gloss target="#t_Ryokufukai1">Ryokufukai</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d531fn2">The Green Breeze

                            whole, expressed dissatisfaction with “nationality principle” contending
                            nationality principle more appropriate for “sovereign nations on equal
                            footing.” Both right and left wing Socialists, as expected, expressed
                            opposition. Mizutani of right wing policy council said principle “places
                            serious restriction on our sovereignty.” Left-winger <pb xml:id="pg_1195" n="1195" facs="0139"/>Wada said “this not agreement
                            between two nations on equal basis. Will establish military bases
                            everywhere in country and place nearly half public facilities under
                            military custody.” Later in day opposition parties issued fol statement:
                            “Govt and its party are secretly concluding agreement that restricts
                            sovereignty of state and basic human rights of people. Moreover, they
                            have used majority power force through budget bill which inseparably
                            related to administrative agreement. This is dictatorial politics,
                            ignoring Diet’s right of deliberation.”</p>
                        <p>Although text of agreement will not be released until tomorrow, editorial
                            comment today on basis substantial leak yesterday almost universally
                            adverse, suggesting press ready criticize for criticism’s sake. Most
                            criticism directed at criminal jurisdiction which some felt tantamount
                            to extrality. Also, general feeling disappointment administrative
                            agreement not brought before Diet for approval.</p>

                            reflects wishes and trends national sentiment.” Again “we can understand
                            that US does not like see drastic change from status of occupation force
                            but from Japanese standpoint only through such change can Japanese
                            people finally feel they are independent sovereign Japan.” Same daily
                            regretted agreement did not clarify such points as use US troops in time
                            emergency, facilities and areas and compensation damages caused by US
                            soldiers on duty. Suggested effort be made revise agreement after it is
                            signed, ending on plea that agreement not be allowed damage relations
                            between two countries, saying, “what is important is that contents of

                            reconciliation and mutual trust that underlies peace treaty and security

                        <p>Some of frankest criticism came from <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi> which
                            said “there is not a clause in agreement that reminds us of appearance
                            of independent Japan. We recognize no evidence of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> govt, which is highhanded in
                            domestic administration but conciliatory in foreign relations, having
                            tried protect our line of autonomy and independence. In response public
                            opinion, some consideration apparently given to matter court

                            Negotiation of Administrative Agreement</p>
                        <p>The following summarizes, by Articles, the disposition of proposals made
                            by the Japanese Government for changes in the draft administrative
                            agreement which was submitted to them in behalf of the U.S. Delegation
                            about January 23, 1952,<note n="2" xml:id="d533fn2">See <ref target="#d481fn3">footnote 3, Document 481</ref>.</note> a few
                            days before the U.S. Delegation arrived in Tokyo for the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Numbers of Articles are those of text of final agreement. Where the
                            numbers of Washington draft differ, they are shown in parentheses.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article I</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government took the position that the “civilian component”
                            should be defined as in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and
                            consequently should not include:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) nationals of third states or stateless persons</item>
                            <item>(b) persons serving with or accompanying the US armed
                                forces</item>
                            <item>(c) contractors with the US armed forces</item>
                            <item>(d) employees of contractors with the US armed forces</item>
                            <item>(e) persons under contract with contractors with the US armed
                                forces.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Japanese ultimately conceded that the civilian component should be
                            defined to include category (b), and that categories (c) and (d) should
                            be given substantially the same privileges as other members of the
                            civilian component, although these privileges were to be conferred upon
                            them in a separate article, rather than by including them within the
                            term “civilian component”. We agreed to exclude categories (a) and (e)
                            from the definition of “civilian component”.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article II</p>
                        <p>The Japanese insisted at the start of the negotiations that the third
                            sentence of paragraph 1, which authorized the US to continue to use
                            facilities presently in use until arrangements for other facilities <pb xml:id="pg_1198" n="1198" facs="0142"/>could be made through the
                            Joint Committee, should be deleted. They contended that such an
                            authorization amounted to a continuation of procurement demand after the
                            occupation had ended. They were willing, however, to include the
                            substance of the third sentence in an exchange of notes to be signed
                            simultaneously with the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Both sides prepared drafts of the exchange of notes in which Japan would
                            authorize our forces to continue to use facilities and areas now in use,
                            in cases where agreement on the use of facilities and areas had not been
                            reached within 90 days after the effective date of the peace treaty.
                            Difficulty arose over the effort of the Japanese to include in the notes
                            a statement by us either that we had no doubt agreement on facilities
                            and areas could be reached within the 90–day period, or that every
                            effort would be made to complete agreement within that period. We, on
                            the other hand, sought to include a statement by the Japanese
                            recognizing that delays might arise in reaching and giving effect to
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The outcome was an exchange of notes in which we agreed to begin
                            consultation on facilities and areas immediately, and on an urgent
                            basis, in order to complete such arrangements at the earliest possible
                            date. The Japanese, on the other hand recognized that “unavoidable
                            delays [“?] may arise in the determination and preparation of facilities
                            and areas and agreed to grant to the US the continual use of particular
                            facilities and areas on which agreements had not been reached within 90
                            days after the effective date of the peace treaty.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article III</p>
                        <p>The Japanese proposed, and we agreed, to provide for consultation between
                            the two governments concerning the exercise outside the facilities and
                            areas of the rights, power, and authority granted in this article. The
                            Japanese asked that paragraph two, the itemization of rights of the US,
                            be deleted from the Agreement, but later agreed to include the text of
                            the paragraph in the official Minutes of the negotiations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article IV</p>
                        <p>The Japanese proposed, and we agreed, to revise the language of paragraph
                            one to provide that the offsetting of US and Japanese claims arising out
                            of changes in condition of facilities and areas would apply to all
                            facilities and areas at the time of their becoming available to the US
                            forces instead of at the time of the coming into force of the Agreement.
                            We proposed, and the Japanese agreed, to add to paragraph one a phrase
                            making clear that the US had no obligation to compensate for changes in
                            facilities and areas.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1199" n="1199" facs="0143"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article V</p>
                        <p>In compliance with a Japanese request we agreed to put into the Minutes
                            concerning this article a statement specifying (1) that commercial
                            vessels should not be treated in the same way as US public vessels under
                            this Article unless they were on bareboat, voyage or time charter to the
                            US; and (2) that commercial cargo and private passengers were carried by
                            such vessels only in exceptional cases. We agreed to insert in the text
                            of the article an undertaking to notify the appropriate Japanese
                            authorities in the event any commercial cargo or passengers were carried
                            on such vessels or aircraft. Upon Japanese agreement to grant freedom of
                            access and movement to US forces between facilities and areas and
                            between such facilities and areas and ports, we did not insist upon
                            freedom of movement by land between ports of Japan.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article VI</p>
                        <p>No Japanese proposal was made on this article.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article VII</p>
                        <p>The Japanese objected to the provision that rates paid by the US armed
                            forces for public utilities and services should be no less favorable
                            than those applicable “to any department or agency of the Government of
                            Japan” because, for historic reasons, the Japanese police are granted a
                            very substantial discount on telecommunications rates. We agreed to
                            change the ending of the article in order to prescribe that rates should
                            be no less favorable than those applicable to “the ministries and
                            agencies of the Government of Japan”. A statement was put into the
                            Minutes that for the time being we would not ask for the special police
                            discount, but we did not consider that the US should pay for any
                            significant period rates higher than those paid by the <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article VIII</p>
                        <p>The Japanese objected to the provision that all of the meteorological
                            services which they were obliged to furnish should be furnished without
                            expense to the US. They insisted that the expense for such services
                            should be handled in the same way as the expense for all other services
                            under the provisions of Article XIII. We agreed to delete from the
                            article the phrase “without expense to the US” upon the Japanese
                            agreeing to insert in the Minutes a statement that the charges for these
                            services would be limited to such expense as was incurred by the
                            Japanese solely for purposes of furnishing information to the US armed
                            forces, and excluding any expense which the Japanese incurred in order
                            to furnish services to the Japanese public or to the international
                            community. We agreed to itemize in the Article the services to be
                            furnished, since <pb xml:id="pg_1200" n="1200" facs="0144"/>the
                            itemization merely expressed in detail what was already included in the
                            general language of our original draft.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article IX</p>
                        <p>No proposals were made on this article.</p>

                        <p>This is a new article proposed by the Japanese. We agreed to it with
                            slight modifications.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XI (Washington Article X)</p>
                        <p>The Japanese first wanted to deny any exemptions from import duties to
                            contractors. They then offered to grant exemptions only to contractors
                            who were brought to Japan from the United States, and who were not
                            ordinarily resident in Japan. They also made several proposals about
                            certifications to be furnished in cases of imports by contractors. They
                            finally agreed, in effect, to permit contractors to import duty free
                            materials, supplies and equipment to be used exclusively by the US armed
                            forces or ultimately to be incorporated into articles or facilities used
                            by such forces, provided that the US take delivery and certify that such
                            goods were to be used for the purposes specified.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese were unwilling to give an exemption to members of the US
                            armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents in the terms
                            of our draft which exempted from import duty all property consigned to
                            or for the personal use of such persons. We accepted their statement of
                            the exemption to be accorded to such persons which is much more detailed
                            than ours, but which still permits exemption from duty of all goods
                            imported in reasonable quantities for personal use, provided that such
                            goods are brought in by such persons at the time of their entry into
                            Japan or are mailed into Japan through US military post offices. We
                            agreed that such persons are not permitted to import goods free of duty
                            other than at time of entrance or through the mails, except “vehicles
                            and parts” which may be imported for private use free of duty at any
                            time.</p>
                        <p>We agreed to insert in the Article the provision that the granting of
                            exemptions from import duties did not oblige the Japanese to grant
                            refunds of customs duties and domestic excises which had already been
                            collected. The Japanese offered to exempt from customs examination units
                            and members of the US armed forces under orders entering or leaving
                            Japan. We accepted about two-thirds of the Japanese proposals aimed at
                            providing safeguards against abuse of the privileges granted in the
                            Article.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XII (Washington Article XI)</p>
                        <p>Both sides worked toward expanding this Article to specify the taxes on
                            goods procured by the US armed forces from which they would be entitled
                            to claim exemption. Provision was made for exemptions from or refunds of
                            any present or future Japanese taxes which might be found to constitute
                            a significant and readily identifiable part of the gross purchase
                            price.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese were at first unwilling to grant any tax exemption to
                            contractors procuring goods for ultimate use by our forces. They later
                            offered to insert in the Minutes a statement prescribing procedures for
                            such exemptions. They finally agreed to include in the article a
                            provision recognizing that procurement for ultimate use by our forces
                            should be exempt from tax, and to insert in the Minutes a statement
                            prescribing procedures for obtaining such exemptions.</p>
                        <p>At Japanese request the provision concerning conditions of employment of
                            Japanese labor was expanded to specify that rights of such workers
                            should be those prescribed by Japanese law. There was also included in
                            the article a prohibition against disposal to unauthorized persons of
                            goods purchased tax-free.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XIII (Washington Article XII)</p>
                        <p>Both sides agreed that exemption from income tax should not be granted to
                            persons who, for US income tax purposes, claimed to be residents of
                            Japan. At first, the Japanese were unwilling to grant an exemption from
                            income taxation to contractors ordinarily resident in the United States
                            or to employees of such contractors. They later stated they were willing
                            to reduce their income taxes on such income to amounts which did not
                            exceed the taxes such persons would have to pay under US income tax
                            laws. In the end they agreed to grant income tax exemption to such
                            persons, but the provision conferring such exemption was inserted in a
                            new Article XIV.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese were unwilling to exempt from taxation in Japan holdings by
                            members of the US armed forces, etc., of intangible property registered
                            in Japan, or to grant exemption from automobile taxes. We agreed to the
                            Japanese position but insisted that the exemption on automobile taxes be
                            limited to “taxes payable in respect to the use of roads by private
                            vehicles”.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XIV</p>
                        <p>This is a new Article, proposed by the Japanese to cover contractors and
                            their employees. When they first proposed the Article, the Japanese
                            attempted to deny such persons several of the privileges granted to the
                            civilian component. As finally agreed, however, the <pb xml:id="pg_1202" n="1202" facs="0146"/>Article provides that contractors shall be
                            treated in the same way as members of the civilian component except with
                            respect to criminal jurisdiction. It was agreed that the Japanese should
                            have the primary right to exercise criminal jurisdiction over such
                            persons. If they chose not to exercise this right, the US military
                            authorities would then have the right to exercise jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese proposed that US army newspapers which were circulated to
                            the general public should not be exempted from Japanese regulations,
                            etc. We agreed that such newspapers sold to the public should be subject
                            to Japanese regulations, etc., to the extent of such circulation. We
                            agreed to a Japanese request that <gloss target="#t_PX1">PX</gloss>s
                            etc., should be required to comply with Japanese law with respect to the
                            employment of Japanese labor. The provision on this subject is identical
                            with a corresponding provision in Article XII concerning employment by
                            the US armed forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XVI (Washington No. XIV)</p>

                        <p>The Japanese requested that the Agreement authorize Japanese courts and
                            authorities to exercise jurisdiction over offenses committed outside the
                            facilities and areas by members of the US armed forces, etc., where the
                            offending party is a Japanese national. We refused to agree, and the
                            Japanese ultimately accepted a provision stating that the US would give
                            sympathetic consideration to a request by Japan for waiver by the US of
                            its right to exercise jurisdiction in such cases where Japan considered
                            such waiver to be of particular importance.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese sought to deny US military authorities the right to exercise
                            exclusive jurisdiction over (a) contractors, (b) employees of
                            contractors, (c) persons of only Japanese nationality who were
                            dependents of members of our forces or of the civilian component. It was
                            agreed that Japan and the US should exercise concurrent jurisdiction
                            with Japan over these categories (a) and (b) with Japan to have the
                            primary right to exercise jurisdiction. We relinquished any claim to
                            exercise jurisdiction over category (c).</p>
                        <p>The Japanese proposed, and with modifications we agreed to a number of
                            additions to clarify the language of the Article and to prevent
                            criminals from escaping the jurisdiction or enforcement procedures of
                            either the Japanese or US Government.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XVIII (Washington No. XVI)</p>
                        <p>The Japanese first proposed that the cost of settling claims arising out
                            of acts of members and employees of the United States armed forces in
                            the performance of official duty be divided on a 7525, rather than a
                            50–50 basis. They later agreed that the entire cost of settling claims
                            should be lumped with other expenses of maintaining United States armed
                            forces in Japan and, pursuant to Article XXIII, either paid out of the
                            Japanese contribution of $155 million or borne by the United States. We
                            refused to agree to lump costs of settling claims with other expenses
                            incurred under the agreement since the Japanese contribution of $155
                            million had been determined on the assumption it would not include costs
                            of settling claims, and since the United States would not be willing to
                            bear the entire cost of settling claims the amount of which had been
                            determined by the Japanese Government. The ultimate decision was to
                            treat costs of settling claims separately from other expenses and to
                            leave terms of sharing of costs to be determined by future agreement
                            between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese also proposed that Article XVI be expanded to provide
                            procedures for <hi rend="italic">ex gratia</hi> payments of claims
                            arising out of acts of members of the United States armed forces, the
                            civilian component, and their dependents not in the performance of
                            official duty. The procedures proposed were the same as those provided
                            in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement. We accepted the
                            Japanese proposal with the modification that it apply only to claims
                            arising out of the acts of members of, and employees of the United
                            States armed forces.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese objected to the provision that the United States would have
                            the exclusive right to determine whether members or employees had acted
                            in the performance of official duty. They suggested that an arbitrator
                            be appointed, or that the determination be referred to the Joint
                            Committee. They ultimately accepted our proposal which recognized that
                            the United States had the primary right to decide such a question, and
                            that disputes could be referred to the Joint Committee for
                            “consultation.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XIX (Washington No. XVII)</p>
                        <p>The Japanese proposed a slight change in the phrasing of this Article

                        <p>The Japanese asked that there be inserted in the paragraph authorizing

                            provision requiring such banks to maintain such facilities physically
                            separate from their Japanese commercial banking business and subject to
                            “over-all supervision” by the Japanese <pb xml:id="pg_1204" n="1204" facs="0148"/>Ministry of Finance. They ultimately abandoned their
                            proposal concerning supervision on our agreeing to insert in the Minutes
                            that monthly reports of the total MPC-yen conversions be supplied to the
                            Japanese Government. We agreed to certain additional language to state
                            affirmatively that we would take steps to prevent unauthorized use of
                            military payment certificates.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese were unwilling in this Agreement to grant to “other officers
                            and employees of the US Government” the right to use US military post
                            offices. We agreed to delete the quoted phrase with the understanding
                            that the official Minutes would show the Japanese Government intended to
                            grant such privileges to the designated persons.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese proposed a slight change in the language of the Article,

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XXIV (Washington No. XXII)</p>
                        <p>The Japanese made their strongest argument against this article. They
                            first asked that it be deleted entirely. They argued that there should
                            be consultation between the two Governments before we took action even
                            to defend our own forces in Japan. They believed the Diet would consider
                            that the commitments in our Article XXII went beyond Article III of the
                            Security Treaty since latter refers only to “disposition of US forces in
                            and about Japan”. The Diet might, as a consequence, insist on
                            legislative review of the entire agreement. The Article raised questions
                            of highest political and security importance which could not be dealt
                            with in the administrative agreement. In reply we argued that we must
                            have assurance that our forces would be free to defend themselves in an
                            emergency, and that arrangements for action in the event of hostilities
                            or the threat of hostilities were “conditions which shall govern the
                            disposition” of our forces within the meaning of Article III of the
                            Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>It was ultimately recognized that so many controversial issues were
                            raised by the language of this Article that it would be preferable for
                            the Article to state simply that the two Governments would consult on
                            mutual defense measures.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Article XXV (Washington No. XXIII)</p>
                        <p>The Japanese raised a number of questions concerning the meaning of such
                            phrases in our draft as “relative contributions”, “total <pb xml:id="pg_1205" n="1205" facs="0149"/>resources”, and “any
                            comparable arrangements for collective security”. They also questioned
                            references in the article to dividing “local costs” on a basis of
                            parity. We were unable to give a satisfactory definition of local costs.
                            Since they had no objection to the substance of the article (the
                            obligation to furnish real estate rent free and to turn over $155
                            million), it was agreed that non-essential language be eliminated from
                            the Article.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese contended that their contribution of $155 million should be
                            reduced because in computing that amount, the United States had assumed
                            taxes would be paid on procurement in Japan and now the Japanese had
                            agreed to exempt such procurement from taxation. They claimed that, in
                            submitting their budget to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> for
                            approval, and subsequently to the Diet, they had included in their
                            estimates of revenue, a return of approximately 900 million yen in taxes
                            out of their 65 billion expenditure for expenses of United States
                            troops. We recognized that taxes had been included in fixing the
                            Japanese share, and agreed to insert in the Minutes a statement that the
                            tax element of the Japanese contribution for 1952–53 be deducted when
                            payments were made by the Japanese. In subsequent years contributions
                            were to be based on the assumption of tax-free purchasing by our
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese at first contemplated expenditure by themselves of their
                            monetary contribution. They ultimately agreed to turn their contribution
                            over to the US.</p>

                        <p>We agreed to the Japanese proposal to delete the word, “senior”. We

                            for the two Governments each to appoint two representatives, since the
                            Security Treaty has two roles to play, military and political.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese proposed an additional sentence concerning the effective

                            legislation. We changed the wording of the sentence to avoid any
                            implication that the Diet could veto provisions of the Agreement. As

Discussion with Senators <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> indicates growing reluctance several Senators
                            act on Jap Treaty while Taipei negots in what appears critical state and
                            while certain elements spread suspicion Jap Govt not negotiating in good
                            faith, but would seek pretext to break negots as soon as US Senate
                            acted. Don’t believe this reflects majority Senate opinion but in view
                            of almost unlimited possibilities of delay which Senate procedure
                            affords even small minority, suggest that, at your discretion, you bring
                            situation to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s attn in the

                            Having gone so far, and we believe rightly so, to win US Congressional
                            goodwill, don’t believe result should be prejudiced by technicalities on
                            matters of substance. We on our side, will be prepared, if appropriate
                            occasion arises, to use good offices to urge Chi not make unreasonable

                                    Arizona on Monday. He believes it was a wise thing to put the
                                    Japanese Treaty ahead of the Tidelands bill and believes that
                                    that could and should be done. He thought that they had to

                            item secret.) The Administrative Agreement was signed on February 28,
                            1952, at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs by <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JED1">Earl D. Johnson</persName> for the United States
                            and <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Katsuo Okazaki</persName> for Japan. The
                            text was released to the press the same day.</p>
                        <p>The last week of the negotiations was concerned mainly with (1) revising
                            the provision regarding defense measures, a “generalized” version
                            prepared by the United States which proved highly acceptable to the
                            Japanese, (2) amending the wording regarding continued use of facilities
                            and areas by the United States forces and agreeing to an exchange of
                            notes on this matter, and (3) resolving certain questions regarding
                            taxation to be made by Japan on its contribution of $155,000,000 for the
                            maintenance of the United States forces, where it was agreed that since
                            Japan had already drawn up its budget for the fiscal year 1952–1953 on
                            the basis that this sum could be subject to taxation, there would be no
                            objection this year but in succeeding years it would not be appropriate
                            that Japan diminish its contribution through taxes.</p>
                        <p>The Agreement was signed in an atmosphere of great public interest and
                            apprehension, which was reflected at the signing ceremony by a flood of
                            klieg lights and clicking cameras and batteries of microphones. The
                            Budget Committee of the House of Representatives had for several weeks
                            been wrestling with the budget, and Opposition politicians had used this
                            opportunity to grill Government leaders on all aspects of the Agreement,
                            including rearmament, despatch abroad of the National Police Reserve,
                            jurisdiction, taxation, and even expenses. A series of robberies,
                            generally reported as involving foreigners in United States army
                            uniforms, had sustained the attention aroused by the Senju bank holdup
                            of February <pb xml:id="pg_1208" n="1208" facs="0152"/>18, and pointed
                            up the significance of the criminal jurisdiction provisions of the
                            anticipated Agreement.</p>
                        <p>On February 26, a new high in public interest was reached when <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Yomiuri</hi>
                            published detailed summaries of the Agreement, probably based on
                            information received from the Finance Ministry, which contained accurate
                            outlines of a number of clauses regarding expenses, taxation, and
                            procurement, but was generally vague or inaccurate on other major items
                            such as facilities and areas, jurisdiction, and defense measures. These
                            articles served, however, to provoke bitter attacks in the Diet and
                            press, and charges of extraterritoriality swelled. The Opposition issued
                            a statement condemning the Government’s conduct of the negotiations and
                            in the Budget Committee proposed a vote of no-confidence in State
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> on the ground
                            that he had failed to report adequately the contents of the Agreement to
                            the Diet. Various lawyers and commentators argued that the criminal
                            jurisdiction provisions, as reported in the press, would constitute a
                            violation of Japan’s sovereignty and thereby continued to concentrate
                            public interest on the issue of extraterritoriality.</p>
                        <p>Publication of the text of the Agreement and press conference by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> did not appear substantially to
                            reduce criticism of the Agreement, even though there seemed to be at
                            least temporarily a lessening of public apprehension as efforts were
                            made to understand its terms. Opposition leaders continued to attack the
                            Government and announced their plan to hold a public rally in protest on
                            March 6. The press generally took the view that the Agreement was not
                            concluded on an equal basis and that it failed to answer important
                            questions regarding criminal jurisdiction and emergency defense
                            measures. There was also some concern over hitherto neglected technical
                            issues, such as use of military currency and dollar checks by the United
                            States forces, the free entry of United States vessels, planes, and
                            personnel, and the right to equal use of Japanese public utilities.</p>
                        <p>It is still too early to assess Japanese reaction in proper perspective,
                            but the mood of concern tinged with bitterness would appear to presage a
                            period of difficulty in United States–Japan relations. (RBF)<note n="2" xml:id="d535fn2">

                                total orders which it has been able to place to date for support of

                                combat end items. Accordingly, in order to reduce costs of
                                manufacturing, to strengthen the industrial mobilization base in
                                Japan, and to improve Japan’s capabilities to provide for her own

                            that the foregoing proviso creates no effective obstacle to the

                            possible create healthy atmosphere. He asked me assure you there was no

                            reiterated that Chinese are skillful negotiators who place great
                            emphasis upon language employed. When I remarked there are rumors Jap

                                    <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> stated that Yen’s
                                first point was that while the Chinese Government did not expect
                                specific recognition in the bilateral treaty of its position as one
                                of the victorious allies, or of its sovereignty over the mainland,
                                it was not willing to sign a treaty which failed to imply the
                                former, or which would give up the latter. (693.941/3–552)</note> He

                            <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Generalissimo</persName> thinks Japs will
                            make grave error if they fail embrace this opportunity for
                            reconciliation with Chi Govt. He regards tenor of Jap draft of bilat
                            treaty as mistake from their own standpoint, adding that Japan’s only
                            hope for continued freedom from Communist domination lies in liberation
                            of Chi mainland from Communism. He naturally regards his govt as chosen
                            instrument to accomplish such liberation. In attempting analyze Jap
                            motivation <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Generalissimo</persName>
                            expressed fear that they are toying with idea of third force among
                            Chinese. I asked where they expected find such force. He did not answer
                            directly but it may be assumed he had in mind elements which
                            collaborated with Japs during war and which Chi here suspect have been
                            negotiating with Amers more recently.</p>
                        <p>I sympathized with <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Generalissimo</persName>’s disappointment over progress of Chi-Jap
                            talks to date but noted that three important steps had been taken:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. Japs actually sent important treaty del to Taipei.</item>
                            <item>2. Japs agreed to “peace” treaty.</item>
                            <item>3. Japs apparently will treat with Govt of Repub of Chi as such
                                and not as “local” Govt.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I remarked that one more step—admittedly long one—needs to be taken:
                            Conclusion of treaty. I said we must not expect it to be entirely
                            satisfactory to all concerned, but that if it materializes in form which
                            contains nothing definitely unsatisfactory its actual conclusion wld in
                            itself be most important accomplishment from Chi’s standpoint. I
                            expressed appreciation of patience skill and hard work of <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and other responsible Chi
                            officials in this connection.</p>
                        <p>In reply <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Generalissimo</persName> expressed
                            hope of treaty’s early conclusion and repeated his desire for US support
                            in persuading Japs to be reasonable.<note n="4" xml:id="d539fn4">In

                            came to my office on March 13 to discuss the accomplishments of the
                            recent Marquat mission to Washington.<note n="2" xml:id="d540fn2">A
                                group headed by Maj. Gen. W. F. Marquat, Chief of the Economic and
                                Scientific Section of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, had
                                left Tokyo on Jan. 26 and had returned to Tokyo early in

                            George Artamonoff, head of the small <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            staff in Tokyo—the latter at Morrow’s request. This letter has been
                            drafted by Peyton Kerr.</p>
                        <p>Two general subjects were discussed: (1) the prospect for military orders
                            for Japan and (2) the question of establishing a staff in Tokyo to
                            promote economic mobilization and coordination of procurement.</p>
                        <p>Following is a summary of Morrow’s remarks.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Orders for Japan</p>
                        <p>A 10–division military force has been decided upon for Japan and
                            equipment lists have been worked out. The total estimated cost of
                            equipment for these 10 divisions is $777,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Approximately $40–65 million is still available for expenditure in Japan
                            from U.S. military appropriations for fiscal 1952. Working with JLC and
                            other appropriate military groups in Japan, Morrow has been given
                            responsibility for preparing plans for expenditure of these funds in
                            Japan for military equipment. He proposes to complete such plans within
                            30 days.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. military budget for fiscal 1953 will include $300 million for
                            the <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss>. (An additional $300 million
                            is promised for fiscal 1954.) If results obtained through expenditure of
                            the $40–65 million referred to above are satisfactory, approximately
                            $110 million of these funds will be spent in Japan. This $110 million
                            plus $40 million from fiscal 1952 appropriations make up the $150
                            million referred to by General Marquat in his press release of March 11,
                            1952. (Despatch 1263, March 15, 1952.)<note n="4" xml:id="d540fn4">Not
                                printed. (894.10/3–1552)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The United States wishes to dispose of certain equipment. With respect to
                            vehicles, U.S. forces are to be completely re-equipped <pb xml:id="pg_1215" n="1215" facs="0159"/>with new-model jeeps and 6 x
                            6 trucks by December 1953. For this reason, the question of whether (and
                            to what extent) the <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> should be
                            supplied with second-hand equipment takes on added importance. Morrow
                            predicts that vehicles supplied to the <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> will be a combination of rebuilt and new construction
                            in Japan. There are approximately 100,000 vehicles in the Far East
                            available for a rebuilding program. Rebuilding means expenditure of
                            $1,400 per unit in Japan, a total potential expenditure therefore of
                            $140,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The estimate of $777 million for the total cost of equipment for 10
                            divisions is “phony” in the sense that Japan is to be charged
                            replacement cost for the rebuilt jeeps and trucks. This estimate also
                            includes a substantial charge for crating and shipping. Shipping charges
                            can be earned by Japan to the extent that Japanese ships are available.
                            A bill, sponsored by the Defense Department, to make 50 ships from the
                            reserve fleet available to Japan will be introduced within two
                            weeks.</p>
                        <p>The above figures are for the <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> and
                            do not include the possibility of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>
                            off-shore procurement in Japan. The first order from <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> funds to be placed in Japan amounts
                            to $7 million for equipment for Indo-China. As in the case of <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> equipment, Morrow predicts that
                            results obtained from this order will determine the extent of additional
                                <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> off-shore procurement in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>We had been previously informed of a controversy in Washington over
                            whether U.S. military appropriations should be used to maintain the U.S.
                            military production base or should be used in part for off-shore
                            procurement. A recent telegram indicated that this controversy had been
                            resolved and that off-shore procurement in Japan would be comparatively
                            small. In view of the discrepancy between this telegram and Morrow’s
                            relatively optimistic figures for prospective military expenditures in
                            Japan, we asked him whether the controversy referred to had in fact been
                            resolved. He indicated that he thought it has not been resolved
                            completely.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the question of an economic mobilization staff in Tokyo,
                            Morrow indicated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>,
                            Under <hi rend="italic">[Deputy]</hi> Secretary of Defense, favors
                            establishment of such a staff by <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> but
                            that a majority of the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> legal staff
                            considers that this is impossible under present <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> legislation. <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> does
                            not want to set up such a staff for the added reason that such a move
                            would give rise to pressure from Japan for an aid program. On March 12,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> issued an order
                            designating the Army as the coordinating agency for off-shore
                            procurement but Japan was omitted, apparently because it was considered
                            “that <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> had adequate authority”.
                            Morrow indicated that opinion is divided within the Department as <pb xml:id="pg_1216" n="1216" facs="0160"/>to whether such a staff
                            should be a part of the Embassy. He indicated further that, if this
                            staff is in the Embassy, the Department had agreed that salaries would
                            be more or less in line with those to which <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> personnel have become accustomed. He stated further
                            that the Department is interested in recruiting only himself and
                            approximately 10 other members of Morrow’s own staff in <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> and is not interested in other top
                            echelon <gloss target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> officials. He urged that a
                            decision be expedited because it has been necessary to drop two
                            additional members of his staff (his price man and his labor-force man),
                            since he returned from Washington to meet reduction-inforce
                            requirements, and because he himself must decide among alternative
                            employment offers he has received.</p>
                        <p>I have sent a separate letter to you on the subject of an
                            economicmobilization staff in Tokyo.<note n="5" xml:id="d540fn5">Dated

                        <p>On March 20, the Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification
                            (without reservations) of the Japanese Peace Treaty and the three
                            Pacific security treaties. The vote on the Peace Treaty was 66–10; that
                            on the Security Treaty between the United States and Japan was 58–9.</p>
                        <p>Although no reservations were adopted, the Senate did make a
                            “declaration” with respect to its action: “As part of such advice and
                            consent the Senate states that nothing the treaty contains is deemed to
                            dimish or prejudice, in favor of the Soviet Union, the right, title, and
                            interest of Japan, or the Allied Powers as defined in said treaty, in
                            and to South Sakhalin and its adjacent islands, the Kurile Islands, the
                            Habomai Islands, the island of Shikotan, or any other territory, rights,
                            or interests possessed by Japan on December 7, 1941, or to confer any
                            right, title, or benefit therein or thereto on the Soviet Union; and
                            also that nothing in the said treaty, or the advice and consent of the
                            Senate to the ratification thereof, implies recognition on the part of
                            the United States of the provisions in favor of the Soviet Union of the
                            so-called ‘Yalta agreement’ regarding Japan of February 11, 1945.”

                        <p>The proposed reservation to the Japanese Peace Treaty to the effect that
                            “China” shall be deemed to be the National Government got 29 votes
                            against 48. This was despite the fact that the reservation was
                            vigorously opposed by both Senator Smith and Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName>, who are known as being
                            staunch supporters of the National regime.</p>
                        <p>The Senate attitude on this matter makes it quite apparent to me that the
                            reservation would have been adopted had the Japanese Government not
                            taken the decision to deal with the Nationals on the terms of Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s letter to me of
                            December 24.</p>
                        <p>The reservation, if adopted, would have involved an attempt to impose our
                            particular Chinese views in the Treaty itself and would have been
                            rejected by a large number of the other signatories with the result that
                            the entire Treaty structure would have collapsed.</p>

                            as what seems to me was clearly the alternative.</p>

                        <p>7. Speaking of the Communist threat in Japan, he [<persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>] outlined his plan of shortly
                            beginning a campaign of education of the Japanese people, an element of
                            which would be the sending of representatives of the Liberal Party
                            throughout the country districts of Japan, because he said the farmers
                            were substantial people and honest thinkers. “From here,” he pointed
                            out, “the people, understanding the Communist threat, would themselves
                            demand that Japan provide its own protection by rearming.”</p>
                        <p>“Rather than me urging rearmament,” he said, “I want the demand for it
                            and for revision of the Constitution to permit it, to come from the
                            people. Under this plan I feel sure it will. We are going to watch a
                            Gallup poll and when we get about two-thirds who demand rearmament, then
                            the Government can move openly in that direction.”</p>
                        <p>“If the Government should try to move now in that direction, it would
                            find itself strongly attacked by the Opposition and probably saddled
                            with a lot of members of the extreme Right, former Generals and Admirals
                            particularly.” “Neither the extreme Right nor the extreme Left,” he
                            said, “would be good for my people. We want the support of the
                            middle-of-the-roaders, and that is why the farm population, with its
                            honesty and stability, is so important.”<note n="2" xml:id="d543fn2">
                                <p>In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> concerning a conversation held May 23 in
                                    Washington with General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> reported the General’s views on Japanese
                                    rearmament as follows:</p>
                                <p>“Japanese rearmament is impeded (a) by financial considerations
                                    and (b) by the fact that the Prime Minister is determined not to
                                    allow the reconstitution of the traditional officer caste. The
                                    General approves of this attitude regarding officers and has
                                    confidence that the Japanese are handling the problem of
                                    rearmament wisely within the limitations of their capabilities.
                                    He says there is a psychological difficulty in our having first
                                    indoctrinated the Japanese people with the undesirability of
                                    having land forces and now being faced with the necessity of
                                    indoctrinating them in the desirability of so doing.”

                        <p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>: The questions
                            outlined in your letter of 7 February 1952, which you indicated would
                            serve as a basis for drafting an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            paper on Japan, have been considered by this office, the staff of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Munitions Board, and other interested offices
                            within the Department of Defense. Accordingly, the following information
                            is submitted for use in preparing a draft <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper. It might be mentioned that these views are, for
                            the present, informal and will be subject to further review at the time
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper is circulated for comment.
                            Some of the following information has already been furnished your staff
                            in discussions with representatives of this office.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The effective potential over the next few
                            years of United States and Japanese military forces in Japan in
                            resisting attack.</p>
                        <p>A. It is vitally desirable, from a U.S. security viewpoint, to defend
                            Japan against attack. This defense is desirable to the point of
                            acceptance of war in its accomplishment. It is probable that U.S. forces
                            in collaboration and cooperation with the Japanese National Police
                            Reserve will be able to maintain the security of Japan from external
                            aggression.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. It is probable that all of Japan can be held against attack.
                                Even if the island of Hokkaido were invaded and portions of that
                                island occupied by Soviet forces launching an attack from Sakhalin,
                                the mission of our forces will be to regain that territory.</item>
                            <item>2. A large part of Japanese production facilities would be unable
                                to remain in operation in event of hostilities due to enemy air
                                attack from nearby bases. It is believed that the nearness of enemy
                                    <pb xml:id="pg_1220" n="1220" facs="0164"/>air bases would pose
                                a situation that would render it very difficult to prevent
                                large-scale bombing of the Japanese industries. However, even with
                                the mass aerial offensive by U.S. air during World War II large
                                segments of Japanese industry remained in operation. Some guidance
                                by the United States will be required in the restoration of Japanese
                                industry in order that it be so located as to prevent large-scale
                                destruction by hostile air.</item>
                            <item>3. The answer to this question will be supplied within the next

                            Secretary of Defense from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 12 December 1951,

                                of ten divisions to be reached by 31 March 1954. The Japanese
                                division equals in strength and armament one U.S. division with the
                                exception of the omission of the divisional tank battalion.
                                Regimental tank companies, however, are included. The Japanese
                                division slice is approximately 25,000 men. For further information

                            capacity for the production of military supplies and implements of
                            war.</p>
                        <p>A. As has already been stated the equipment for four divisions of the
                                <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> is already in Japan. Equipment
                            now being supplied to the <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> is
                            furnished from the budget of the U.S. Army and this will continue until
                            such time as Japan becomes a completely independent state. After that
                            time, what priority will be assigned for delivery of military equipment
                            to Japan is not known. However, as has been stated above, U.S. forces
                            withdrawing from Japan and Korea will leave their equipment for the
                            arming of Japanese forces. This primarily refers to ground forces.
                            However, certain equipment and supplies will no doubt also be made
                            available by withdrawing Naval and Air Forces. Because of this situation
                            scarcities and delays in U.S. industrial production will not affect the
                            ability of the United States to supply forces in Japan as much as it
                            will affect our ability to supply forces elsewhere.</p>

                            <item>1. This question was answered to some extent in A above.
                                Specifically, there is now a shortage of wheeled equipment such as
                                the ¼ ton, ¾ ton, and 2 ½ ton trucks. The omission of the tank
                                battalion from the Japanese division was not dictated because of
                                shortages, rather it is because of the limited road net in Japan and
                                the nature of the terrain which makes most of Japan poor tank
                                country. The shortage of wheeled vehicles also will not be so
                                disadvantageous to military operations on Japan as it would be in
                                countries with highly developed road nets where the terrain is
                                relatively flat.</item>
                            <item>2. 1954. It is believed that at that time and after that time it
                                will be difficult to obtain direct appropriations for military aid
                                to Japan.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>B. 1. It is believed that Japanese industry should produce certain types
                            of ammunition for U.S. forces in Japan.</p>
                        <p>2. It is probably not realistic to expect Japanese industry to furnish
                            military supplies and equipment for U.S. forces stationed elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>3. Japanese industry should furnish ammunition, clothes, equipment and
                            all but the heaviest of weapons for Japanese security forces.</p>
                        <p>4. Other friendly forces in Asia can be supplied with ammunition and
                            light military equipment by Japanese industry. This would be
                            advantageous to the United States and beneficial to the economy of
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>C. 1. Encouragement of Japanese light armament industry is necessary at
                            the present time. It is believed that in the period following <pb xml:id="pg_1222" n="1222" facs="0166"/>a complete independence of
                            Japan it will be more difficult as time progresses to discourage the
                            Japanese from developing heavy armament industries. The United States
                            will be in a position to some extent to curtail the developing of
                            Japanese heavy armament industries through economic controls and the
                            curtailment of exports of raw materials. However, it is too early to
                            state that such discouragement would be to our advantage.</p>

                            Occupied Areas Office, in each of which I have touched lightly on the
                            question of the eventual return of the Ryukyu and the Bonin Islands. In
                            each instance the view was expressed that Defense is split on the
                            question but that the Joint Chiefs, especially General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName>, are most reluctant to move
                            in the direction of the Department’s point of view. In each case I
                            inquired why the distinction has been made between these lesser islands
                            and the main Japanese islands; why the same arrangement for them would
                            not be satisfactory. The explanation was given that General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName> had felt strongly that no
                            change in the status of the main islands should be made until after the
                            termination of the war in Korea and that he and the Joint Chiefs went
                            along most reluctantly under the pressure of a major political decision.
                            The Joint Chiefs, however, are determined to stand fast regarding the
                            Ryukyus especially, although there is considerable sentiment in other
                            parts of Defense in favor of a relaxation, particularly as the Ryukyus
                            are administratively and economically a burden. General Hamblen
                            expressed the opinion that it would be necessary for a trial period to
                            elapse in order to determine the effectiveness of our arrangements for
                            the main Japanese islands. If a concession were <pb xml:id="pg_1223" n="1223" facs="0167"/>made regarding the Ryukyus now and then a
                            little later we were faced with failure of our arrangements for the main
                            islands, we would be subject to double criticism for having yielded
                            prematurely regarding the Ryukyus. The importance strategically of the
                            latter islands to our defense establishment is too great to experiment
                            with lightly. General Hamblen thought that a year’s trial would be an
                            adequate period in which to determine the efficacy of the present
                            arrangements. Incidentally, General Hamblen disclosed to me voluntarily
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> had made a
                            recommendation to Defense favorable to the immediate transfer of the
                            Ryukyus and the Bonin Islands under circumstances similar to those
                            related to the main islands.</p>

                        <p>My Dear Senator Smith: You have asked whether the Security Treaty with
                            Australia and New Zealand, the Security Treaty with Japan, and the
                            Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines would bind the United States
                            to go to war in the event that any of these four countries is attacked
                            by an outside power.</p>
                        <p>The Security Treaty with Australia and New Zealand and the Mutual Defense
                            Treaty with the Philippines specifically state that each Party recognize
                            that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of the Parties would be
                            dangerous to its own peace and safety and provide that in such an
                            eventuality each Party would act to meet the common danger <hi rend="italic">in accordance with its Constitutional processes</hi>.
                            Thus, the United States would not be automatically drawn into a war
                            involving these three countries.</p>
                        <p>The Security Treaty with Japan provides that the United States shall have
                            the right to station forces in and about Japan and that such forces may
                            be utilized to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and
                            security in the Far East and to the security of Japan. The Treaty does
                            not legally bind the United States to fight in the event that Japan is
                            attacked; it simply makes available to the United States strategic bases
                            and facilities for its use in the event that it determines to help
                            defend Japan.</p>
                        <p>In considering these three treaties it should be borne in mind that they
                            are not intended to involve the United States in a war; as <pb xml:id="pg_1224" n="1224" facs="0168"/>a matter of fact they are
                            carefully worded to avoid any automatic involvement on the part of the
                            United States. The essential purpose of these treaties is to deter any
                            would-be aggressor from attacking certain countries which the United
                            States considers to be of the utmost importance to its own security. In
                            effect, the treaties serve notice on such a would-be aggressor that the
                            United States is deeply concerned with the maintenance of peace and
                            security in this area and will take appropriate steps to help maintain
                            peace and security in the event of an armed attack on the area.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHF1">Matthews</persName>: We thought it would
                            be useful to talk over the Ryukyus problem. We don’t expect a decision,
                            but we thought with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> here it would be useful to exchange views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>: The issue was brought
                            to a head by the negotiation of the Administrative Agreement. Article 3
                            reserves our rights and powers over the Ryukyus and gives us authority
                            to set up a trusteeship if we should want one, and to administer the
                            islands pending our decision. We realize that the fundamental U.S.
                            policy is to <pb xml:id="pg_1225" n="1225" facs="0169"/>retain long-term
                            strategic control of the Ryukyus, and we take this as our basic
                            objective. There has been, however, great to do in Japan over the
                            Administrative Agreement. We must take Japanese opinion into account.
                            There are some obvious disadvantages to a trusteeship. It would make us
                            responsible for one million people, it would create expenses for us in
                            maintaining the islands, and it might have an adverse effect in our long
                            term ties with the Japanese. Our feeling has been that it would be
                            useful if we could make a political gesture of agreeing to Japanese
                            sovereignty over the islands and obtain agreement with the Japanese for
                            any military rights that may be necessary. These rights would not have
                            to be limited to those provided for in the Administrative Agreement.
                            There is also the possibility that we might make definite arrangements
                            for Okinawa as against those for the other islands. The decision should
                            be made soon, and we believe it would be useful to set up a joint
                            committee between State and Defense to work out our position.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>:<note n="3" xml:id="d547fn3">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> left Tokyo for Washington on Mar. 18.</note>
                            As matters stand now, the Japanese have residual sovereignty over the
                            Nansei Islands. There are many unresolved questions as to what this
                            means. For example, who issues travel documents, etc? There is also a
                            political problem—the rising desire on the part of the inhabitants to
                            return to Japan. There is a petition from the Amani-O-Shima to this
                            effect, which was signed by a large percentage of the population. There
                            is also interest in the problem of Japan itself. If we don’t settle it
                            soon, we may have considerable irredentist feeling in Japan. From my
                            talks with Japanese officials, I believe there is no problem in our
                            securing control over anything we actually need. The Japanese realize
                            Okinawa is important to the United States and also that our presence
                            there is important to them. At the present time and for the next three
                            to six months, our negotiating position is strong. The Japanese,
                            however, don’t want us to have a trusteeship. I believe that if we made
                            some political gesture to the Japanese along lines of sovereignty, it
                            would help Japanese reaction to the Administrative Agreement.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_VGHS1">Vandenberg</persName>: What effect
                            would this have on court martial rights? Supposing an airman runs down a
                            native. Who would try him? Or what would happen if we wanted to move a
                            considerable amount of the population away from some dangerous area, or
                            to move people to build additional airfields?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>: Things like
                            this could be worked out in negotiations. We might set up a joint
                            board.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_VGHS1">Vandenberg</persName>: Our
                            experience in Newfoundland and elsewhere has been difficult. If we are
                            going to wage atomic war, which <pb xml:id="pg_1226" n="1226" facs="0170"/>might be unpopular with the Japanese, we would have to
                            have a free hand. If we didn’t have a free hand we would lose 90 per
                            cent of the value of the base.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>: I can see major
                            problems. There are five airfields there now. Supposing the Okinawans
                            say there isn’t enough farm land and we should have only one. They would
                            appeal to the Japanese Government and we would be in all sorts of
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_VGHS1">Vandenberg</persName>: Or else we
                            might want seven airfields or we might want to make extended airfields
                            and we would get into more problems.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>: Couldn’t this
                            be worked out by a committee to meet the terms of your actual
                            requirements?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName>: There are some
                            other problems in this. We would like to have a base at Okinawa. The
                            question is, can we get it other than by agreement for trusteeship.
                            Maybe we can work out an agreement with the Japanese Government. The
                            example of Egypt and the British isn’t a very hopeful one, and Japan may
                            not always be in our corner. Moreover, it isn’t just Okinawa. We need
                            warning services if we have a major base on Okinawa and this would mean
                            we would need facilities on the other islands.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>: We don’t
                            envisage staying in Japan indefinitely, but if we build up Okinawa into
                            a major base we do envisage staying there indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName>: There is the
                            other question as to whether we can get funds from Congress for anything
                            short of this sort of permanent base that a trusteeship would
                            involve.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Fechteler</persName>: I wonder if I
                            could ask why Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>
                            puts emphasis on our bargaining position in the next three to six
                            months.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>: Just because
                            the more time that elapses the more Japanese political pressure will
                            grow and it may reach a point where no Japanese government can stand up
                            against it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: As long as the question
                            is unresolved, public interest will build up.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>: General
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName> mentioned the need
                            for other islands. Can you say specifically what other islands you
                            mean?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_VGHS1">Vandenberg</persName>: During the
                            war we had airfields between Okinawa and Guam. It’s hard to tell what
                            you need for air warning, but early warning facilities are
                            imperative.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cowen: How much pressure is generated by the desire of the
                            people of the islands to return to Japan, and how much pressure comes
                            from the desire of the Japanese to have them returned.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1227" n="1227" facs="0171"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>: The people of
                            the islands are practically unanimous in their desire to return to
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cowen: Are the Japanese people able to provide the deficit
                            assistance that the islands need?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName>: I doubt it.
                            Three years ago I rather thought Okinawans liked the setup under U.S.
                            Administration. As I see it, it really boils down to whether or not we
                            pull back our Pacific defense line or not. I agree with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>—I doubt if the local
                            people would want to be part of Japan and still have the U.S.
                            around.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName>: I don’t think we
                            should rush into a decision to give Okinawa back. The Japanese are going
                            to have differences with us about trade with the mainland. They are not
                            going to want U.S. troops in Japan indefinitely. We are liable to have
                            real differences of opinion with the Japanese, but in Okinawa we already
                            have permanent constructions and we should think seriously about giving
                            up our base there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>: There is no question
                            but that we want to have a base there. What we want to do is work out
                            with you your specifications.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Fechteler</persName>: What’s the
                            pressure for the return of the Bonins?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>: No real
                            pressure, it’s just sentimental reasons.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Fechteler</persName>: The Bonins are
                            of real value to the Navy. Mr. Cowen: But a naval base does not go into
                            the interior of the island.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGAON1">Bradley</persName>: If you give

                            to give up the rest. Our position in Japan is temporary, but if we are
                            going to stay in Okinawa we should stay there permanently. If you want a
                            joint group to work up our position we could designate our plans

                                    President stated that important powers of the U.S. Government
                                    would lapse if the Japanese Peace Treaty was brought into force
                                    prior to enactment of the Emergency Powers Continuation Bill
                                    then before the Congress. The President added:</p>
                                <p>“In view of the serious doubt, as matters now stand, whether that
                                    act can be enacted before April 16, the date on which it was
                                    hoped the Treaty could be brought into effect, I would like your
                                    immediate recommendation as to further postponement of the
                                    effective date of the Treaty. Until we can discuss this, please
                                    make no announcement that will establish irrevocably a date for
                                    bringing the Treaty into force.” (694.001/4–152)</p>
                            </note> the
                            Department of State is withholding any announcement establishing an
                            irrevocable date for bringing the Treaty of Peace with Japan into
                            force.</p>
                        <p>For the following reasons I strongly recommend that every possible effort
                            be made to bring the Treaty into effect on or about April 16 or within
                            not more than ten days thereafter:</p>
                        <p>1. Since the beginning of the negotiations for the Treaty the United
                            States has consistently urged the great importance of concluding peace
                            with Japan as quickly as possible. The Treaty provides that it will come
                            into effect when the ratifications of six named countries, including the
                            United States, have been deposited with the United States. Five
                            countries other than the United States have now completed the
                            ratification procedures and it is expected will very shortly deposit
                            their ratifications. This fact is well known to the Japanese and
                            therefore any substantial delay by the United States in bringing the
                            Treaty into effect will receive prominent attention in Japan, and unless
                            the reasons therefor are such as to appeal to the Japanese as being of
                            overwhelming importance the reactions against the United States can well
                            be expected to be very adverse.</p>
                        <p>2. The desire of the Japanese that the Treaty be brought into effect as
                            soon as possible was a major factor in expediting recent negotiations on
                            the Administrative Agreement for stationing of United States forces in
                            Japan in accordance with the Security Treaty and the undertaking by the
                            Japanese of negotiations of a peace treaty with the Chinese Nationalist
                            Government. Those steps having been taken, the Japanese Government and
                            people would be <pb xml:id="pg_1229" n="1229" facs="0173"/>very
                            disturbed at any material delay by the United States Government in
                            bringing the Treaty into effect, and elements unfriendly to the United
                            States and Japan could be expected to exploit the situation to the
                            maximum.</p>
                        <p>3. Extensive political and administrative arrangements have been made by
                            the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Supreme
                            Commander of the Allied Powers, the United Nations Command, the
                            Government of Japan, and other foreign Governments on the assumption
                            that the Treaty would be coming into effect by the first half of April.
                            Many of these arrangements, such as agreements with foreign Governments
                            on the termination of the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council
                            for Japan; reductions in force by General Headquarters, Supreme
                            Commander for the Allied Powers; turn back of responsibilities to the
                            Japanese Government by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers;
                            personnel arrangements; and other such actions, many of which it is
                            impossible to reverse, have necessarily been in progress for some months
                            past. A major delay in bringing the Treaty into effect will seriously
                            interfere with these plans for an orderly transition from the present
                            occupation status to peacetime relations with Japan. In this connection,
                            it is essential that the Japanese Government and the Departments and
                            Agencies of the United States Government concerned, and desirable that
                            the foreign Governments concerned, be given not less than ten days, and
                            preferably two weeks, advance notice of the firm date of coming into
                            effect of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>4. Urgent negotiations are now being carried on with the Japanese
                            concerning the arrangements for Japanese support of the United Nations
                            operations in Korea and for the presence in Japan of troops of United
                            Nations countries other than the United States engaged in the Korean
                            hostilities. There have been some indications that the Australian and
                            New Zealand Governments may attempt to withhold deposit of their
                            ratifications of the Treaty in an effort to bring pressure on the
                            Japanese to accede in such arrangements to some provisions that are
                            repugnant to the Japanese and considered undesirable by the United
                            States Government. The United States Government is not in a position
                            effectively to oppose these efforts until such time as it, itself, is
                            clearly prepared to bring the Treaty into effect as far as it is
                            concerned and thereby place upon the Australian and New Zealand
                            Governments the full onus of any delay. Also, if the Japanese are aware
                            that the United States is not in any event bringing the Treaty into
                            effect for some time the present incentive to expedite the completion of
                            negotiations of this agreement on terms satisfactory to the Unified
                            Command is removed.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, I strongly recommend that a Joint Resolution extending your
                            Emergency Powers for sixty days, as suggested in the last paragraph of
                            the memorandum from the Director of the Bureau of the Budget enclosed
                            with your memorandum,<note n="3" xml:id="d548fn3">

                                    to the President’s memorandum. In a memorandum to the Secretary
                                    dated Apr. 3, <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>
                                    summarized it as follows:</p>
                                <p>“The memorandum from the Director of the Bureau of the Budget
                                    enclosed in the President’s memorandum notes that the Emergency
                                    Powers Continuation Act is now in subcommittee of the Judiciary
                                    Committee of the House and that unless extraordinary measures
                                    are taken, at least three to four weeks will be required by the
                                    House to act on the legislation, following which at least a
                                    similar period of time will be required for consideration in the
                                    Senate. Therefore, if the Treaty of Peace with Japan is not to
                                    be brought into effect until normal legislative action is
                                    completed on the measure, it appears that the coming into effect
                                    of the Treaty may be delayed for at least several months.”</p>
                                <p>Elsewhere in his memorandum <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> stated:</p>
                                <p>“As early as October, 1951 the Bureau of the Budget expressed to
                                    the Department the realization that enactment of legislation for
                                    continuation of the President’s emergency powers would probably
                                    be required if those powers were to be continued into the
                                    post-treaty period. All such planning has been based on the
                                    assumption that the Treaty of Peace with Japan would be brought
                                    into effect not later than April of this year and at the time
                                    the question was first discussed in October of last year it was
                                    the understanding of the Department of State that the Bureau of
                                    the Budget was undertaking whatever arrangements it considered
                                    necessary.” (694.001/ 4–152)</p>

                            from the Congress on a most urgent basis. I have discussed this matter
                            with the Secretary of Defense and the Departments of State and Defense
                            will be prepared to give all possible assistance in obtaining prompt and

                            future and explore the sensitive nerves of Japan’s political life. By
                            way of illustration there are the following matters regarding Japanese
                            rearmament which raise critical political issues:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. The very question of rearmament is an acute political issue in
                                Japan since it involves the complicated question of constitutional
                                amendment, alignment of political parties and basic Japanese foreign
                                relations, particularly vis-à-vis the Soviet Union and the United
                                States. Any action by us in this connection can create serious
                                political repercussions in Japan. The nature and timing of an
                                announcement of the letting of munitions contracts or of an
                                intention to turn over heavy military equipment to the National
                                Police Reserve could have a profound influence upon a Japanese
                                domestic election, and could threaten the overthrow of the present
                                Japanese Government.</item>
                            <item>2. The expansion of Japanese defense forces—ground, air and
                                naval—creates an equally acute issue in international relations.
                                Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, the Philippines,
                                and Indonesia have all expressed at various times their concern lest
                                Japanese rearmament proceed too rapidly and Japanese militarism
                                revive. Japan’s relations with Korea will likewise be vitally
                                affected by what is done to rearm Japan.</item>
                            <item>3. The construction of facilities in Japan from United States
                                funds will affect the economic and social life of the Japanese
                                people in many areas of Japan. The State Department should be fully
                                informed, and should be consulted, regarding the size, location and
                                timing of such construction. As a result of questions raised by the
                                Bureau of the Budget, this problem is on the way to solution.</item>
                            <item>4. The allocation of Japanese funds either for the construction of
                                United States facilities or for Japanese defense forces involves
                                Japanese budgetary questions that affect other public activities in
                                Japan as well as the general political issue of rearmament and
                                expansion of the National Police Reserve. Relations between the
                                Japanese and United States Governments on this particular question
                                cannot be left solely to United States military channels.</item>
                            <item>5. The utilization of Japanese industrial resources for military
                                and other purposes will be a complex arrangement of many
                                interrelated factors. Competition for scarce materials and
                                facilities as <pb xml:id="pg_1232" n="1232" facs="0176"/>well as the
                                possibility of price rises owing to competitive bidding can
                                seriously affect the Japanese economy.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The responsible military authorities in the United States Government are
                            anxious to build up Japanese forces as a counterweight to Communist
                            military strength in the Far East. There is a constant tendency on the
                            part of American military officials to surge ahead on Japanese
                            rearmament with little regard for its political impact. With all due
                            respect to the important and cogent military requirements of the
                            situation in the Far East and in Japan, the interests of the American
                            people will benefit from close understanding between both Departments on
                            this matter. Skillful handling of its explosive potential will be
                            possible only with such understanding.</p>

                        <p>Telegram 2079 of April 1, 1952, from Tokyo (attached as Tab A)<note n="1" xml:id="d549fn1">Not printed.</note> describes a specific situation
                            in this general field in which it is desirable that there be
                            intervention by the Department of State, since there are important
                            political implications to the actions now being taken by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese budget for their fiscal year which began April 1 includes 57
                            billion yen for the National Police Reserve. It also appropriates 56
                            billion yen for undisclosed security objects. General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> has been urging Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> to double the size of
                            the National Police Reserve during this fiscal year and to use all of
                            the 56 billion yen for that purpose. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> is wary of the serious internal political
                            problems involved in moving rapidly ahead with such an expansion
                            program, and has never committed himself—at least publicly—to anything
                            more than an increase from the present strength of 75,000 to a strength
                            of 110,000.<note n="2" xml:id="d549fn2">In <gloss target="#t_Topad1">Topad</gloss> 2079 <persName corresp="#p_BNW1">Bond</persName>

                                (611.94/4152)</note> This increase would not require all of the
                            available funds, so he has proposed that some portion of the money be
                            used to construct facilities into which United States troops could be
                            moved as part of the program of relocation outside of major metropolitan
                            centers. Probably as a means of blocking this suggestion, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> recently announced
                            in Tokyo that the Japanese Government would not have to pay a cent for
                            the relocation of United States troops.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, the Department of Defense is endeavoring to secure the
                            release of approximately $50,000,000 of this year’s funds and the
                            authorization of $80,000,000 in the Public Works Authorization <pb xml:id="pg_1233" n="1233" facs="0177"/>Bill for the next fiscal year
                            for the construction of new facilities in Japan. The new authorization
                            would be added to a continuing authorization of $50,000,000 in this
                            year’s budget for which no appropriation has yet been made. We have
                            informally told both Defense and the Bureau of the Budget that we are
                            heartily in favor of the immediate release of the $50,000,000 and that
                            subject to a review of the general scope and nature of the proposed
                            program we would support the request for funds in fiscal year 1953.
                            Arrangements have been made for such a review.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that the Japanese can construct facilities out of their own
                            budgeted funds, the United States will be relieved of an item of
                            expense. In addition, the political factors involved in Japan are so
                            serious that too rapid an expansion of the National Police Reserve
                            before the Liberal Party has had time to prepare the way might cause the
                            downfall of the present government. Since the very presence of United
                            States troops in Japan creates an incentive for the Japanese to move
                            ahead with building up their own forces and thus rid Japan of foreign
                            troops, it does not seem desirable to exert pressure upon them to move
                            at a rate which they believe to be politically suicidal.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss> 66619. 1. With the early coming into
                            force of the Peace Treaty and the changing status of Japan from that of
                            an occupied country to that of a sovereign nation, I feel it incumbent
                            upon me to present for your consideration my views on certain matters
                            relating to US military policy in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>2. A. The most vital factor in the achievement of US objectives in the
                            Orient is the continued maintenance of Japanese faith in our commitment
                            to guarantee the essential security of Japan, until it is capable of
                            assuming that responsibility of a sovereign state. During my service as
                                <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> I have several times heard
                            influential Japanese express such deep concern over the possible lack of
                            continuity of US intentions to protect Japan as to amount almost to
                            fear. On each such occasion I have sought to impress upon the
                            individuals concerned, and later upon the highest Japanese governmental
                            authorities, the firm intention of the US to provide essential
                            protection to Japan during that period when Japan is creating the
                            essential forces to permit her to assume responsibility for her own
                            defense. With the effectuation of the treaties it will, I think, become
                            more than ever important to US interests that our long range intentions
                            be made positive and clear, and that this be done from time to time so
                            as to preclude the building-up in the Japanese mind of any idea, however
                            weakly founded, that we do not in fact intend to continue our protective
                            shield over them until they can substitute one of their own. The factor
                            of possible political pressure for economic advantage, in this expressed
                            concern by Japanese, is of course recognized.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese, in common with other Oriental peoples outside the Soviet
                            orbit, will be subject to steadily mounting internal and external
                            pressures directed from the Kremlin. They will be ever mindful of their
                            close proximity to a Communist dominated Asiatic mainland and ever alert
                            to any indication of a weakening in our political or military policies
                            toward them. Japanese response to US leadership will be predicated upon
                            a constant realistic appraisal of US intentions and commitments on a
                            positive and long range basis. What they think our intentions are, may
                            be even more important than what these intentions actually are.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1237" n="1237" facs="0181"/>
                        <p>Therefore I suggest that at an appropriate time shortly after the coming
                            into effect of the Security Pact, the Japanese be publicly and
                            authoritatively reassured of our firm intentions. While such a statement
                            should go far toward allaying any trepidation on the part of the
                            Japanese, there must necessarily be continued concrete assistance toward
                            the development of essential Japanese Security Forces, and continued
                            insistence that Japan shall make proper and timely contribution
                            thereto.</p>
                        <p>B. The programs for development of the security forces of Japan and Korea
                            are closely interrelated and a proper and controlled balance must be
                            maintained. US support and maintenance of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Military Forces, if unrelated to similar assistance to
                            Japan, could have serious adverse effects on our relations with both
                            governments, and consequently upon our Far East position. It may be that
                            a bilateral security pact between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, however infeasible at this time, could later
                            eventuate, and even perhaps, at a still more distant date, be a prelude
                            to a more encompassing Pacific security pact embracing the other free
                            nations of the Orient. If so, then the interrelation of US programs for
                            arming Chinese Nationalist and Southeast Asian forces likewise has
                            important bearing, political as well as military, on our Japanese and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> programs.</p>
                        <p>C. In due time Japan may be expected to seek membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.<note n="1" xml:id="d551fn1">For
                                documentation on this question, see <ref target="frus1952-54v03">vol. III</ref>, pp. 802 ff.</note> That her people have an
                            awareness of the responsibilities which such membership entails, and a
                            desire to meet these responsibilities, has been adequately demonstrated
                            both spiritually and materially. Despite subversive efforts intended to
                            spread disunity in Japan there has been conspicuous accord if <hi rend="italic">[in?]</hi> the manner in which the great majority of
                            Japan’s agricultural and industrial workers have thrown themselves
                            behind the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s war effort in Korea. Her
                            churches and charitable institutions, from their own meager resources,
                            responded immediately to alleviate conditions among war ravaged Korean
                            families, and thousands of Japanese have given their blood for the care
                            of our wounded. Japan’s request for membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organization should, I think, be provided
                            full US support. While realizing the objections to be overcome, our
                            support would further provide positive proof to the Japanese as to which
                            nations were friends and which enemies.</p>
                        <p>3. These views are submitted because of the imminent and unlamented
                            demise of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. Summarizing:</p>
                        <p>A. I consider it of signal importance that our government, as often as
                            may be necessary, seek to reassure the Japanese people <pb xml:id="pg_1238" n="1238" facs="0182"/>that our policy toward Japan
                            will remain constant, and that our security interests in the Pacific are
                            inseparable from their own.</p>
                        <p>B. We must be ever alert to the intimate relationship between the
                            development of the Japanese and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            security forces and the need for their joint alignment against a common
                            foe. Moreover, the development of Chinese Nationalist and Southeast
                            Asian military forces is in turn a closely related problem.</p>
                        <p>C. We must continue to press vigorously for completion of the desired
                            expansion of Japanese security forces, and at substantially the rate now
                            programmed.</p>
                        <p>D. Japan should receive strong US support in her endeavor to secure
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, including, I
                            believe, an authoritative US government statement to that effect,
                            published shortly following the effective date of the treaties. Even
                            though membership should be long delayed, our support would emphasize
                            the integrity of US intentions toward the Japanese people.</p>
                        <p>E. Finally, we must by word and deed do everything within our power to
                            overcome any feeling in the Oriental mind that our interest in Asia is
                            casual, temporary or overshadowed by our interests in other regions.</p>

                            bringing into effect of the Treaty of Peace with Japan, you suggest that
                            he now sign the Instrument of Ratification and transmit it to the

                            it will be possible to give the minimum ten days notice of the date for
                            bringing the Treaty into effect, which would thus be about April 24.</p>

                        <p>1314. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> told me yesterday that
                            lengthy memo handed him Apr 8 by Kawada, embodying latest Jap comments
                            on bilateral <pb xml:id="pg_1241" n="1241" facs="0185"/>treaty, was
                            satisfactory to <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> except for
                            minor points. He was so informing <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Generalissimo</persName> last night. “Minor” points involved
                            questions of phraseology and matters related to entry sojourn fisheries
                            and mining rights. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> thought all
                            of these cld be resolved. In every case Chi Govt wishes adhere more
                            closely to San Francisco text but is willing compromise on working
                            within limits.</p>
                        <p>Wajima called yesterday and informed me he intends return to Tokyo Apr
                            15. He hopes and apparently expects to take back with him an agreed
                            draft for consideration by Jap Cabinet. Latter wld involve about five
                            days, due certain necessary procedures, after which two weeks needed to
                            pass treaty through Diet. Wajima’s latest info is that an American
                            Treaty will become effective about Apr 25. He hoped Diet wld be able act
                            on bilateral treaty before end of session early May.</p>
                        <p>Feeling in Chi Govt circles is that treaty again well on way and only
                            serious hurdle is possibility Jap Govt “repudiating” its del as Chi
                            consider happened on Mar 28.</p>

                            at distance from house and came on foot as he said to avoid reporters.
                            He indicated Kawada thought Tokyo had let him down again and was greatly
                            discouraged. Not only had Japanese <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> refused accept Kawada’s recommendation re scope

                                Diplomatic Mission in Japan and the Commander-inChief, Far
                                East.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Attached as Tab A is a draft memorandum for your approval containing
                            the principles to govern the relationships between the Chief of the
                            United States Diplomatic Mission in Japan and the Commander-in-Chief,
                            Far East, after the Treaty of Peace with Japan and the United
                            States–Japan Security Treaty have come into force. In brief, these
                            principles provide that the Chief of the Diplomatic Mission, as your
                            representative and acting on your behalf, shall be responsible for all
                            governmental relations in Japan between the United States and Japan,
                            that the Commander-inChief, Far East, may deal directly with appropriate
                            representatives of the Japanese Government on military matters, and that
                            all necessary steps shall be taken to ensure concordance and the
                            exchange of necessary information between them.</p>
                        <p>2. Except with respect to military assistance activities, the principles
                            stated in the attached draft memorandum are in general comparable to
                            those which govern the relationship between United States ambassadors
                            and United States military commanders elsewhere in the world.</p>
                        <p>3. The nature of the procedures provided for dealing with matters
                            connected with military assistance to Japan was determined by the
                            following factors:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) Our relations with Japan bear a special importance for all of
                                our policy objectives in the Far East; consequently, the closest
                                coordination of the political, economic, and military aspects of
                                these relations is required.</item>
                            <item>(b) In the immediate future Japan’s security will depend to a
                                large extent on United States military forces.</item>
                            <item>(c) Since it has been considered undesirable to make public before
                                the effective date of the Treaty of Peace the nature and extent of
                                our plans for military assistance to Japan, there is no provision
                                for such assistance in the Mutual Security Act of 1951 or <pb xml:id="pg_1244" n="1244" facs="0188"/>in the program for fiscal
                                year 1953. Funds for this purpose have been included in the
                                Department of Defense budget.</item>
                            <item>(d) In accordance with the Interim Directive which you approved on
                                February 20, 1952, the Commander-in-Chief, Far East is responsible
                                for the participation of the United States in the joint committee
                                provided by Article XXVI of the Administrative Agreement between the
                                United States and Japan.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>4. The Departments of State and Defense have consulted together
                            extensively and have carefully worked out the principles in the attached
                            memorandum. Both Departments are in full accord in this matter.</p>
                        <p>5. It is important that the relationships between the Chief of Diplomatic
                            Mission in Japan and the Commander-in-Chief, Far East be established by
                            the time the Treaty of Peace with Japan and the Security Treaty with
                            Japan and the United States have come into force.</p>
                        <p>6. It is recommended that you approve the attached memorandum.</p>

                            integrity, loyalty, devotion to dy and exemplary conduct, they have
                            helped to write a unique chapter in the annals of the US military
                            establishment and in the history of US Foreign Relations. In so doing,
                            they have helped to establish a firm foundation for a structure of
                            enduring friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Japan and the
                            US.</p>

                            self-explanatory Memorandum of Conversation between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Kumao Nishimura</persName>, Chief of the Treaty
                            Bureau of Ministry of Foreign <pb xml:id="pg_1250" n="1250" facs="0194"/>Affairs, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">R. B. Finn</persName> of
                            the Mission. The Mission suggests the following specific comments
                            regarding the enclosed memorandum:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> indicated
                                his feeling that Japan was going too far toward meeting the position
                                of the National Government of China in the present negotiations and
                                said he had been overruled at least once by the Prime Minister.
                                There have been reports in the press to the effect that certain high
                                officials of the Foreign Office are split in their views as to how
                                far Japan should go in dealing with National China and that Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> was the leader
                                of the “go slow” group. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>’s statements reported in the enclosed
                                memorandum may be evidence in support of these press reports,
                                although he indicated that Japan desires to conclude an agreement
                                with National China.</item>
                            <item>2. The remarks attributed to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> to the effect that Japan
                                might be able to assist the United States in dealing with Far
                                Eastern problems appear to be a reiteration of the Prime Minister’s
                                view that Japan knows more about China than does the United States.
                                It would appear probable that the Prime Minister has not abandoned
                                his idea that Japan should engage in some limited relations with
                                Communist China, possibly to serve as a “fifth column” on behalf of
                                the democracies.</item>
                            <item>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>’s remarks
                                about the more favorable impression of the Administrative Agreement
                                being received by the Japanese appear to conform with the optimistic
                                view he has several times expressed to the effect that once Japanese
                                people understood the Agreement and the intentions of the United
                                States, criticism and resentment would largely subside. At the time
                                the Agreement was being negotiated, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> expressed the opinion that dissatisfaction
                                then being voiced in the press would disappear once the Agreement
                                was made public, an opinion that was not justified by the reception
                                accorded the Agreement on its publication.</item>
                            <item>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>’s comment
                                that depurgees feel resentment toward the United States because of
                                their purge is considered to foreshadow a significant problem in
                                future Japanese relations with the United States, although the
                                future importance of the purgees and the extent of their
                                anti-Americanism are not presently foreseeable.</item>

                        <p>In an informal conversation on April 22 the following matters of possible
                            interest were discussed.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Relations with China</hi>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said that on April 22 Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, Minister of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>, and he had
                            discussed the negotiations now taking place in Taipei. The Prime
                            Minister and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> decided
                            that Japan should attempt by statements in the Official Minutes to meet
                            the position of the National Government regarding the scope of
                            application of the proposed treaty, despite Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>’s objection that Japan was
                            going too far to meet the Chinese position. He also said that Chinese
                            representatives were concerned that the wording of the clause on the
                            treaty’s scope of application (“territories now <hi rend="italic">or</hi> hereafter under control of National Government”) might
                            raise an inference that National China’s claim to Formosa could be
                            subject to some form of United Nations control depending on future
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> letter of
                            December 24 to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said that the Prime
                            Minister had been strongly impressed by his discussion of the China
                            problem at San Francisco with Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_ADG1">Acheson</persName>,<note n="1" xml:id="d562fn1">For a memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>
                                of a conversation held at San Francisco on Sept. 3, 1951, between
                                the Prime Minister and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ADG1">Acheson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, and other American officials, see <ref target="frus1951v06p1">

                                    1951, vol. VI, Part 1</ref>, p. 1315.</note> who had advised
                            Japan not to be “hasty” in making its decision about a peace settlement
                            with China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had
                            therefore been “very much vexed” by later developments in United States
                            policy and by the position taken by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, who had been present at the conversation in San
                            Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> indicated, however,
                            that Japan was fully prepared to make strenuous efforts to reach
                            agreement with National China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> also said the Prime Minister was extremely
                            interested in United States Far Eastern policy and had many times
                            expressed the view that Japan, as an old nation familiar with the Far
                            East, could assist and even guide the United States, which is
                            inexperienced in foreign policy and has got itself in a “circle” on the
                            China question.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Relations with Korea</hi>. Regarding the present
                            negotiations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>
                            observed that the issues raised by the property claims of the two
                            Governments were so complicated that months would be required to settle
                            them. I asked whether the Japanese Government actually expected that it
                            would recover any of its property in Korea, private or public, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said no and added
                                <pb xml:id="pg_1252" n="1252" facs="0196"/>that the Japanese
                            position was designed largely to protect Japan against the excessive
                            claims being made by Korea to property in Japan. I asked how Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> thought the problem
                            would be solved and he said that eventually the Japanese expected a
                            reciprocal waiver of claims and were attempting to maneuver the Koreans
                            into a position where the Koreans would make this proposal. I asked
                            whether the Japanese expected the Koreans to waive their claims to
                            allegedly looted cultural objects, postal savings accounts, wages due
                            conscript labor, and items of that sort, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> replied that Japan hoped to
                            include these items in any reciprocal waiver of claims since the amounts
                            claimed by Korea would probably be very high.</p>
                        <p>I commented that it was desirable for Japan and Korea to have some legal
                            basis for diplomatic relations upon the coming into force of the Peace
                            Treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said that
                            within a few days Japan would propose to the Koreans that notes be
                            exchanged providing for establishment of diplomatic relations; I
                            inferred the Japanese proposal would be made without prejudice to the
                            present discussions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>
                            felt that United States assistance in gaining Korean acceptance of this
                            proposal might be sought.</p>
                        <p>By way of comment, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName>
                            said he thought the San Francisco Treaty was defective in the treatment
                            accorded Japanese external assets, although he agreed with my
                            observation that some such solution as Article XIV, A, 2, was necessary
                            in view of the watered-down reparations provisions of the Treaty. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> also said President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s view that Japan’s
                            control of Korea from 1910 to 1945 was illegal and all acts thereunder
                            null and void posed a serious obstacle to resolution of problems between
                            the two countries and he indicated that he was pessimistic concerning
                            their good relations while President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> remains in office.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Diplomatic Relations with Other Countries</hi>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said the Japanese
                            Government was gratified and encouraged by the cordiality attending its
                            negotiations with a number of other countries for resumption of
                            diplomatic relations. He said this was particularly so in respect to
                            India, with whom relations will be established on April 28 pursuant to
                            exchanges of notes. Similarly, arrangements have been made with Spain,
                            Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Yugoslavia, and apparently several
                            other countries. In the case of the Philippines and Indonesia Japan has
                            proposed that diplomatic relations be resumed on April 28; this proposal
                            will probably be accepted by Indonesia and possibly by the Philippines,
                            despite the failure of both countries to ratify the Peace Treaty,
                            although there is considerable concern in Manila lest the Philippine
                            Senate consider its constitutional prerogatives to be involved.
                            Diplomatic relations with the Netherlands will also be resumed on <pb xml:id="pg_1253" n="1253" facs="0197"/>April 28 by an exchange of
                            notes, although the Netherlands has not yet ratified the Peace
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the Soviet Union Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said the Japanese Government intended to
                            follow closely the policy to be declared or otherwise adopted by the
                            United States in respect to official Soviet activity in Japan. I got the
                            impression that the Japanese do not contemplate issuing any strong
                            statement or taking any strong measures in this regard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> also said that a Soviet vessel
                            is expected to arrive at a Japanese port on or shortly after April 28
                            and that the problem of how to treat its passengers and cargo is now
                            under consideration by the Foreign Office, added emphasis being given to
                            this matter since this will be the first test of post-treaty
                            Japanese-Soviet relations.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Administrative Agreement</hi> I asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> whether in his opinion the
                            Japanese attitude toward the Administrative Agreement and the security
                            arrangements with the United States would prove to be a serious obstacle
                            to good relations between the two countries. He said no and that he felt
                            the Japanese were already gaining a favorable impression of United
                            States intentions, particularly as a result of the accomplishments of
                            the Preliminary Working Group and the understanding attitude of the
                            American representatives in the Group. He expects that future steps to
                            implement the Administrative Agreement will further the good impression
                            already made. I observed that a number of Japanese critics, such as
                            Professors Kisaburo Yokota and Hikomatsu Kawakami, had made sharp
                            attacks on legal points in the Agreement and had gone unchallenged, and
                            I inquired whether the Japanese Government might in some way attempt to
                            present a more balanced picture to the Japanese public. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said the Government was aware
                            of the need for fuller information on the Agreement and that it was
                            planned to issue a pamphlet on April 28 explaining the Agreement and
                            refuting some of the legal criticisms made against it.</p>
                        <p>I asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> felt
                            there had been in connection with the Administrative Agreement any
                            significant development of anti-American feeling in Japan and commented
                            that such a development together with a possible truce in Korea might
                            seriously weaken the desire of many Japanese to cooperate wholeheartedly
                            in the security arrangements with the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> said he thought a truce in
                            Korea would undoubtedly lead many Japanese to believe that the threat to
                            Japan’s security, together with the need for American forces in Japan,
                            was largely ended and that this situation would pose serious problems in
                            the conduct of Japan’s foreign policy. He also said that depurgees were
                            showing marked antipathy toward the United States and he mentioned <pb xml:id="pg_1254" n="1254" facs="0198"/>Professor Kawakami, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Mamoru Shigemitsu</persName>, and former Foreign
                            Minister Hachiro Arita<note n="2" xml:id="d562fn2">Arita had been
                                Foreign Minister several times. His last tenure had been

                            had several times told Foreign Office officials and the Prime Minister
                            that Japan was following an unduly pro-American policy and that this was
                            undesirable for Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nishimura</persName> observed that most purgees could not help
                            being anti-American as an expression of resentment over their treatment
                            under the Occupation.</p>

                        <p>Formal negotiations were commenced at Tokyo on February 15, 1952, on the
                            basis of the following agenda:</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The formal negotiations have been conducted without the presence of an
                            American observer. Initial progress was fairly smooth and agreement was
                            achieved on items 1 and 2 of the agenda without undue difficulty. With
                            respect to items 3 and 4, however, increasingly serious disagreement has
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>With regard to claims, the Japanese having offered monetary settlement or
                            settlement-in-kind for vessels having Korean registry as of August 9,
                            1945 in an amount of one billion yen. The Koreans <pb xml:id="pg_1256" n="1256" facs="0200"/>have not as yet formally accepted this offer.
                            The Korean delegation has put forward a demand for the liquidated assets
                            of branch properties in Japan of former Japanese-owned corporations
                            having headquarters in Korea, on the ground that such assets were vested
                            under United States Military Government Ordinance 33 to be turned over
                            to the Korean Government. The Japanese have introduced what can be
                            considered in the nature of a counter-claim for private Japanese
                            property in Korea, which the Koreans regard as renounced by the Treaty
                            of Peace with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Formally, the claims issue turns on the construction of Article 4 of the
                            multilateral Treaty of Peace, (Tab A).<note n="4" xml:id="d564fn4">Not
                                printed.</note> Article 4 (a) provides that the disposition of
                            property and claims between Japan and authorities administering
                            renounced territories shall be the subject of special arrangements
                            between Japan and such authorities, subject, however, to paragraph 4(b).
                            By paragraph 4(b), Japan recognizes the validity of dispositions of
                            Japanese property made by or pursuant to United States Military
                            Government directives. In the Department’s opinion, the Japanese are
                            precluded from asserting claims to property in Korea, but are entitled
                            to have the loss of such property taken into account in connection with
                            the special arrangements contemplated by paragraph 4(a). Also, the
                            Department has taken the position that the property in Japan of Korean
                            corporations which were beneficially Japanese-owned was not within the
                            jurisdiction of the United States Military Government in Korea and has
                            not become the property of the Republic of Korea. Hence, with minor
                            exceptions the mutual waiver of claims would appear to be an equitable
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>The Koreans, however, have insisted upon the unilateral withdrawal of the
                            Japanese claims before proceeding further with the negotiations. By
                            letter, dated March 25, 1952, Dr. Yang requested an interpretation by
                            the Department of Article 4(b) of the Treaty, to assist the refutation
                            of Japanese claims. A reply has been prepared which supports the Korean
                            position but goes on to indicate that the loss of Japanese property in
                            Korea is relevant to the consideration of Korean claims under paragraph
                            4(a). Copies of this exchange of correspondence are attached for
                            reference (Tab B).<note n="5" xml:id="d564fn5">

                                    directives and acts of the United States Military Government in
                                    Korea all right, title and interest of Japan and of Japanese
                                    nationals in property within the jurisdiction of the Republic of
                                    Korea have been divested. Accordingly, in the opinion of the
                                    United States, valid claim to such assets or to an interest
                                    therein cannot be asserted by Japan. The disposition of such
                                    assets, which Japan has recognized as valid in Article 4(b) of
                                    the Treaty, is relevant, however, in the opinion of the United
                                    States, in the consideration of the arrangements contemplated by
                                    Article 4(a) of the Treaty.”</p>
                                <p>The note was delivered without change on Apr. 29. (See the

                                    part stated: “The Mission at Tokyo has informed us that they
                                    believe the Japanese claims are largely for bargaining purposes
                                    to counter the Korean claims and that they have, several times,
                                    informed representatives of the Japanese Foreign Office of the
                                    inadvisability of making such claims and thus exacerbating
                                    Korean-Japanese relations.” (694.95B1/4–1252)</p>

                        <p>The fisheries question has also been a matter of great contention. The
                            Korean position was initially that the so-called <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthur</persName> Line established by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, limiting the area in which Japanese
                            fishing boats could operate, should be written into the Japanese Peace
                            Treaty. The United States did not acquiesce in this request and the Line
                            has now been abolished. The Korean Government then issued a unilateral
                            declaration purporting to establish Korean jurisdiction over extensive
                            high seas areas surrounding the peninsula for fishing control
                                purposes.<note n="6" xml:id="d564fn6">The boundary of this area
                                became known as the “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                                Line”.</note> This declaration has received no support either from
                            the United States or other foreign nations.</p>
                        <p>We have urged upon both sides the desirability of negotiating a fisheries
                            agreement based upon the principle of conversation and not upon an
                            attempt to delimit high seas areas from which fishermen of either nation
                            should be excluded. In so doing, it has been pointed out that fishing
                            treaties which have recently been negotiated by the United States are
                            based upon the conservation principle. The United
                            States–Japanese-Canadian Treaty is an example. Furthermore, the Japanese
                            Government presumably would be willing to follow the conservation
                            principle in the current negotiations with Korea and, in fact, has now
                            expressed willingness for the present unilaterally to restrict fishing
                            operations of its nationals in waters of mutual Japanese-Korean concern
                            in accordance with this principle. The Japanese are also willing to
                            defer the fisheries issue for later negotiation apart from the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>In general, the negotiations on each side have been marked by suspicion
                            and by recrimination. One of the major problems is, of course, the
                            natural Korean distrust of the Japanese, and the Koreans are most
                            concerned over any claims from this powerful neighbor which they
                            consider to be extravagant. Much of this acrimony unfortunately has been
                            aired in the press or in public statements, particularly on the part of
                            Korean officials including the President, the Foreign Minister, and even
                            Dr. Yang himself, as head of the Korean delegation (Tab C).<note n="7" xml:id="d564fn7">Not found attached.</note> The effect of this has
                            been to create an <pb xml:id="pg_1258" n="1258" facs="0202"/>emotional
                            atmosphere in which it has been increasingly difficult to reach any
                            compromise solution.</p>
                        <p>Officers of the Department have on frequent occasions attempted to
                            dissuade the Korean Government through its Embassy in Washington from
                            these outbursts, but with little success. As a matter of policy, we have
                            instructed our missions in Tokyo and Pusan to use their good offices
                            informally with each side in an effort to moderate the differences which
                            have arisen and to assist in the conclusion of an equitable treaty. At
                            the same time, however, it has been considered unwise for the United
                            States to intervene openly in the negotiations, despite Korean anxiety
                            that we do so, since it is believed that if the treaty is to have
                            permanent value its terms must be arrived at through independent
                            negotiation, free from outside pressure on either Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department has recommended to our missions in both countries that
                            they suggest to the respective governments the holding in abevance of
                            the claims and fisheries issues for later negotiation, and the prompt
                            conclusion of a treaty disposing of the remaining issues, most of which
                            have now been resolved. It is important in the interests of the
                            stability of the Pacific area that Korea and Japan take this major step
                            forward in developing a sound and friendly relationship.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                        <p>In your discussion with Dr. Yang, it is recommended that:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(1) You stress the vital importance both to Korea and to the
                                stability of the Far East of the early conclusion of a treaty which
                                places Korean-Japanese relations on a sound and equitable
                                basis.</item>
                            <item>(2) You point out the necessity for a certain degree of
                                flexibility and willingness to compromise on each side, and the
                                importance of continuing the negotiations in an atmosphere of
                                greater understanding. Dr. Yang’s attention might be called in a
                                forceful manner to the great damage which intemperate statements on
                                his part and on the part of other high officials of his government
                                are causing to any prospects for the satisfactory conclusion of this
                                important treaty, and he might be informed that we are making the
                                same representations to the Japanese.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>If specific discussion arises as to methods of making progress, it might
                            be suggested to Dr. Yang in the case of the unresolved claims issue that
                            in the interests of moving ahead with the treaty each side withdraw its
                            claims to property in the territory of the other or, alternatively, that
                            negotiation on this issue be deferred to a later date. With regard to
                            fisheries, the suggestion might be made that this issue also be left for
                            further discussion outside of the framework of the present
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Yang called on me at 3:45 this afternoon to discuss the
                            progress of the negotiations between the Korean and Japanese
                            Governments, looking toward the conclusion of a treaty of friendship.
                            Ambassador Yang explained that he had just returned from representing
                            the Korean Government at these negotiations in Tokyo, and wished to
                            bring the Department up to date concerning his views on these
                            negotiations. He handed me an <hi rend="italic">Aide-Memoire</hi>, dated
                            April 29, 1952, setting forth the views of the Republic of Korea
                            concerning certain phases of the negotiations (copy attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d565fn2">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambassador briefly reviewed the course of the negotiations to date,
                            indicating that general agreement had been reached as to the status of
                            Korean residents in Japan. With regard to the settlement of the status
                            of Japanese vessels of Korean registry present in Korean waters as of
                            August 9, 1945, of which the Korean Government is asking restitution,
                            the Ambassador stated that although the Japanese had offered restitution
                            of only some 6,000 tons, his Government estimated that some 74,000 tons
                            had actually been present in Pusan alone.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador pointed out, however, that the main stumbling block
                            concerned the matter of claims, explaining that the Japanese Government
                            had put forward claims to property rights and privileges in Korea which,
                            if accepted, would virtually mean the destruction of Korean sovereignty
                            because of the size and scope of such claims. He recalled that he had
                            addressed a letter on this subject to the Department, dated March 25,
                            1952. Dr. Yang indicated that the Japanese, furthermore, were demanding
                            not only restitution <pb xml:id="pg_1260" n="1260" facs="0204"/>of such
                            property but also that it be returned in good condition, despite the
                            damage caused by the current hostilities. The Ambassador expressed his
                            belief that were it not for the introduction of these Japanese claims in
                            the recent phase of the negotiations, the other outstanding issues could
                            easily be solved and that a treaty could be signed with a minimum of
                            delay. He insisted that the Japanese claims were completely unwarranted
                            and without foundation and stated that Article 4 of the Japanese Peace
                            Treaty clearly indicated the untenable nature of such claims. Dr. Yang
                            explained that he had urged the Japanese delegation to withdraw these
                            claims and to proceed with the treaty; this they refused to do, and he
                            had therefore been forced to inform the Japanese delegation that further
                            progress on the treaty at this time appeared to be impossible.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stressed the fact that his delegation had entered the
                            negotiations in a friendly and frank spirit and had sought sincerely to
                            work out a fair basis for the conclusion of a treaty. He claimed that
                            the Japanese, however, had not responded in the same spirit and that the
                            introduction of their unreasonable property claims indicated a clear
                            lack of sincerity which largely nullified the value of further
                            negotiation with the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador went on to point out that while the Korean delegation had
                            initially treated the Japanese property claims as a matter of
                            confidence, there had been continual Japanese leaks to the press
                            concerning it and that of necessity, once made public their claims could
                            not be allowed to stand unchallenged by the Korean Government. He
                            reluctantly had felt impelled, therefore, to issue public statements in
                            refutation of them, although there were other confidential matters
                            regarding the negotiations upon which his delegation continued to
                            maintain silence.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that his Government fully appreciated the
                            importance of establishing relations with Japan upon a sound foundation,
                            since both countries are menaced by Communism and both are receiving
                            very substantial United States aid, the objective of which might be
                            vitiated were relations between the two countries allowed to
                            deteriorate. He emphasized, however, that the Korean Government was
                            helpless to proceed in the face of Japanese insistence upon their
                            clearly unfounded property claims.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized to Dr. Yang the great importance which the United States
                            attached to the establishment of firm and friendly relations between
                            Korea and Japan, and the profound influence which the character of these
                            relations would exercise over the stability of the Far East. I stated
                            that it was most unfortunate that the treaty negotiations had been
                            allowed to become the subject of public contention between the two
                            countries and urged strongly upon Dr. Yang the importance of each side’s
                            refraining from actions which would <pb xml:id="pg_1261" n="1261" facs="0205"/>tend to create an atmosphere in which further
                            negotiations would be difficult or impossible.</p>
                        <p>I then referred to Dr. Yang’s letter of March 25 concerning Japanese
                            claims and informed him that a reply had been prepared in which the
                            United States clearly took the position that, in view of the provisions
                            of the Japanese Treaty, such claims could not be sustained.<note n="3" xml:id="d565fn3">See <ref target="#d564fn5">footnote 5, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>
                                </ref>.</note> I pointed out,
                            however, that while this was the case the Department believed that the
                            Japanese claims might properly be considered as relevant in regard to
                            any special arrangements which might be worked out between the two
                            countries dealing with the disposition of property. I suggested that if
                            the claims issue could not readily be resolved in the current treaty
                            negotiations there would be great merit in undertaking discussions on
                            this matter as a separate issue, since I considered it to be most
                            important for Korea and Japan, as soon as possible, to work out a treaty
                            which would provide the basis for a full resumption of normal diplomatic
                            and other friendly relations.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the fisheries issue, I suggested that a fruitful approach
                            might be for discussions to be conducted on the basis of a conservation
                            treaty rather than upon the establishment on any arbitrary delimitation
                            of high seas areas from which one side or the other would be excluded.
                            Dr. Yang replied that the Korean delegation was prepared to discuss this
                            whole fisheries question with the Japanese in the most friendly spirit
                            and was anxious to reach a mutually satisfactory solution and that he
                            had so stated to the Japanese delegation. The approach which the Korean
                            Government had thus far favored, however, would provide a mutually
                            agreed line drawn in the straits of Tsushima to delimit areas in which
                            the boats of each nation could operate, thus avoiding the possibility of
                            direct conflict between Korean and Japanese fishermen. The Ambassador
                            did not indicate, however, that the Korean Government would insist upon
                            such a formula in any future negotiations on the fisheries question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> pointed out that
                            naturally the negotiations with the Japanese were being carried on under
                            very considerable difficulty arising from the ill feeling which had
                            inevitably resulted from 40 years of Japanese occupation of Korea. He
                            stressed that for this reason it was all the more important that a
                            treaty of friendship be concluded, at the earliest possible date, which
                            would provide for a sound foundation governing future Korean-Japanese
                            relations. He also urged upon Dr. Yang the desirability of leaving aside
                            for the moment any further discussion of the claims issue, and pointed
                            out that this matter would be susceptible of negotiation at any time <pb xml:id="pg_1262" n="1262" facs="0206"/>and should not be permitted
                            to prejudice the outcome of the present highly important negotiations;
                            in any case, the Korean position would remain strong with regard to the
                            property to which the Japanese Government was laying claim since, as a
                            practical matter, the property was in Korean hands, and, in addition,
                            the Korean Government now had the assurance of the United States that
                            under the terms of the Japanese Treaty the Japanese Government had no
                            sound legal foundation for the position which they had taken with
                            respect to this property. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> was of the opinion that an agreement to discuss
                            the matter in the future implied no commitment as to ultimate
                            disposition of this property.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that in any negotiation it was natural to assume that each
                            side would advance certain claims and counterclaims as a matter of
                            normal bargaining procedure. This did not mean, however, that either
                            side was acting in bad faith or that such claims had to be accepted. I
                            indicated my belief that the present situation might reflect such a
                            maneuver, but that this should not be allowed to disrupt the
                            negotiations on the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Yang again remarked that his attitude toward the negotiations had
                            been one of sincerity and fairness and that his delegation had
                            consistently been prepared to meet the Japanese half-way in the
                            negotiations. He still believed, however, that the Korean Government
                            could not afford to ignore the arbitrary action taken by the Japanese in
                            putting forward their unwarranted claims and that little progress could
                            be made unless these claims were withdrawn. Dr. Yang agreed, however, to
                            a suggestion that he discuss the matter further with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> and other officers of the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador thanked me for this opportunity to express, in a frank and
                            friendly fashion, the views of his Government concerning the treaty
                            negotiations with Japan.</p>

                        <p>229. For <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> eyes only. Last
                            evening at dinner Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> blandly told me that he thought the Japanese
                            could be useful as a “fifth column” in China. He said that <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName> has had three conversations with
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Generalissimo</persName> in Formosa and
                            he hoped that eventually some understanding could be developed. He <pb xml:id="pg_1263" n="1263" facs="0207"/>believed that the Chinese
                            “who are much cleverer than we Japanese” under present circumstances are
                            not averse now to the idea of a working arrangement. He thought that a
                            good many Japanese with valuable contacts on the Chinese mainland wld be
                            available for an effort in a number of regions.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister added that Japan having made so many past blunders “in
                            China and elsewhere,” having failed as a military power, shld now try
                            the role of “honest broker”. Perhaps as an intermediary, he said, Japan
                            wld enjoy better success. Whatever happened a return to militarism
                            should be avoided at all cost and with his customary chuckle “we must of
                            course remain democratic.”</p>
                        <p>I am not certain what, if any, value to attach to this voluntary
                            suggestion by Prime Minister, which wld appear however be related

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To analyze the various factors—both internal and external—which are
                            likely to determine Japan’s future foreign policy; and to assess in the
                            light of these factors Japan’s probable future orientation in the
                            East-West conflict.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. We believe that Japan will seek to achieve its national objectives by
                            a pro-Western orientation, at least during the next two or three
                            years.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe that the essential conservatism of Japanese society, the
                            strongly entrenched position of conservative political parties and
                            groups, and the weaknesses of major leftist forces, make the
                            continuation of conservative control of Japan almost certain, at least
                            through 1954. If, however, the Liberal Party should lose its present
                            majority position, divisions within the conservatives might weaken the
                            Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe that the basic national objectives of Japan will be to
                            rebuild its national strength and to enhance its position in the Far
                            East. Because of Japan’s economic and military deficiencies, <pb xml:id="pg_1265" n="1265" facs="0209"/>and because Japanese
                            conservatives share a broad identity of interest with the US in
                            containing Communist expansion, progress toward the realization of these
                            objectives will almost certainly require close cooperation with the US,
                            at least during the next two or three years. Even during this period,
                            however, Japan is likely to seek to develop at least economic relations
                            with Communist China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. The degree of Japanese cooperation with the US, in both the short and
                            long term, will depend largely on the extent to which the Western
                            alignment not only meets Japan’s needs for security and foreign trade
                            opportunities but also satisfies its expectations for economic and
                            military assistance and for treatment as a sovereign equal. Adverse
                            developments in any of these respects would increase existing pressures
                            for independent courses of action in Asia and make Japan more vulnerable
                            to Communist tactics of conciliation and threat.</p>
                        <p>5. As the most probable long-term prospect, we believe that as Japan
                            grows in strength and bargaining power, it will seek to increase its
                            freedom of action in Asia within the framework of a generally
                            pro-Western orientation. Japan will probably attempt to readjust its
                            relations with the US, seeking to eliminate the basing of US troops in
                            Japan and seeking to attain increased influence and leadership in Asian
                            affairs of joint US-Japanese concern. Japan will inevitably attempt to
                            expand economic and political relations with Communist China, and
                            probably with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, to the extent
                            possible without jeopardizing its domestic stability and will seek at
                            the same time to avoid a basic alteration in its pro-Western foreign
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>6. If, however, Japan is unable to solve its economic problems, it will
                            be particularly vulnerable to economic and diplomatic pressures from the
                            Soviet Bloc and will be tempted to seize opportunities for closer
                            economic and political relations with the Bloc. Even in this situation a
                            conservative government would seek to avoid courses of action that would
                            be likely to lead to Japan’s absorption into the Bloc. Serious internal
                            pressure in Japan would be more likely to result, at least initially, in
                            a trend toward traditional authoritarian measures rather than in the
                            rise of a pro-Communist regime.</p><gap/>

                            planned handling. I reached Ed Cronk<note n="3" xml:id="d568fn3">Chief
                                of the Japanese finance and trade section in the Office of Northeast

                            there was some division in opinion within <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> about the matter, and that he would keep us informed of
                            developments. I gather, in general, that Thayer White and some others
                            generally agree with <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s
                            view that the Japanese should be extended an invitation to join <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, but Cronk and others are not
                            convinced of the wisdom or feasibility of this course.</p>
                        <p>Personally, although heretofore we have avoided taking sides on just
                            which multilateral organization Japan should join, I can see very good
                            reasons for accepting <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s
                            view since Japanese membership in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> would presumably satisfy Japan’s desire to be
                            recognized as an important sovereign nation and, from the point of view
                            of export controls, it should result immediately in the Japanese
                            adopting the China List and moving forward with whatever progress is
                            being made in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> on charters,
                            shipping controls, etc. The alternative to an early subscription by
                            Japan to a multilateral organization would appear to be soon a more
                            substantial relaxation of Japanese controls over China trade.</p>
                        <p>I know that Barnett<note n="4" xml:id="d568fn4">Robert W. Barnett,

                            experience both with Japanese and Chinese problems, that Japan should be
                            invited to join <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_RA1">RA</gloss> has appeared as the chief resistor <pb xml:id="pg_1267" n="1267" facs="0211"/>of such a theory, on the
                            ground that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> are coming closer together as a
                            sort of European club, with Pacific partners not desired. I find this
                                <gloss target="#t_RA1">RA</gloss> view unjustified, in view of the
                            importance of such places as Singapore and Hong Kong in the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> structure, the special character of
                            Japan as the only real industrial supplier to China in the Far East, and
                            the presence in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> of Japan’s
                            principal competitors in Far Eastern trade. I see no valid geographical
                            reason for the exclusion of Japan from <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, since both that organization and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> have in the past extended membership
                            to countries which are certainly outside of the original orbit.<note n="5" xml:id="d568fn5">

                            with him last evening and suggested that I arrive half hour before
                            dinner for discussion with Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> Japanese financial situation. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> after complimentary references to
                            benefits realized by Japan result US aid and <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> policies outlined position with which Dept
                            familiar, viz., favorable aspects including foreign exchange on holdings
                            of Bank of Japan amounting roughly one billion dollars of which about
                            700 million in dollars; balanced budget “even a surplus”; slightly
                            favorable balance of trade; improved banking situation etc. However
                            adverse factors he said cannot be ignored Japanese enjoying temporary
                            benefit expenditures incident to Korea which may cease any time; lull
                            apparent in number of lines especially textiles; current favorable

                        <p>Then <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> came to point: Japan
                            needs fresh capital but more especially what govt desires is the
                            establishment of a line of credit by US. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> did not wish to state a specific amount but said
                            something from 100 million to 200 million dollars say a ceiling of 200
                            millions. I asked whether he had prepared a specific program on which an
                            application for such line of credit eld be based. He replied that
                            several programs were well advanced and based on different amounts of
                            credit 100, 200, 300 millions. He referred to conversations he has had
                            with Dr. Reed of Defense and <persName corresp="#p_DWW1">Diehl</persName> our Treasury attache along same lines. He wanted
                            Embassy’s support for his idea which he said is not limited to economic
                            considerations; he wished to point out that politically it is necessary
                            for the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> govt to have this
                            support from the US Govt in view of the elections. Therefore it is not
                            so much the question of amount of line of credit but mark of confidence
                            officials in Japanese Govt which is important. I asked whether time of
                            elections had been decided and he replied that of course <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> will decide date but he believed
                            it wld be some time next October. He wld like to urge the importance of
                            favorable US action by August if possible.</p>
                        <p>While there were a number of considerations I wanted to mention in this
                            connection I thought best to defer reference to Japanese rearmament, as
                            well as to taxes and the rest until later and after perhaps receiving
                            from Dept some indication whether there is even remote possibility
                            Japanese proposal receiving sympathetic consideration.</p>
                        <p>I made passing reference importance of Japanese efforts to stimulate
                            interest of private American capital this market and <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said that Japanese administration
                            is not obvious [oblivious?] to this important factor. I added that it
                            wld be necessary to make market attractive to private venture capital
                            and especially guarantee that capital cld be re-exported within

                            that unfortunately there is no truth in these stories. <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> is his old friend and he
                            implied their relations are good but <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName>’s physical condition resulting from stroke he
                            feared will not permit <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName>’s
                            return to active political life and the responsibilities of leadership

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p>On Friday, June 6, I talked with Theodore Tannenwald, Assistant Director
                            and Chief of Staff, Lincoln Gordon, Assistant Director for Policy and
                            Planning, and Richard N. Johnson, Assistant Director for Resources and
                            Requirements, of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s
                            office. We discussed the nature of the organization needed to deal with
                            economic and security aspects of our post-treaty relations with Japan.
                            The principal points of interest are summarized briefly below.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. There is full agreement between us that the central
                                responsibility must rest with the Department of Defense has already
                                accepted this position.</item>
                            <item>2. The <gloss target="#t_ODMS1">ODMS</gloss> people still have a
                                somewhat more grandiose conception than we do of the job to be done.
                                They believe that the big problem is to build interest on the part
                                of all other Government agencies and especially of private business
                                firms in the development of the economies of Japan and Southeast
                                Asia, and then to maintain momentum. For this task, they believe
                                that it is essential to have someone of the general experience and
                                caliber of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>, who can
                                contribute “leadership of the very highest order” and who will be
                                able to deal directly with the top levels in other agencies and in
                                business firms.</item>
                            <item>3. We agreed that Dr. Elliott’s<note n="2" xml:id="d570fn2">William Y. Elliott.</note> Interdepartmental Committee on Far
                                Eastern Mobilization should be integrated into the new
                                organizational <pb xml:id="pg_1270" n="1270" facs="0214"/>arrangement and come under the chairmanship of the Department of
                                State. Action in this connection, however, would not be taken until
                                other organizational arrangements are made.</item>
                            <item>4. The <gloss target="#t_ODMS1">ODMS</gloss> people recognize that
                                the organizational problem is essentially one for the Department of
                                State to meet and, as a matter of fact, there was some difference of
                                opinion among them. However, tentatively, they seemed to believe
                                that it might be preferable to deal with the problem on the basis of
                                a regional office of some kind within <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, thus tending to de-emphasize the purely Japanese
                                aspects. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> has under active
                                consideration the creation of a regional office and has already
                                received concurrence in principal from A.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>As the discussion proceeded, it became apparent that the <gloss target="#t_ODMS1">ODMS</gloss> people would be satisfied if the
                            Department of State hired someone like Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> as a special consultant to the Secretary for a
                            period of three to six months. Reporting to the Secretary through <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, he would assume responsibility for
                            getting the program under way and for making appropriate organizational
                            recommendations for its continuance. The Department of State can not
                            afford to do poorly with this job for any reasons within our control, so
                            we have come to the conclusion that we should accept this suggestion if
                            only to avoid future criticism that things would have gone better if we
                            had only had a man of the proper ability. As to the person, we recognize
                            the great advantage of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>’s experience. On the other hand, in Japanese eyes, he
                            is associated with particular policy lines imposed upon them by the
                            Occupation. In addition, the appointment of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> might seem to other countries in
                            Asia to be an evidence of our intention to place undue stress upon the
                            role of Japan. We would, therefore, prefer to make a strong effort to
                            find someone else of his caliber before finally settling on him.</p>
                        <p>This course of action and the proper carrying-out of the function as a
                            whole are dependent upon receipt of at least a major portion of the

                        <list>
                            <item>1. While State took the position that the United States should not
                                interfere in Japanese domestic affairs unless internal developments
                                gravely threaten United States security interests, Defense proposes
                                United States intervention “to prevent internal developments from
                                gravely threatening United States security interests.” Defense also

                            three points mentioned. United States intervention unless carefully
                            limited could have serious effects on Japanese political life,
                            Japan-United States relations, and the willingness of Japan to
                            contribute effectively to United States security objectives in the Far
                            East. Failure to take into consideration Japanese political and
                            psychological interests in the Ryukyus will keep alive a touchy issue in
                            United States–Japanese relationships. It is impossible to envisage the
                            creation of any effective security arrangement in the Pacific without
                            United States participation.</p>
                        <p>With reference to 4 (a) above, <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> can
                            accept a policy calling for the maintenance of Japanese export controls
                            as long as there is Communist aggression in the Far East and while the
                            United Nations is taking action against such action provided some
                            flexibility is permitted Japan with respect to the levels of its export
                            controls. With reference to 4 (b), <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss>
                            proposes to limit the policy statement to a provision that export
                            controls to be maintained by Japan in the post-aggression period should
                            be determined through multilateral agreement among the free nations
                            principally interested in trade with the Far East areas of the Soviet

                        <p>I am sorry that our reply is somewhat pedantic. Your telegram received
                            such wide circulation within the United States Government that it was

                            political-economic analysis of loans to Japan. My own view is that at
                            the moment the Japanese have not made either an economic or a political
                            case for loans, but that a line of credit some time in the future is not
                            altogether out of the question. I am particularly mindful of the
                            possibility that a loan for political purposes could have some harmful
                            results, as well as helpful, in connection with the coming elections. It
                            would be extremely difficult to obtain a line of credit for Japan this
                            summer. We would have, first, to show that it was politically extremely
                            important, and second, to give some respectable economic
                            justification.</p>
                        <p>It is generally conceded that loans have been made in the past for
                            political purposes, but officially the officers concerned with financial
                            policy can not afford to admit it. And, in most, if not all cases, there
                            has been genuine need. For this reason, you might want to submit some of
                            your further observations, which we are anxious to have, by letter
                            rather than by telegram or despatch.</p>

                            brought to light the general attitude of the Japanese Government on the
                            problem of the combined command under a United States commander and
                            joint United States–Japanese defense measures in the event of
                            hostilities or threatened hostilities. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and the Prime Minister agreed in principle as to
                            the necessity of establishing a combined command in the event of
                            hostilities or threat thereof, the commander of which would be
                            designated by the United States, but they were unable to make such an
                            agreement public in that it was of major political importance, would
                            sound the “death knell” of the Liberal Party, and mean certain defeat of
                            the Government in the coming general election. (See Annex for more

                        <p>The substance of the proposed agreement appears to be consistent with the
                            informal and highly confidential exchange of views between Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> recognizes the military necessity of reaching an
                            agreement in the near future with the Japanese Government on combined
                            strategic planning for the defense of Japan, and having reviewed this
                            issue in the light of other negotiations such as the status of United
                            Nations forces in Japan and present political events in Japan (the
                            coming general election and possible creation of a conservative
                            coalition government), concludes that the present time is as good as any
                            to approach the Japanese Government on this matter. However, <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> feels strongly that these conversations
                            be kept on a highly confidential and oral basis. Any hint of Japanese
                            Government concessions on this matter might mean its downfall, and would
                            be very likely to have adverse effects on US-Japanese relationships.</p>

                            the negotiation of the proposed agreement is a governmental function and
                            is not “in implementation of agreements reached”, and is, therefore,
                            within the jurisdiction of the Ambassador. It is possible that <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> bases his position on the theory
                            that the negotiation of the present agreement is in implementation of
                            Article XXIV of the Administrative Agreement which provides:</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> is of the view that such a position is
                            untenable in view of the following factors: (1) Article XXIV applies “in
                            the event of hostilities, or imminently threatened hostilities,” and (2)
                            Paragraph 1d (1) is related to the “implementation of agreements”, not
                            to the negotiation of agreements. The discussion of combined United
                            States–Japanese defense measures is of the highest governmental
                            importance and carries such great political implication that it should
                            be clearly established as a responsibility of the Ambassador to conduct
                            all discussions with the Japanese of basic policy. The determination of
                            policy is a matter for State and Defense, acting jointly. Once
                            determined, the policy should go to the Ambassador, who should be
                            responsible for reaching the basic understandings with the Japanese.
                            Obviously, this is initially a State–Defense problem. Once an
                            understanding is reached, its implementation is the province of the
                            military.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> recognizes the necessity of reaching
                            such an understanding and assuring that steps are taken at an early
                            stage to coordinate United States–Japanese defense measures. Therefore,
                                <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> would propose that agreement be
                            reached with Defense authorizing the Ambassador to approach <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> on this matter, referring to the earlier
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> understanding, and stressing the
                            highly confidential nature of the matter, and to propose that an
                            agreement or understanding be reached whereby combined planning could be
                            implemented on the technical level. Such a procedure would have the
                            merit of assuring the governmental nature of this agreement, providing
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> the opportunity of
                            discussing the political implications of the agreement with the

                            pains to explain that what he has in mind is not a formal written
                            govt-to-govt agreement regarding combined measures for US-Jap defense of
                            Jap. Both he and <persName corresp="#p_HLGDO1">Hickey</persName> state
                            their belief that under present Jap internal conditions achievement
                            formal written agreement not practicable. <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> hopes only for what he calls a verbal green light
                            from <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> on the basis of which
                            we cld go ahead and release the heavy equipment which is already here to
                            the Jap. He points to the valuable months which have already been lost
                            from the standpoint of training, organization and equipment of the Jap
                            forces. He described in rather vigorous language the extreme
                            vulnerability of our situation in Jap with forces on a slender battalion
                            basis. If the balloon shld go up tomorrow we cld not hope to make a

                            <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> has raised with me
                            question eventual repatriation approx 7,000 Jap ex-residents Bonin
                            Islands evacuated 1944 now temporarily in Japan proper. He described
                            their situation as deplorable and hoped US naval auths might soon see
                            their way to relax opposition to progressive return these refugees to
                            Bonin Islands. All they ask, he said is right to return to their own
                            homes where they can make a living and he in turn wld hope to be
                            relieved of constant flood of oral and written petitions with which he
                            is bombarded. He stated it is hard for Japs to understand US resistance
                            to reasonable desire of these people return their native heath,
                            especially in view fact that 135 former Bonin residents of Jap blood and
                            nationality but descendants of Amer and Eur settlers have already been permitted to do so. Security
                            considerations can be no greater than those concerning Okinawa and Japan
                            proper, he said, so what is reason preventing their return.</p>
                        <p>Emb finds it difficult to answer this seemingly reasonable request having
                            thus far not seen US naval auths reasons against permitting return of
                            evacuees. Unless there are important contrary considerations of which
                            Emb not aware, we cannot but feel that responsible naval auths are
                            performing grave disservice, not only to evacuees themselves but also to
                            over-all US-Jap relations, in refusing permit repatriation. In this
                            connection it shld be pointed out to Navy that this refusal is giving
                            rise to charges in Jap due to racial discrimination, territorial
                            aggrandizement and general unhumanitarian action on part of US, and
                            constitutes growing source of potential friction between US and Jap
                            Govts.</p>

                            that there is a possibility that the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss> could be induced to do something along the lines
                            of a $100 million line of credit, but success would depend largely on
                            the political importance which we could assert and on the objects of the
                            expenditures. Probably the easiest objects to justify would be the
                            financing of short-term commodity exports comparable to the cotton
                            credit. Perhaps short-term commodity credits could be combined with
                            modest long-term projects for industrial expansion or development, the
                            loans to be used for acquisition of machinery and technology in the
                            United States. The <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss> has had
                            a number of feelers on such small projects which have appeared bankable,
                            but the Japanese have not followed them up, perhaps because they prefer
                            to press more grandiose ideas. Credits of the kind just described are
                            not now needed by Japan but would be relatively harmless and in terms of
                            the actual loans are well within the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss>’s practice. The main difficulty would not be with
                            the loans themselves but with the extension of a line of credit. The
                            Board of the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss> is said to be
                            sour on this device, and would want really compelling arguments to
                            consider it seriously.</p>
                        <p>I have kept an open mind on the desirability of trying to get Japan a
                            line of credit pending full consideration of your recommendations. My
                            personal slant, however, is that we could not in the near future present
                            the kind of compelling political case that would be required. So far as
                            I can judge, there is no danger that the forthcoming elections in Japan
                            will bring into power elements hostile to the United States. I am not
                            convinced that we should take steps that are within our power to give
                            personal support to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, as
                            distinguished from other leaders representing roughly the same policies,
                            nor is it clear to me that such a gesture on the part of the United
                            States, which would be regarded as aimed at the Japanese elections,
                            would be well received in Japan, since <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> is already under attack for too-willing
                            cooperation with the United States. In addition, he has the disadvantage
                            of having been Prime Minister under the Occupation. On the whole,
                            therefore, I wonder whether any such gesture of support would have any
                            practical effect politically in Japan, and indeed whether it would have
                            beneficial propaganda or psychological results if it came at a time when
                                <pb xml:id="pg_1283" n="1283" facs="0227"/>it could be interpreted
                            simply as an attempt to shore up an unpopular government.</p>
                        <p>Unless you think that the Department can make a compelling argument that
                            a gesture is necessary to serve United States interests in Japan, I
                            think you should tell <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> that
                            it is quite unlikely the proposal could be favorably considered at this
                            time. If you do think there is compelling reason, let me have your full
                            views and I will see whether anything can be done. Meantime, do not give
                            him too much encouragement.</p>
                        <p>If you do take a completely discouraging line with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, I think you should indicate
                            that, apart from loans properly supported on a project basis, the kind
                            of United States financial assistance Japan can anticipate is assistance
                            directly connected with Japan’s rearmament. We are now discussing with
                            Defense the use of funds which are available to Defense for equipping
                            Japanese forces, and what part of such funds should be spent for
                            equipment in Japan. We are also beginning to examine the military
                            assistance to be sought for Japan as part of the United States <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 Mutual Security Program. By reason
                            of cuts made by the Congress, Defense may be under considerable pressure
                            to reduce the $300 million which has been tentatively allocated for the
                                <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> in United States <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953. You might point out to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> that such expenditures by the
                            United States can have considerable balance of payments significance for
                            Japan as well as military significance, and that the availability of
                            United States funds will depend in considerable part upon the size of
                            the forces which Japan itself is willing to establish.</p>
                        <p>In short, I am inclined to think that we should move as rapidly as
                            possible toward a consideration of assistance to Japan on our terms
                            rather than on Japanese terms, and toward the direct link between such
                            assistance and security which is required by our policy and by the views
                            of the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Please continue to keep me fully informed of your discussions with the
                            Japanese, to insure that we do not take a different line with <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName>. We will await your further
                            comments before giving you instructions on a definite reply to the

                                what our decision is to be will be most helpful to me.”

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken</persName>: I am writing in response
                            to your letter of May 19<note n="1" xml:id="d578fn1">Not printed.
                                (894.10/5–1952)</note> dealing with the subject of a possible loan
                            to Japan. The problem has received the careful consideration of officers
                            in both the Political and Economic Divisions, and the observations which
                            follow represent their combined judgment. This letter has been seen by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and has his
                            approval.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Status</p>
                        <p>For many months the Prime Minister has urgently sought a substantial loan
                            from the United States; he has discussed the matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, General Marquat, and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>. The figure given to
                            General Marquat for power development and roads amounted to nearly
                            $1,500,000,000. The Prime Minister appears to be motivated chiefly by
                            political considerations, particularly a desire to demonstrate that the
                            United States is willing to continue its support of the Japanese
                            economy. It is possible also that he believes an unrestricted loan could
                            be utilized advantageously through judicious distribution in a campaign
                            year.</p>
                        <p>More recently the Minister of Finance in separate conversations with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and the
                            Economic Counselor proposed a line of credit of $100 million and
                            indicated a willingness to engage that such a line of credit would not
                            be utilized until the dollar reserves of Japan declined to less than
                            $500 million. The Minister of Finance indicated that a line of credit of
                            the magnitude proposed would be adequate to demonstrate United States
                            support of Japan and would be of material assistance to the Liberal
                            Party in the political campaign anticipated this fall. He stated his
                            awareness of the larger request made by the Prime Minister but implied
                            that the latter would find the more modest proposal acceptable. The
                            Prime Minister has apparently instructed Ministers <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> and Tsushima to press for the extension of such a
                            line of credit.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a detailed analysis of the economic justifications for, and
                            political considerations in behalf of, loans for Japan.]</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>From the standpoint of economic considerations, it is the opinion of the
                            Embassy that a line of credit of $100 million, the activation of which
                            would be made conditional upon the size of the Japanese dollar reserves,
                            would serve to encourage the utilization of such reserves in connection
                            with a program of economic development by providing a reserve for
                            contingencies. In addition to the protection afforded by the
                            International Monetary Fund, such a line of credit would provide further
                            security and confidence in the use of the yen as a currency in
                            international trade. The proposed line of credit would also have the
                            advantage of being called into use only when needed, and creating
                            interest charges only as employed.</p>
                        <p>From the political standpoint it is certain that the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> administration believes the
                            extension of the proposed line of credit would be politically
                            advantageous to it. In all probability this advantage would accrue to
                            not only the Liberal Party in the forthcoming election, but also to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> faction in its contest
                            for control within that Party against opponents led by <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName>. Should the Liberal Party lose
                            the next election, or should the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> faction lose control of the Liberal Party, it is
                            by no means certain that the resulting Government would be so cordially
                            disposed. Since the Prime Minister is of the firm opinion that the
                            extension of the proposed line of credit would be of material
                            assistance, and since that line of credit would be employed only if
                            required and for the stabilization of the yen, the Embassy believes that
                            compliance with the Prime Minister’s request would be in the best
                            interest of the United States. The Embassy recommends, therefore, that
                            the Department should seek to obtain for Japan the requested line of
                            credit of $100 million.</p>
                        <p>If the Export-Import Bank of Washington is not favorably disposed toward
                            the extension of lines of credit, particularly for the purpose of
                            currency stabilization, it is suggested that the Department may wish to
                            explore with the Treasury Department the possibility of utilizing for
                            the purpose in question the currency stabilization fund which is under
                            the control of the Treasury and in the past has been employed for such
                            purposes. It is also possible that the Reconstruction Finance
                            Corporation could be interested in the extension of such a line of
                                credit.<note n="2" xml:id="d578fn2">
                                <p>In a memorandum of his

                                    Economic Counselor of the Embassy in Tokyo, stated in part that
                                    he had learned from both the Ambassador and from <persName corresp="#p_GH1">Herbert Gaston</persName>, Chairman of the

                                    establishment of a line of credit under which individual loans
                                    might be made to Japan. “I told the Ambassador that it had been
                                    the policy of the United States to suggest to member nations of
                                    the International Bank that they first attempt to obtain
                                    required funds from that institution and he reiterated his
                                    statement made to me on the evening of August 6 that he intended
                                    to write Governor [<hi rend="italic">President</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> requesting that an

                                    (894.10/8–1052) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> had taken up his post in June.</p>

                                    on Oct. 3. A portion of <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s memorandum of the talk reads:</p>
                                <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> then
                                    stated that the Government of Japan desired financial assistance
                                    from the United States to assist in power and road development.
                                    I replied that the International Bank for Reconstruction and
                                    Development was the proper way to take up this question, and
                                    that I was gratified that the Bank is about to send a survey
                                    team to Japan, which both Ambassadors agreed would be helpful.”

                                <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>. We have not been informed by
                            the British, French or Canadians regarding their delegations.</p>
                        <p>The British are maintaining strongly that Japan should be brought into
                            the existing CG-<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> structure and
                            stated that France and Canada concur. Moreover, the latest telegram from
                            London reported the British as having strongly desired the meeting to be
                            held in London or Paris. Previous telegrams, however, only indicated
                            that London or Washington would be preferable to our first choice,
                            Ottawa. We have reached interagency agreement on the following initial
                            proposal:</p>
                        <p>There would be a Far East Consultative Group (<gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>-CG) parallel to the existing Consultative Group, which
                            would be redesignated the European Consultative Group (E-CG) with
                            representation on the ministerial level. There would be a Far
                                East-<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> on a level equivalent
                            to the existing <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, which would be
                            redesignated the European <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. The
                                <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>-CG would deal on policy level with
                            economic security measures having an important Far Eastern aspect. The
                                <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> would deal on a working level with economic security
                            problems within a policy context determined by the <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>-CG. Both the <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>-CG and the <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> would <pb xml:id="pg_1288" n="1288" facs="0232"/>include countries having an important interest in Far
                            Eastern economic security problems, including at least Japan, the United
                            States, the United Kingdom, Canada and France. Countries would be
                            represented in the <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> by officials having special
                            competence in Far Eastern matters. The E-CG and the <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>-CG would meet together jointly as a top
                            policy group to consider security trade problems of common interest to
                            Europe and the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Coordination of the two Groups would be accomplished by an exchange of
                            information of subjects scheduled for discussion. The two Groups would
                            proceed independently to handle issues within their respective areas of
                            interest. Agreements reached in one Group would be promptly implemented;
                            the other Group would be informed of the decision reached. The two
                            Groups “will meet jointly to consider problems of common interest
                            whenever either Group <hi rend="italic">or a member of either Group</hi>
                            believes such a problem exists.”<note n="2" xml:id="d580fn2">Source of

                        <p>1. This memorandum is in response to your memorandum of 21 July 1952 in
                            which you requested the comments and recommendation of the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff with respect to the draft statement <pb xml:id="pg_1290" n="1290" facs="0234"/>of policy by the National Security Council
                            Staff on the above subject, contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/1.<note n="2" xml:id="d582fn2">See <ref target="#d579">Document 579</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur in those matters in the draft
                            statement of policy having military implications. However, they consider
                            it appropriate to submit the following comments dealing primarily with
                            the implementation of this policy.</p>
                        <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff attach the highest importance to the
                            proposed courses of action, set forth in subparagraph 7 b of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/1,<note n="3" xml:id="d582fn3">Identical to subparagraph 7b in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                125/2, <ref target="#d588">Document 588</ref>.</note> designed to
                            assist Japan in developing the military forces which will be capable of
                            assuming responsibility for defense of Japan against external aggression
                            and in developing the military capabilities for participating in the
                            defense of the free nations of the Pacific area. The early attainment of
                            these objectives will, among other things, serve the two-fold purpose
                            of:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. Largely redressing the imbalance of military power now existing
                                in the Far East; and</item>
                            <item>b. Relieving the United States of the burden of stationing large
                                military forces in and about Japan for its defense.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that the development of Japan’s
                            military potential and her continuing Western orientation will be
                            greatly influenced by the state of her economic well-being and that this
                            in turn will be significantly affected by Japan’s ability to retain
                            access to her historic markets and the sources of food and raw materials
                            in Southeast Asia. Viewed in this context, United States objectives with
                            respect to Southeast Asia and United States objectives with respect to
                            Japan would appear to be inseparably related. Moreover, the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff are of the opinion that Japan’s security and Western
                            orientation are of such importance to the United States position in the
                            Pacific area that (1) in the implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/1 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 124/2
                            (United States Objectives and Courses of Action with Respect to
                            Southeast Asia) the United States must take into full account Japan’s
                            dependence upon Southeast Asia for her economic well-being; and (2) the
                            loss of Southeast Asia to the Western World would almost inevitably
                            force Japan into an eventual accommodation with the Communist-controlled
                            areas in Asia.</p>

                            that the United Kingdom, France and Canada would not agree to the
                            establishment of a separate Far East organization. In fact, Berthoud,
                            the British representative, had very inflexible instructions on this
                                point.<note n="2" xml:id="d584fn2">In telegram 396 from London, July
                                22, the Embassy listed the following points as the basis of the
                                British position: “(1) Jap requested admission <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and if it is to be member of
                                free world request should be granted. (2) If general Far Eastern
                                trade were discussed Japan would inevitably be in position make its
                                agreement on controls subject to guarantees by free world of
                                supplies normally obtained from China. (3) While desirous have Japan
                                accept US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> standards, emphasized
                                that no controls higher than those which were generally agreed could
                                be maintained for more than a short time since maintenance would
                                result in sacrifice by one <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> of
                                trade which would be taken by another without gain in denial to
                                bloc.” (460.509/7–2252)</note> The remainder of the multilateral
                            discussions <pb xml:id="pg_1293" n="1293" facs="0237"/>were devoted to
                            an attempt to reach agreement on the establishment of a permanent
                            working group to be established by <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> on instruction from the Consultative Group. In these
                            meetings the United States attempted to obtain as much autonomy for this
                            committee as possible, while the other three Western countries attempted
                            to tie it closely to <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. Japan
                            would be invited immediately to join the Consultative Group, the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and, as a country having a
                            substantial interest in trade with China, the new China Committee.<note n="3" xml:id="d584fn3">The decision to establish this committee had
                                been taken at the five-country meeting.</note> The Japanese took
                            little part in these discussions. The recommendations of the five
                            participating countries are set forth in the attached memorandum
                            entitled “Agreed Recommendations to Member Countries of the Consultative
                                Group”.<note n="4" xml:id="d584fn4">Not printed. Its principal
                                recommendations were that Japan be invited “immediately” to join the
                                Consultative Group and the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                                and that the China Committee be set up.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The other agencies were greatly disappointed in their inability to obtain
                            a separate Far East organization and they believed it to be more
                            necessary than ever to obtain a side commitment from the Japanese to the
                            effect that Japan would continue to maintain substantially its existing
                            level of controls on trade with Communist China. In fact, Colonel
                            Moffatt received instructions from the Secretary of Defense directing
                            him to obtain such a commitment as a condition precedent to agreement to
                            something less desirable from their point of view than a separate Far
                            East organization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> had indicated in a
                            conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> on
                            July 28 that the Japanese Government assumed that the level of Japanese
                            controls would be a proper subject of discussions in the five-country
                            meeting. When they were informed that this was not a proper question for
                            discussion, they requested immediately a bilateral discussion. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> said that his
                            instructions were to discuss the level of control question in the
                            multilateral meeting and if this could not be done it would be necessary
                            to have some kind of a side understanding. The proposed discussions were
                            agreed to and have progressed amicably. Tentative agreement has been
                            reached in principle. Complete agreement depends on a mutual examination
                            of the commodities not included on the United States Security Lists to
                            determine whether they should be embargoed or be subject to the
                            administrative discretion of the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> on July 31 that because the
                            United States was not going to succeed in obtaining the agreement of the
                            other countries in a separate Far East organization and because the
                            other agencies of the United States Government believed strongly that
                            such an organization would assist in maintaining adequate <pb xml:id="pg_1294" n="1294" facs="0238"/>export controls against
                            Communist China, they were insisting upon some assurance that Far
                            Eastern controls would not be weakened. For that reason, he said, it was
                            necessary for him to have an exchange of letters with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> under which the Japanese would
                            commit themselves to (1) embargo items on the United States Security
                            Lists, (2) embargo an additional list of items found to be readily
                            determinable as of strategic importance to Communist China and (3)
                            license items suspected to be of strategic importance to Communist China
                            in return for essential commodities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> protested against giving such a commitment as
                            the price of obtaining membership in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and, it was only after intense pressure brought by
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName> and Mr. White, together with a
                            telephone call by you, that at 2:00 a.m. Friday night, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> agreed to the exchange of
                            letters (Attachment II).<note n="5" xml:id="d584fn5">The exchange of
                                letters, dated Aug. 2, did not represent final agreement, which was
                                reached on Sept. 5. See circular telegram 321, <ref target="#d599">Document 599</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> was greatly disturbed because he said that his
                            instructions were “primitive” and in doing so he was acting in large
                            degree upon his own responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> said it would be
                            extremely helpful to him if he could have “a side agreement on Hong
                            Kong”. The points included in Attachment III<note n="6" xml:id="d584fn6">Not printed.</note> were tentatively agreed to by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName> and White and accepted by the
                            United States Delegation in a meeting on Saturday morning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> wished to release to
                            the press immediately information regarding the items on which agreement
                            had been reached that Japan could relax controls. All of the members of
                            the United States Delegation thought this would be very undesirable. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> was requested to wait
                            at least a week before making the public release on this point in order
                            to avoid the implication: (1) that the Japanese Government was taking
                            action as a result of a decision reached at the five-country meeting or
                            (2) in agreement with the United States. If the impression were received
                            by the United States public and Congress, pressure might be brought on
                            the interested agencies which would cause them to take an excessively
                            restrictive position in the bilateral negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> refused, despite considerable
                            pressure, to change his press release or delay the timing of its
                            issuance. He did agree to delete two phrases which would indicate the
                            action was being taken in agreement with the United States. (See

                            export controls which Japan should adopt. State and Defense have a basic

                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> reviewed the recent
                            five-power meetings and the bilateral meetings which were held with the
                            Japanese on export controls. We were cognizant of Defense’s desire to
                            have Japan retain all export controls which it had prior to its
                            independence. We tried to move generally in that direction and were
                            successful in getting Japan to agree to control items which are on the
                            U.S. security list and to negotiate on a sizeable number of other items
                            for possible control. Three categories of matériel are affected: (a)
                            strategic materials which the Japanese would be required to embargo,
                            with occasional exceptions; (b) lesser strategic materials which would
                            be embargoed with administrative discretion; and (c) all other materials
                            which the Japanese could do as they wished. We feel that we have gone as
                            far as we can with the Japanese and the remaining items involved must be
                            left up to bilateral negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> pointed out that the Defense Department will not
                            accept this position because they feel that this position would control
                            fewer items than were formerly controlled. We feel that it is hopeless
                            to go back to this former control listing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> pointed out that if we attempt
                            to obtain a more rigid listing of materials, undoubtedly the Japanese
                            would appeal to the British and French, which, of course, would involve
                            us in other problems which we hope to avoid at the present time.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1296" n="1296" facs="0240"/>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEW1">Martin</persName> pointed out that if
                            we get a longer list it would create problems when Japan becomes a
                            member of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, because at that time
                            Japan will see the less rigid listing of materials which affect the
                            Europeans. Also, they will see how this operation is used to subsidize
                            certain aspects of the European economy and the Japanese may ask for
                            some assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> felt
                            that we had been extremely successful in our negotiations with the
                            Japanese, especially in view of the fact that the Japanese accepted a
                            far more extensive listing than any of our European allies have
                            accepted. He asked for a memorandum on this subject.</p><gap/>

                        <p>The Department in preparing the analysis of the problem with respect to
                            Japan considered, in the light of United States security interests, the
                            three possible positions that Japan might assume in the future in the
                            Pacific area: (1) a Japan with little or no military power, dependent
                            upon the United States for defense; (2) a resurgent Japan, rearmed,
                            dominant in the Far East and not allied with the United States; (3) a
                            Japan restored to a position of power, capable of securing its own
                            defenses and of contributing to the security and economic stability of
                            the free countries of the Far East, and allied with the United States.
                            The first course of action was ruled out as impractical. The second was
                            ruled out as potentially dangerous, <pb xml:id="pg_1298" n="1298" facs="0242"/>and prejudicial to the security of the Far East and
                            United States relations with other nations in the area, in view of the
                            possibility that Japan might try to take advantage of the United
                                States-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> conflict in an
                            effort to restore its influence on the continent of Asia and might
                            conclude that accommodation with Communist-controlled areas in Asia
                            would best serve Japanese interests. Recognizing an initial identity of
                            interests between the United States and Japan, the continuing threat of
                            Soviet and Chinese Communist power in the Far East, Japan’s power
                            potential, Japan’s relationship with the other countries of Asia, the
                            internal situation in Japan, and certain natural limitations on the
                            development of military power by Japan, it was felt desirable to develop
                            courses of action whereby Japan would be assisted in the development of
                            its armed forces, enabling it to secure its own defense and to
                            contribute to the security and economic stability of the free countries
                            of the Far East in alignment with the United States. Because of Japan’s
                            dependence upon the countries of Southeast Asia for raw materials and
                            markets, it was believed that Japan should be encouraged to participate
                            in the economic development of the free nations of the Pacific on the
                            understanding that Japan did not become a dominating influence in the
                            area prejudicial to the independence and security of these nations. It
                            was also recognized that an identity of interests between the United
                            States and Japan could best be retained were the principle and practice
                            of representative government strengthened in Japan and were the United
                            States to respect Japan’s status as a sovereign independent state and to
                            recognize Japan’s legitimate economic needs.</p>

                            policy objectives with respect to <pb xml:id="pg_1299" n="1299" facs="0243"/>Japanese export controls on trade with communist China.

                        </p>
                        <p>The substantive difference between the two Departments is this: Defense
                            wants us to continue to put pressure on Japan to maintain substantially
                            intact the complete embargo on all exports to communist China, including
                            exports of non-strategic goods, which was instituted during the period
                            of the Occupation. The Department believed our policy aim should be to
                            limit the embargo to strategic items and that the Japanese should be
                            permitted to relax controls on the export to China of non-strategic
                            goods. There are several reasons why we feel the Defense version should
                            be strongly opposed:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. We have within the last two weeks reached an understanding with
                                the Japanese, which has been set out in an exchange of notes,<note n="2" xml:id="d587fn2">See <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s memorandum to
                                        <persName>Johnson</persName>, <ref target="#d584">Document
                                        584</ref>.</note> that they will embargo all items on the
                                United States security lists plus such other items as we and Japan
                                agree should be embargoed on strategic grounds. This is a higher
                                level of control than that exercised by any country other than the
                                United States. This understanding implicitly provides leeway for the
                                export of non-strategic goods. If we now put pressure on Japan to
                                embargo all items (using as a sanction for this purpose our own
                                controls on exports to Japan) American good faith in entering into
                                this agreement will be brought into question.</item>
                            <item>2. Defense and Commerce recognize through familiarity with recent
                                negotiations that with Japan’s present sovereignty there is no
                                practical hope of obtaining agreement on embargo of items of other
                                than strategic value. This is substantially more than the Japanese
                                expected to give—having arrived here with the notion that they would
                                not accept more than the level of controls agreed
                                multilaterally.</item>
                            <item>3. Some degree of trade between Japan and China is essential to
                                the economic viability of Japan, which is set forth as an objective
                                of United States policy elsewhere in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/1. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                                recognizes the economic well-being of Japan will greatly influence
                                her military capabilities.</item>
                            <item>4. A rigid embargo on all Japanese exports to China will intensify
                                Japanese competition in free-world markets and make more difficult
                                our efforts to bring Japan back into the free-world trade community.
                                Fear of vigorous Japanese competition has led the British, the
                                Australians, the Canadians and others to oppose our policy of
                                promoting fair and equitable treatment of Japanese trade. If we
                                cannot develop reasonable trading outlets for Japanese exports, both
                                in communist China and elsewhere, we may well be faced with demands
                                from Japan for some kind of foreign aid for which Congress is not
                                prepared.</item>
                            <item>5. The Defense policy objective would get us into a situation of
                                constant haggling with the Japanese Government over the embargo <pb xml:id="pg_1300" n="1300" facs="0244"/>of particular items, with
                                the United States threatening at each stage to clamp down on United
                                States exports to Japan. We know from past experience that this sort
                                of relationship would become a source of serious irritation and
                                would adversely affect the achievement of other objectives in our
                                relations with the Japanese. In the case of Japan this kind of
                                pressure would produce a special political hostility to the United
                                States because it would be claimed by many Japanese that the United
                                States was attempting to continue its dominance over Japan in the

                            <item>6. There is no substantial security objective to be served by
                                maintaining an embargo on exports to China of non-strategic items.
                                The sole purpose of a complete embargo, such as the United States
                                applies, is one of moral condemnation. In the case of Japan the
                                importance of this end is far outweighed by the other economic and
                                political factors mentioned above.</item>

                            States Objectives and Courses of Action With Respect to Japan</p>
                        <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Estimates</p>
                        <p>The United States should proceed in its determination of policy with
                            respect to Japan on the basis of the following estimates:</p>
                        <p>a. Japan will maintain a close alignment with the United States at least
                            through 1954.</p>
                        <p>b. Japan’s basic national objectives will be to rebuild its national
                            strength and to enhance its position in the Far East. The most probable
                            long-term prospect is that Japan will seek to increase its <pb xml:id="pg_1302" n="1302" facs="0246"/>freedom of action in Asia
                            within the framework of a generally pro-Western orientation.</p>
                        <p>c. Japan will take all feasible military measures to defend its territory
                            from attack and the United States and Japan will develop combined
                            measures to maintain Japan’s security.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. United States security interests in the
                            Pacific area</p>
                        <p>a. The security of Japan<note n="*" xml:id="d588fn5">Japan is a part of
                                the off-shore U.S. defense line which also includes the Ryukyus, the
                                Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> is of such importance to the United States position in
                            the Pacific area that the United States would fight to prevent hostile
                            forces from gaining control of any part of the territory of Japan.</p>
                        <p>b. It is in the interest of the United States to assist Japan rapidly to
                            develop (1) the means for its own defense, thereby relieving the United
                            States of sole responsibility for Japan’s security, and thereafter (2)
                            the capability to contribute to the defense of other free nations of the
                            Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>c. The United States should encourage and assist Japan to rearm itself
                            with conventional weapons. It is important for United States security
                            interests that this policy be related, in terms of timing and nature of
                            assistance, to such factors as the political situation in the Far East,
                            the internal situation in Japan, relations between Japan and other Far
                            Eastern countries, and to the ways in which the United States desires to
                            influence these situations and relations.</p>
                        <p>d. The United States security interests will require long-term retention
                            of bases in the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands in view of the eventual
                            possibility that future Japanese governments may severely restrict or
                            exclude United States use of military facilities in Japan proper.
                            Extremely careful preparation, including consultation with the Japanese
                            Government and efforts to influence Japanese public opinion, will be
                            required on whatever long-term arrangements the United States decides to
                            put into effect regarding the Ryukyus to prevent this from becoming such
                            an acute issue in Japanese domestic political affairs as to affect
                            Japan’s relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>e. For the foreseeable future it will be in the interest of the United
                            States to maintain adequate armed forces in the Pacific area and to
                            encourage appropriate arrangements in the Far East which would
                            strengthen the security of Japan, the Ryukyus, and other areas vital to
                            U.S. defense.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. The power position in the Pacific area</p>
                        <p>a. The military capability of Soviet and Chinese Communist forces in the
                            Far East presents a major threat to Japan and to the <pb xml:id="pg_1303" n="1303" facs="0247"/>security of the United States
                            in the Pacific area. A sovereign Japan faces a power complex in which
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the United States each
                            possesses military potential far superior to that of Japan. However, it
                            is probable that Japan will in time develop sufficient power to become a
                            major element in Far Eastern affairs.</p>
                        <p>b. For at least the immediate future Japan will be aligned with the
                            United States and largely dependent upon the United States for security
                            from external attack and for economic stability. It is in the interest
                            of the United States that Japan rapidly develop the capability for
                            self-defense and that, in the face of Soviet and Chinese Communist power
                            in the Far East, Japan’s military strength be developed to the extent
                            that it can contribute significantly to the security of the free nations
                            of the Pacific area and of the northern portion of the off-shore island
                            chain.</p>
                        <p>c. Japan will increasingly seek to achieve an independent role in Far
                            Eastern affairs. Japan’s flexibility of maneuver and freedom of choice
                            will increase as Japan develops the capability for self-defense and
                            economic and military self-support. In this situation Japan’s policies
                            and actions will be determined on the basis of Japan’s conception of
                            self-interest, and this conception may come into conflict with the
                            interests of the United States.</p>
                        <p>d. Japan may try to take advantage of the United States-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> conflict; desiring to restore
                            Japanese influence on the continent of Asia and to regain the advantages
                            of China trade, Japan might conclude that an accommodation with
                            Communist-controlled areas in Asia would serve Japanese interests. The
                            extent and nature of this “accommodation” would be conditioned by
                            Japan’s ability to satisfy its economic needs through relations with the
                            free world and her international undertakings in the field of export
                            controls.</p>
                        <p>e. The continuance of Japan’s alignment with the United States will
                            depend in large degree upon maintenance by the United States of a strong
                            military posture in the Pacific and the pursuance of policies by the
                            United States and other free nations which encourage the growth in Japan
                            of basic economic strength and the close participation by Japan with the
                            United States in developing satisfactory security relationships among
                            all the non-Communist countries of the Pacific area and satisfactory
                            economic relationships both among them and between them and other parts
                            of the free world. It is also possible, however, that even without an
                            accommodation with Communist influence in Asia, the Japanese will
                            attempt to build up a paramount position of influence in the Far East to
                            the detriment of the independence of the other free nations of the Far
                            East and contrary to the interests of the United States.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. The relationship between Japan and the United
                            States</p>
                        <p>a. For the time being the security interests of Japan and the United
                            States in the Pacific area are generally parallel. The United States
                            should act in such a way that this mutuality of interest, which is
                            necessary to effective cooperation, is maintained and that Japan is
                            convinced of its reality. The achievement of this result will require,
                            among other things, maintenance of a strong United States power position
                            in the Pacific, respect for Japan’s status as a sovereign independent
                            state, and the development and implementation of policies designed to
                            accord Japan opportunities for the satisfaction of legitimate economic
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>b. It should be the policy of the United States to encourage the
                            development and strengthening by Japan of the principles and practices
                            of representative government. It is in the interest of the United States
                            to avoid actions which would have the effect of undermining the
                            stability and popular position of the responsible pro-Western political
                            forces in Japan. The United States should not interfere in Japanese
                            domestic affairs except to carry out Article I of the United
                            States–Japan Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Japan’s Position in the Pacific</p>
                        <p>a. A strong, stable and independent Japan restored to an influential
                            position in Asia could be the most effective ally of the United States
                            in Asia, provided Japan’s independent position is directed in the
                            interest of the free world and does not lead to a growing isolation from
                            the West, either in an attempt to play off the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the United States or to dominate the other
                            countries of Asia. South and Southeast Asia would probably accept the
                            restoration of Japan to a position of power in order to contain the
                            Communist bloc, as long as there is a balanced distribution of power in
                            the region so that Japan does not become a dominating influence.</p>
                        <p>b. In the long run, Japan’s access to raw materials and markets for her
                            exports will significantly affect Japan’s basic orientation. At present
                            Japan has a comfortable foreign exchange reserve position and may expect
                            sizeable dollar earnings from military expenditures for at least two
                            years. Over the longer term, however, Japan’s position requires that
                            every effort be made to expand Japan’s earnings from normal commerce and
                            from programs of U.S. military and economic assistance to other
                            countries, with a view to avoiding, if possible any requirement for
                            direct economic assistance; at the same time should these measures prove
                            inadequate, consideration should also be given to the provision of
                            direct economic assistance when and if necessary.</p>
                        <p>c. United States policy should aim to encourage Japanese participation in
                            the economic development of the free nations of the Pacific. <pb xml:id="pg_1305" n="1305" facs="0249"/>Satisfactory economic
                            arrangements between Japan and South and Southeast Asia will strengthen
                            these areas against Communist exploitation.</p>
                        <p>d. In the relations between Japan and the other nations of Asia, the
                            United States should not appear as a sponsor or advocate of Japan as
                            against any of the other free nations. The United States should resist
                            any design by Japan to serve as a broker between the United States and
                            Asia or to restrict the United States position in Asia. However, the
                            United States should seek to facilitate the difficult adjustments
                            arising from Japan’s return to the international community through the
                            exercise of the U.S. position of leadership among the nations of the
                            Pacific area and as a moderating or, if necessary, mediating
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>e. As a long term policy, the United States should encourage and where
                            desirable participate in collective security arrangements in the Pacific
                            area which would include Japan as an important member. Such arrangements
                            would facilitate Japan’s contribution to the security and economy of the
                            free nations of the area, would encourage Japan’s adherence to the free
                            world, and would tend to allay fears among Pacific nations of a
                            resurgence of Japanese ambition to dominate Asia.</p>

                        <p>6. In accordance with the general considerations above, the United States

                                1396.</note> at which time he informed the representatives of these
                            governments, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, France and the
                            Philippines, of the United States plan to bring personnel of the
                            National Police Reserve to American bases in Japan on a rotation basis
                            for basic training in the use of heavy military equipment under direct
                            American supervision, and the plan to permit Japanese crews to operate
                            Coastal Patrol craft under American control. At that time none of these
                            governments had any objections. The time has now come, I stated, to move
                            into the next phase of this limited rearmament program in order to make
                            it possible for the Japanese to use light naval and heavy ground force
                            equipment themselves. I summarized the legislation authorizing the loan
                            of 18 <gloss target="#t_PF1">PF</gloss>’s and 50 <gloss target="#t_LSSL1">LSSL</gloss>’s to Japan<note n="2" xml:id="d589fn2">

                            </note> and informed
                            the above representatives that this program is now being implemented.
                            They had all read of it and believed their governments had the necessary
                            details. Mr. Wade inquired as to whether or not these vessels were in
                            addition to the ships referred to in the conversations of last November.
                            I informed him that these were not in addition but constituted the total
                            number of naval craft which the United States is now in the process of
                            loaning to the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>As to the loan of heavy equipment to the Police Reserve, I explained that
                            the United States Government has no statutory authority to undertake a
                            grant aid program in Japan. Therefore, the President has decided to make
                            a loan of such equipment to the Japanese <pb xml:id="pg_1310" n="1310" facs="0254"/>Government as a temporary measure. I informed them that
                            the total number of heavy guns and light tanks would be approximately
                            500 of both categories. I emphasized at the same time that the total
                            number of such heavy equipment would not be turned over <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> to the Japanese Government but rather
                            would be loaned gradually in small lots. I pointed out that the Japanese
                            Police Reserve is still far from organized on a divisional basis and
                            that much training was necessary. I explained that the system of
                            training at American bases had worked satisfactorily as far as it went
                            but that it left much to be desired in developing Japanese defensive
                            capabilities since it prevented artillery and tank units from training
                            on a coordinated basis with the infantry.</p>
                        <p>The reason for the decision to make direct loans to the Japanese, I said,
                            was to build up Japan’s capacity for self-defense in view of the
                            increasingly hostile and threatening security situation in the Far East.
                            The United States Government views this loan as a logical development in
                            the normal course of implementing the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty which
                            provides that Japan will increasingly assume responsibility for its own
                            defense against aggression.</p>
                        <p>I took particular pains to point out that the United States Government
                            would make no public announcement of this loan of heavy equipment and
                            would attempt to limit publicity on it in Japan and in the United States
                            to the greatest extent possible within the powers of this government. I
                            also noted that the loan of this heavy equipment eventually would reach
                            public attention at which time the United States would say as little as
                            possible but explain that such loan was a normal implementation of the
                            U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and that it was relatively small in size. Mr.
                            Campbell strongly approved of this course of action on public
                            information aspects. Mr. McNicol and Mr. Wade each indicated that the
                            less publicity the better from the point of view of their own
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>I also indicated to these four representatives that the Department of
                            State was fully aware of the repercussions which this loan of heavy
                            equipment might have in other countries of the Pacific and Far East when
                            it became public knowledge, and that we hoped that the governments and
                            peoples of friendly countries of this area would understand the urgent
                            necessity for this limited program. I mentioned that there are many
                            limitations on Japan’s ability to rearm—so many that in the view of the
                            United States, Japan cannot become an aggressive threat to any nation in
                            the Far East. On the contrary, the United States Government is concerned
                            lest Japan’s military weakness provoke aggression or create conditions
                            of instability.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wade acknowledged the logic of this position but pointed out that in
                            New Zealand people are still apprehensive of any resurgence <pb xml:id="pg_1311" n="1311" facs="0255"/>of militarism in Japan. They
                            wish to be assured that Japan’s growing military power will be under
                            control. Mr. McNicol forcefully bespoke the fears and apprehensions of
                            the Australian people in this respect.</p>
                        <p>I informed Mr. McNicol and Mr. Wade that this subject probably would be
                            mentioned at the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> meeting in
                            Honolulu, although I did not know whether the matter would be discussed
                            in any detail.</p>
                        <p>All four representatives expressed appreciation for the Department of
                            State’s consideration in informing their respective governments
                            confidentially and in advance regarding this matter. Mr. McNicol
                            emphasized the desirability of such consultation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TFS1">Tomlinson</persName> told me that it would be of
                            great help to his government in combatting adverse public opinion in
                            various parts of the world with respect to Japanese rearmament if the
                            United States Government would provide the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> with as much information on the expected development
                            of Japanese defense forces as possible. Shortly after the conversations
                            in mid-November with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TFS1">Tomlinson</persName> took up this point
                            with him on instructions from London.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">John</persName>: At the invitation of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>, I accompanied him
                            on a visit to Okinawa July 24–25. We visited most of the military, air,
                            and naval installations and I had the opportunity as well for an
                            informative meeting, arranged by Vice Consul Thomas H. Murfin, with the
                            leading Ryukyuan officials. We had the benefit of <pb xml:id="pg_1312" n="1312" facs="0256"/>thorough briefings, especially an instructive
                            one by the Civil Administrator, General <persName corresp="#p_LGJM1">Lewis</persName>, and his staff. I had opportunity for discussions
                            with Generals <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>,
                                Beightler,<note n="1" xml:id="d591fn1">Maj. Gen. Robert S.
                                Beightler, Deputy Governor of the Ryukyu Islands.</note> Stearley,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_LGJM1">Lewis</persName> regarding their
                            attitudes on the question of returning the Ryukyus, or part of them, to
                            Japanese administration. I found that General Stearley, Commanding, 20th
                            Air Force, was the least sympathetic in this regard although his
                            interest relates primarily only to Okinawa and a few other islands of
                            direct interest to the Air Force. For the rest, our military, and this
                            is especially true of General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_LGJM1">Lewis</persName>, Civil Administrator, there is an eagerness to see
                            Amami Oshima and other islands north of the 27th parallel returned to
                            Japanese administration. I know that if the question were put officially
                            to General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> as
                            Commander-in-Chief, he would concur in a decision to return at least
                            some of these islands to Japanese administration. In fact he is eager to
                            do so.</p>
                        <p>What has surprised me since my arrival in Japan is the absence of public
                            agitation on the subject. I have never been approached by people like
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>, or any one else
                            in the Japanese Government with a plea for the return of the Ryukyus to
                            Japanese administration. The Embassy receives an occasional letter or
                            petition, usually from private individuals or interested organizations.
                            Perhaps the Japanese feel that it would be simply a waste of time on
                            their part, or perhaps now that the issue of ultimate sovereignty is no
                            longer at stake they have simply lost interest in the lesser question of
                            administrative control, but the fact remains they have not raised the
                            question urgently. In the Ryukyu Islands, however, the issue is still
                            being stressed by editorials and press comment, public demonstrations,
                            especially in the northern islands, inclusion in party platforms, and in
                            resolutions by the legislature. On the other hand, the Japanese Foreign
                            Minister has urged and continues to urge the return of former Japanese
                            residents to the Bonin Islands.</p>
                        <p>My conclusion is that we should keep this matter on ice temporarily with
                            a view to pressing for the return to Japanese administration of some or
                            all of the islands north of the 27th parallel (i.e., roughly those which
                            used to form part of Kagoshima Prefecture) at a time when a political
                            gesture of this sort on our part would be profitable. We may be faced
                            during the coming months with difficulties, and at such time a gesture
                            could be most beneficial. In all of this I am assuming that the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff would not go whole hog and I am not recommending by any
                            means that we return Okinawa itself, for example, to Japanese
                            administration, at least for the immediate future. Here I believe the
                            Air Force will be <pb xml:id="pg_1313" n="1313" facs="0257"/>adamant
                            and, when the entire strategic position of these islands is considered,
                            I am in no position to say that the Air Force is wrong. Okinawa is vital
                            to us and we should take our time in consideration of this question.
                            This is particularly true as we are presently under no compelling
                            pressure from the Japanese to return the islands. If such pressure
                            develops later it may be at a time when the general strategic situation
                            may have changed. We are making a tremendous investment in Okinawa in
                            the form of permanent improvements and installations.</p>
                        <p>These are my rough views on the subject and I would appreciate, at some
                            convenient time, the benefit of the Department’s current thinking.</p>
                        <p>With warm regards and best wishes, I am</p>

                                dated Aug. 11, the Department inquired concerning a speech delivered
                                by <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> before members of
                                the <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> on Aug. 4, in which the
                                Prime Minister had spoken of preparing voters for the announcement
                                of the transfer of heavy weapons to it. The telegram concluded: “In
                                view inconsistency with substance Tokyo’s 407, Dept requests ur
                                views.” (794.5/8–1152) For a résumé of telegram 407, July 30, see

                            Department’s point well taken regarding inconsistency between Japanese
                            Government’s expressed hope that there would be as little advance
                            publicity as possible attached to loan heavy equipment for use <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s August 4 declaration. However inconsistency
                            apparent rather than real.</p>
                        <p>I lunched with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> last
                            Thursday and he brought up matter explaining with obvious embarrassment
                            that his declaration was not intended for publication. He said he had
                            intended only to make confidential explanation to <gloss target="#t_NPR1">NPR</gloss> representatives so that they would
                            understand his policy. Publication resulted, he said, from scoop by
                            unauthorized reporter for which <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> apologized.</p>
                        <p>Thus far reaction to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            statement has been mild. As it is planned by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> to commence release of heavy equipment on 15 August, it
                            is hoped that no contretemps will intervene to delay program. Once
                            program is launched it will of course be impossible to <pb xml:id="pg_1314" n="1314" facs="0258"/>avoid some publicity but this
                            should develop gradually and after program under way.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> expressed the best
                            wishes of his Government to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName>, and indicated that he was very happy to have the
                            opportunity to meet with him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> discussed their mutual
                            interest in banking. The Ambassador noted that on two occasions in his
                            banking career, from 1923–1926 and 1935–1937, he was in New York with
                            the Bank of Japan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> mentioned that from the reports appearing in the
                            press, Japan’s current financial situation is quite satisfactory. The
                            Ambassador replied that this is correct since the present dollar balance
                            of Japan is at a high level. However, he did not feel that this
                            accurately reflects the Japanese economic situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> outlined the current source of
                            dollar earnings in Japan, including large US purchases in Japan as a
                            result of the Korean operation, and expenditures of US soldiers—which he
                            indicated amounted to at least $100,000,000 last year. Concerning
                            Japanese exports, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> stated
                            that Japan exported approximately 300 million dollars in goods and
                            services to the United States during the last year, and US imports
                            amounted to approximately 1,100 million dollars. He stated this deficit
                            is of definite concern to Japan because the US military procurement in
                            Japan and expenditures of US troops is of a temporary nature.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> mentioned that
                            the loss of sources of supply of materials and markets on the mainland
                            of China must also be of some concern to Japan since this means that
                            alternate sources of supply and markets must be found. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> stated that this is
                            correct, and that Japan has been and must continue to find <pb xml:id="pg_1315" n="1315" facs="0259"/>[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]
                            such alternate markets and sources of supply, mainly in Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> asked about the
                            extent of Communist infiltration in Japan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> stated that this is a serious
                            problem in Japan, and that steps are being taken to curb Communist
                            infiltration, particularly in Japanese youth groups. He also mentioned
                            that unemployment of any nature would be serious in Japan since the
                            Communists would immediately exploit it to the disadvantage of the
                            Japanese Government. He stated, however, that he feels the Japanese
                            Government is dealing and will continue to deal effectively with the
                            Japanese Communist movement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> mentioned that the Japanese National Police
                            Reserve should be of considerable assistance in dealing with any
                            internal Communist disturbances. The Secretary noted that the <gloss target="#t_JNPR1">JNPR</gloss> is currently being built up to a
                            four-division force, and it is expected that 6 divisions will be
                            established by 1954, and ten divisions by 1956. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> agreed, saying that this
                            “military” force should provide a substantial measure of security for
                            Japan. The Secretary mentioned that the combined US sea, air, and ground
                            forces in Japan, together with the Japanese forces, would make it
                            expensive if not foolhardy for any aggression against Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> mentioned that
                            Soviet intentions in the Far East are such that they point a dagger at
                            the heart of Japan, and this is one of the reasons we must not permit
                            Korea to fall to the Communists. In this connection Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> mentioned that he is not
                            particularly hopeful of a truce in Korea since, if the Communists
                            desired an armistice, they could have had one a year ago, and could have
                            one today on reasonable terms. He mentioned that we must continue the
                            struggle in Korea until we obtain a reasonable settlement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName> mentioned that
                            the North Koreans are a particularly primitive and barbaric type of
                            people, and he asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> whether Japan had difficulties with the North
                            Koreans when they held Korea. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> replied in the affirmative, indicating that all
                            Koreans are the same. However, the North Koreans are particularly
                            difficult. He stated that at the time Japan was having difficulties on
                            the Manchurian border they also had a rather difficult time with the
                            North Koreans. He pointed out that North Korea has a tradition of
                            invasion of South Korea. He attributed this to the Manchurian influence
                            on the North Korean population.</p>
                        <p>It was mentioned that there are fairly large numbers of Koreans in Japan
                            that are causing the Japanese Government some difficulty because of
                            their relationship to the Communist organization in Japan. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> stated that of the
                            approximately 600,000 <pb xml:id="pg_1316" n="1316" facs="0260"/>Koreans
                            presently in Japan, a very large number are associated with the
                            Communist movement. He stated that the Japanese Government plans to
                            discuss this matter with the Korean Government at the forthcoming
                            negotiations in an effort to repatriate the Koreans.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> thanked the
                            Secretary for the interview and stated that he hoped to have the
                            opportunity to meet him again.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded at 1540.</p>
                        <p>Following the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName> escorted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> on a brief tour of the Pentagon.</p>

                        <p>The questions raised in your letter have been reviewed by the Department

                            that the policy which guides the Department of Defense in the matter of
                            repatriation of the Japanese to the Bonin Islands was established by the
                            State-War–Navy Coordinating Committee in action <gloss target="#t_SWNCC1">SWNCC</gloss> 214/2, dated 23 November 1945,

                            <item>“The Joint Chiefs of Staff should be requested to advise the

                        </list>
                        <p>In a further action on 26 March 1946 the <gloss target="#t_SWNCC1">SWNCC</gloss> approved the following:</p>

                        <list>
                            <item>“a. The specific request for the return of the natives of the
                                Bonin Islands, who are of British and American descent and who were
                                forcibly moved by the Japanese to Japan, should be approved.</item>
                            <item>“b. As a general policy former inhabitants of American and

                        </list>
                        <p>It is the viewpoint of this office that the repatriation of the former
                            Bonin Island residents of British and American descent did not revise
                            the policy of the Coordinating Committee with respect to repatriation of
                            Japanese to the Bonin Islands.</p>
                        <p>There are several considerations concerning repatriation of Japanese to
                            the Islands which have been submitted to this office by the Department
                            of the Navy, and are forwarded herewith for your information:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) A 1940 Japanese Government census indicated that over 90% of
                                the population of the Bonin and Volcano Islands were concentrated on
                                the three main islands of Chi Chi Jima, Ha Ha Jima, and Iwo Jima.
                                These three islands comprise 52 square miles of a total land area of
                                65 square miles for all 28 islands. Additionally, these three
                                islands now contain naval facilities which are important to our Far
                                East defenses and the influx of so many persons to these islands
                                would have an effect which has yet to be determined.</item>
                            <item>(b) In 1940 the population was 6207 rather than 7000 indicated as
                                now desiring to return. Of these some 40% were engaged in farming
                                and fishing. Most of the remainder were engaged in construction of
                                fortifications and other military facilities.</item>
                            <item>(c) A review of the land titles of the Bonin Islands indicates
                                that approximately 78% of all Bonin lands were owned by the Japanese
                                Government. Therefore, there is but little land to which these
                                people could lay a legal claim. Now that Japan is again a sovereign
                                nation, and the United States has indicated that Japan has <hi rend="italic">some</hi> residual sovereignty in the islands,
                                disposition by the Navy of that land to which Japan might assert
                                claim is at least open to question. The islands of Chi Chi Jima and
                                Ha Ha Jima which contained most of the population were primarily
                                military bases and the majority of the civilian population were
                                there solely because of this fact.</item>
                            <item>(d) In 1944, the Japanese Government evacuated all civilians from
                                the Bonin and Volcano Islands, and now, as a result of the war, all
                                traces of former villages have disappeared and there are no homes to
                                which these people could return. To bring back some seven thousand
                                persons would create a tremendous resettlement problem and would
                                entail considerable expense not only for reconstruction and
                                rehabilitation but also for normal day-to-day living until they
                                could establish themselves.</item>
                            <item>(e) The return of so many Japanese citizens to an area not under
                                control of Japan would create administrative difficulties, including
                                questions of criminal jurisdiction, and by their very numbers would
                                tend to prejudge a later decision on the eventual disposition of the
                                islands—a decision which is not desirable to make at this time. In
                                this connection the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded on 22 [<hi rend="italic">21</hi>] January 1952 that the current U.S. policy
                                with respect to the Nansei <pb xml:id="pg_1318" n="1318" facs="0262"/>Shoto, Nanpo Shoto, (which includes the Bonin and Volcano
                                Islands), Marcus Island, and Parece Vela is sound, and no change in
                                U.S. policy in regard to these islands should be contemplated until
                                a condition of stability has been firmly established throughout the
                                Far East.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing it is the viewpoint of this office that it is
                            not in the best interest of the U.S. Government to revise the present
                            policy with respect to repatriation of Japanese to the Bonin
                            Islands.</p>

                            in the Ryukyus and Bonin-Volcano Islands in the post-Treaty period. A
                            copy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff memorandum is attached for your
                            information. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum is the
                            result of questions raised by representatives of the Department of State
                            at an informal discussion with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>It is the viewpoint of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after considering
                            possible courses of action in connection with the disposition of the
                            Ryukyus and Bonin-Volcano Islands, that there should be no change in the
                            status of the islands “until such time as the politico-military
                            situation in the Far East becomes stabilized in a way favorable to U.S.
                            security interests.” I fully concur in this view.</p>

                        <p>1. During a recent informal discussion between representatives of the
                            Department of State and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the question was
                            raised by the Department of State representatives as to the
                            advisability, from a political standpoint, of the United States
                            signifying its intention to return some or all of the Ryukyu and Bonin
                            Islands to Japan, possibly retaining only Okinawa under United Nations
                            trusteeship. After some discussion, it was agreed that representatives
                            from the Department of State and the Joint Chiefs of Staff should meet
                            to analyze the problem and submit recommendations as to the future
                            disposition of the islands in question.</p>
                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have repeatedly held that strategic control
                            of the Nansei Shoto south of 29° N latitude (including the Ryukyu
                            Islands and the Daito Islands), Nanpo Shoto south of Sofu Gan (including
                            the Bonin Islands and the Volcano Islands), Parece Vela, and Marcus
                            Island is vital to the security interests of the United States, that the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff could not concur in action to return these islands
                            to Japan, and that no change in United States policy in regard to these
                            islands should be contemplated <pb xml:id="pg_1320" n="1320" facs="0264"/>until a condition of stability has been firmly established in the Far
                            East.</p>
                        <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. The most recent trends and events in the Far East;</item>
                            <item>b. The recently approved United States policy toward Southeast
                                Asia (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 124/2); and</item>
                            <item>c. The uncertainties of a United Nations trusteeship over this
                                strategic area in the event that Japan becomes a member of the
                                United Nations.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In the light of these considerations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are now
                            of the opinion that, for the foreseeable future, a trusteeship would not
                            provide adequate assurance that the long-term military objectives in
                            connection with these islands will be realized. Accordingly, the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff now consider that there should be no change in the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> of the islands in question until such
                            time as the politico-military situation in the Far East becomes
                            stabilized in a way favorable to United States security interests.</p>
                        <p>4. It is recommended that, subject to your concurrence, the foregoing
                            view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff be conveyed to the Secretary of State,
                            further stating that the Department of Defense is prepared to furnish
                            representatives for a State–Defense working group, if it is considered
                            necessary by the Department of State, to prepare a recommended U.S.
                            Governmental position on this matter. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider
                            that a firm, early decision on the subject matter is necessary. If such
                            a working group is formed, it is recommended that the attached “Facts
                            Bearing on the Problem and Discussion,” developed by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff be used by the Department of Defense representatives on the
                            proposed working group as a basis for discussion.</p>

                            recommended the following conclusions “be approved by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">J.C.S.</gloss> as a basis for implementing action

                            Ryukyu Islands; that such political responsibility would serve not only
                            to burden the United States with an economic liability but will stand as
                            a denial to the principle of self determination and might at a later
                            date develop into an irritant to the Japanese; that a U.S. sponsored
                            movement for the return of control over the Ryukyu Islands to the
                            Japanese would constitute an additional step toward cementing
                            U.S.-Japanese security objectives; that action should be deferred until
                            the treaty has been ratified; and that a firm agreement should be
                            reached with Japan to retain our exclusive control of military
                            facilities. The recommendation of <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> was signed by Lt. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HLGDO1">Hickey</persName>, Chief of Staff, and added that the conclusions
                            are also applicable to Parece Vela, Marcus Island and Nanpo Shoto.</p>
                        <p>2. On 21 January 1952, acting on <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>’s recommendation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            reiterated their consistently held position that “strategic control of
                            the Nansei Shoto has been and continues to be vital to the security
                            interests of the United States”, that they “could not concur in action
                            to return these islands to Japan”, and that “no change in U.S. policy in

                        <p>4. In Article 2 of the Peace Treaty, Japan renounced right, title and
                            claim to Korea, Formosa, the Kuriles, Sakhalin, the Mandated Islands,
                            Antarctic area, the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands. It may be
                            inferred that ultimate Japanese sovereignty was recognized over the
                            islands she agreed to place in trusteeship. This conception was conceded

                            Army, U.S. Civil Administrator of the Ryukyu Islands:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. A spot survey of one of the northern islands in the Amami Group
                                indicated that 99 per cent of the people desired return to Japanese
                                sovereignty. In view of the facts that these islands were formerly
                                an integral part of the Kagoshima province of southern Kyushu and
                                that the people were closely related culturally, economically and
                                ethnologically to the mainlanders, and considered themselves higher
                                socially than the people of more southern islands, the results of
                                the poll were not unexpectedly in favor of return to Japan. Recently
                                there has been no concrete evidence of a determined movement for the
                                return of the area to Japan, possibly because of removal of many
                                previous restrictions. This feeling for <pb xml:id="pg_1323" n="1323" facs="0267"/>return to Japan diminishes generally in a
                                southerly direction and inland to rural areas amongst the islands
                                south of the Amami Group. Although no over-all poll of the islands
                                has ever been made, it was estimated that not over 50 per cent
                                desire immediate return to Japanese sovereignty.</item>
                            <item>b. The Amami group is distinct culturally and historically from
                                the rest of the Ryukyu Islands. Economically and historically these
                                people feel that they are more closely related to Japan,
                                specifically Kogoshima Prefecture, than they are to Okinawa and the
                                other southern islands. They resent the undisputed fact that Okinawa
                                will exert a dominant control over government, banking, trade and
                                education in the Ryukyu Islands of which they are now considered a
                                part. The return of the Amami group to Japan would not create a
                                serious economic dislocation in the Ryukyus although some 20,000
                                laborers have moved temporarily to Okinawa as a result of the
                                military construction program there. The return of the Amami group
                                to Japan would remove a difficult political and social problem in
                                the administration of the Ryukyu Islands by the United States. From
                                a political, governmental and social standpoint, it is desirable
                                that this northern group be returned to the Japanese Empire.</item>
                            <item>c. General <persName corresp="#p_LGJM1">Lewis</persName>
                                emphasized the importance of the United States publicly announcing
                                its intentions with respect to the island groups. He indicated that
                                the natives are definitely opposed to trusteeship which they
                                associate with the former mandate status of more southern islands
                                and regard as an unacceptable, degrading and despotic form of rule.
                                An established U.S. definitive position would dispel a lot of
                                conjecture and speculation on the part of Okinawans and facilitate
                                the establishment of democratic governmental processes
                                therein.</item>
                            <item>d. General <persName corresp="#p_LGJM1">Lewis</persName> also
                                expressed the view that if the United States is planning to return
                                the islands to Japan, the transfer should not be effected until (1)
                                the Korean war is over, and (2) Japan is economically and militarily
                                capable of assuming this added responsibility. Obviously neither of
                                these conditions exist today. Even if the Korean war ends soon, it
                                is unlikely Japan could provide for the defense and support of the
                                outer-islands in addition to the home islands without materially
                                decreasing the over-all security of the area.</item>

                            believed to be generally those expressed in a letter dated 10 December
                            1951, subject “Practicable Arrangements for the Southern Islands,”<note n="9" xml:id="d595fn9">See despatch 1021 from Tokyo, <ref target="#d477">Document 477</ref>.</note> which was passed

                            are sufficient to override the United States and United Nations policies
                            of national self determination. (The economic costs of retaining the
                            islands are considered minor in comparison with security advantages.)
                            From a military standpoint, there is no question as to the great value
                            of the subject islands as bases or bulwarks in stemming Communist
                            aggression in the Far East, and ultimately in defending the United
                            States. The United States must have bases that are not dependent upon
                            the temporary political position of Japan, and which are relatively
                            proof against Communist invasion.</p>

                            request by the United States for a trusteeship over strategic areas of
                            the islands would receive favorable action by the United Nations. Even
                            if such a trusteeship were to be granted, it is foreseen that the United
                            States would be constantly harassed in the administration of the
                            trusteeship by the blocking tactics of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>15. Congress has always been reluctant to appropriate funds for the
                            construction of base facilities on other than United States territory
                            except in those cases where the continued availability on a long-term
                            basis of the base area involved appears to be assured. A United Nations
                            trusteeship which might be subject to challenge and annulment if and
                            when Japan becomes a member of the United Nations would not appear to
                            offer to the Congress the necessary assurance of long-term tenure. The
                            fact that considerable funds are being spent by the Department of
                            Defense for permanent construction in the islands under consideration
                            points up the necessity for early decision in this matter.</p>
                        <p>16. Return to Japan with base rights agreements or joint sovereignty with
                            Japan would be unsatisfactory, since the bases would be relatively
                            useless in war if Japan were hostile, and might involve difficulties
                            even if Japan were neutral.</p>

                            action is considered politically unacceptable in view of the fundamental
                            and frequently expressed U.S. policy of self-determination; and is
                            particularly so in the current situation in which the free nations are
                            attempting to check Soviet aggression.</p>
                        <p>18. From the military point of view and in the light of the foregoing
                            considerations, maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> is,
                            for the foreseeable future, the only acceptable means for assuring the
                            accomplishment of U.S. security objectives with respect to the Ryukyus
                            and Bonin Islands. While a policy of maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> might, in the absence of preventive
                            action to condition the Japanese public, constitute an irritant to
                            friendly U.S.-Japanese relations, it does provide the major advantage of
                            retaining U.S. freedom of action until such time, unlike the present,
                            when concrete and important advantages may accrue to the U.S. from a
                            decision affecting the disposition of these islands. This policy is
                            considered preferable to taking a positive step at this time to request
                            a U.S. trusteeship over this area with the United States as sole
                            administering authority. All factors considered, the maintenance of the
                                <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> is believed the best course of
                            action to accomplish U.S. objectives for the foreseeable future.</p>

                            last evening for purpose the latter said of again emphasizing the
                            importance to success of Liberal Party in present electoral campaign of
                            “a financial gesture” on part of US. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> explained that situation required some form of
                            public statement by some US Govt agency indicating that US is viewing
                            with greatest sympathy financial assistance for Japan and that if Japan
                            meets necessary conditions financial aid will be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>I thought it well to mention to <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> that I had heard some doubt expressed that
                            present govt had brought home adequately to Jap public the extent and
                            volume of current US expenditures and financial support already extended
                            by US to Japan. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> protested
                            that such doubt not justified by record and said that govt had taken
                            advantage numerous occasions to indicate to public important extent US
                            financial support and in fact that Jap public cognizant facts.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> urged insistently that I

                            suitable statement prior to Oct 1 elections and asserted that this type
                            US support merited and necessary. Pls let me have your advice as matter
                            priority.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion to inquire what <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>’s best estimate strength his party and he came
                            up with estimate of 235 seats, the required majority being 233. Earlier
                            last evening Aso, <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            son-in-law, gave me an estimate of 220. Appreciating that this is
                            strictly guesswork reminiscent of Gallup in 1948, the flavor I get from
                            my conversations here is that the Liberals are worried. While <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> tells me again that party will
                            put up United Front, in same breath he says that factional split is
                            widening and that group around <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> (especially Mikibukichi, Ohno, Bamboku and
                            company) are utterly reckless in their pursuit of power and patronage.
                            He maintains they wld exercise harmful effect on Jap foreign policy. The
                            more I see of the attitude of the <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> faction as well as that of the opposition
                            groups, the more I wonder whether our policies here wld not suffer at
                            their hands. If we can devise in favor of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> element, as imperfect as it may be a formula of

                            with practical problem of what may develop in elections of Oct 1. We are
                            asked for a statement only—not a loan. This is not necessarily
                            expensive. If we don’t do it and elections swing against us we might
                            reproach ourselves later. If we pause for moment to consider
                            possibilities it might be well to remember now that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> element of Liberal Party has
                            promised to seek gradual increase of Jap defense power in proportion to
                            its nat strength and to take steps toward nat security in accordance
                            with US-Jap security treaty. It also stands for estab of collective
                            security machinery and coop with free world. The announced purposes of
                            remaining 3 major opposition parties are not as favorable. Progressive
                            Party promises to seek recovery of lost terms; to advocate internat
                            atomic energy control and disarmament; revision of unequal treaties such
                            as US-Jap security treaty and US-Jap admin agrmt and re-examination of
                            various ordinances issued during occupation. Right wing Socialists will
                            seek drastic revision of US-Jap security treaty and US-Jap admin agrmt;
                            and attempt to work out overall disarmament program thru <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and conclude treaties of commerce and
                            navigation with all nations on equal footing.</p>

                        <p>Left wing Socialists promise to adhere to independent neutral dipl
                            policy, to abolish mil power and US-Jap security treaty; to rqst return
                            of Okinawa, Bon Islands, Kurile Islands and So-Sakhalin and seek
                            interchange of trade and culture with Asian countries.</p>
                        <p>Certainly there are disquieting overtones in some announced policies of 3
                            major opposition parties. In fact there is definite ring of hostility in
                            some of it. Naturally sweeping platform assertions are subj to discount.
                            Nevertheless Liberal Party has not seen fit to adopt even hint of
                            anti-Americanism in its platform. Starting from there I feel that Amer
                            chances for future with this party in power will be more favorable.</p>
                        <p>The argument that this or any other party may be considered US puppet
                            does not impress me. If when we are asked to help our friends we
                            hesitate because of that doubt, it might be better to retire into
                            complete state of isolationism. I believe in a sitn like this if party
                            leadership is convinced that action will be to their advantage that we
                            shld give them credit for understanding their own domestic problem a

                        <p>[Here follows a list of persons present (10). <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName> led the Department of Defense group; <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> that of the Department of
                            State.]</p>
                        <p>The meeting was called to discuss a list of State Department questions
                            concerning the Defense Department position on the disposition of the
                            Ryukyus. A copy of this list is attached.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the position of the Defense Department is that political
                            control is necessary for military control and that there should,
                            therefore, be no change from the present status of the Ryukyu and Bonin
                            islands. The Defense Department representatives made it completely clear
                            that this position applies to the whole chain of islands including the
                            Amami Oshima group and Parece Vela. The position is predicated mainly
                            upon an assumption that Japan may conceivably adopt a neutralist
                            position and that, if <pb xml:id="pg_1334" n="1334" facs="0278"/>sovereignty over the Ryukyus is returned to Japan, such a position
                            would make it impossible either legally or politically to operate
                            effectively from bases in the Ryukyus in the event of general war.</p>
                        <p>Some of the advantages cited by the Defense representatives for the
                            continuation of the present status for the whole island chain are
                            summarized below:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. From the point of view of the Air Force the bases in the
                                Ryukyus are ideally situated to give a maximum bombing radius which
                                covers all Asia and can even reach southern Russia. Seven air bases
                                are planned and three of them are now in existence. The Amami Oshima
                                group now has one radar installation, and there are other radar
                                sites which have been surveyed. These radar sites are considered an
                                indispensable part of the warning net.</item>
                            <item>2. The Navy requires the bases and harbors in the island group.
                                These bases vastly increase the use which can be made of submarines
                                since fueling and refueling can be done so much closer to
                                operational areas. The Amami group is useful because there is a
                                shelter anchorage there which will be better than Buckner Bay in the
                                event of typhoons.</item>
                            <item>3. The ground forces count on this group as a primary staging area
                                for the Pacific in the event of general war.</item>
                            <item>4. Some of the islands—for example, Parece Vela—are not worth much
                                directly but in unfriendly hands would jeopardize the line of
                                communications. In addition they may be useful for staging areas and
                                to increase the element of deception in certain military and naval
                                operations.</item>
                            <item>5. Various covert operations are now centered in the Bonin
                                Islands.</item>
                            <item>6. If the Japanese have sovereignty over these islands, and
                                consequently have a relatively free run of them, the security
                                problem is increased.</item>
                            <item>7. If sovereignty and administrative control are returned to
                                Japan, it would become considerably more difficult and
                                time-consuming—perhaps impossible in some cases—to get agreement and
                                authorization to extend a runway at an airport or to put in a radar
                                installation at a new site.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In answer to a question about the utility of the bases if there were
                            hostile air forces operating from the mainland and hostile naval forces
                            including submarines operating in the area, the Defense representatives
                            said that they believe that the islands are defensible now or with the
                            anticipated build up in the event of an emergency.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned with agreement to resume the discussion of the
                            State Department question at 3:00 on Monday, September 29.</p>

                        <p>6. What type of arrangements for military use of the Ryukyus is required
                            in view of the determination of their strategic importance and the basic

                        <p>Gen Herren as spokesman expressed sympathy for Korean alarm with respect
                            to Jap fishing and patrolling activities close to Korean coast; and

                            Korean coastal waters (shown to <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> on map) as restricted mil zone barred to Jap
                            fishing vessels. Proposed <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> restricted
                            zone actually follows lines Jap recently announced wld be patrolled by
                            them with exception sector along 34th parallel which <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> will revise so that line will pass well
                            to south of Chejudo. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> probably
                            not aware similarity new restricted zone to Jap patrol line. In any case
                            he was delighted that <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>
                            prepared declare prohibited zone, so that removed main cause his earlier
                            concern, viz., establishment of patrol line by Jap.</p>
                        <p>Pyun pointed out new zone did not in many places cover areas within
                                “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line” and stated he
                            assumed Korean Naval patrols wld still be able operate up to “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line”. It was pointed out to him
                            that we did not want to relate restricted zone in any way to “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line” or to discuss “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line” at this time. Principal
                            problem before us was to prevent unfortunate clashes between Korea and
                            Jap over fishing and that under present conditions potential areas for
                            such clashes were within restricted mil zone. We hoped that Korea and
                            Jap wld get together soon to work out fisheries <pb xml:id="pg_1337" n="1337" facs="0281"/>agreement which presumably wld involve

                            had discussed with him entry of Japanese patrol vessels only and had not

                            stated that this version is incorrect and that the order will be

                            </note>
                            This order was repeated to Embassies Pusan and Tokyo with request we
                            relay information to governments concerned.</p>
                        <p>Zone as established completely envelopes Korean peninsula and would
                            appear to make all contiguous waters out of bounds. The short press
                            release issued by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> has brought sharp
                            reaction from Japanese fishing and shipping circles. Foreign Office has
                            sent note to Embassy asking for detailed info re zone, its legal effect
                            and method of administration. Korean press is reported to have claimed
                            this as victory for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and to have
                            indicated that <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> has
                            endorsed the “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> line”.</p>
                        <p>In view of this and in view of my reservations about method of <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>’s action, I have refrained
                            temporarily from sending any official notification to <gloss target="#t_JG1">JG</gloss> and am exploring nature of defense zone
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> and staff of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. This action was hastily taken and not
                            well conceived. Our Navy authorities seem to consider the zone
                            impossible to administer as an area of total prohibition and they have
                            not yet issued any patrol changes to implement its terms. No
                            implementing regulations have been prepared by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. It is hoped that the zone will be administered in
                            liberal fashion and that it be used principally as a threat to prevent
                            smuggling and for security purposes. At same time, its very existence,
                            even without enforcement, should give satisfaction to <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and should temporarily at least
                            calm his fears re Jap fishing exploitation.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed matter informally with <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> who realizes now that there are political and
                            economic issues involved which may cause some difficulties. I have
                            emphasized that question of fishing rights in these waters is matter
                            under negotiation between Japanese and Koreans and that stated policy of
                            US is not to prejudice these negotiations. I have told him that <gloss target="#t_JG1">JG</gloss> is opposed in principle <pb xml:id="pg_1340" n="1340" facs="0284"/>to establishment of any line
                            to govern fishing and pointed out that Koreans may interpret this action
                            as an indirect endorsement of “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> line” which is of course unacceptable to <gloss target="#t_JG1">JG</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d603fn3">Ambassador

                        <p>I had been led to believe that perhaps <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and Navy authorities were coming round to Dept’s
                            viewpoint re return of Islands to Jap control. Instead I found <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> sympathetic but adamant in <pb xml:id="pg_1341" n="1341" facs="0285"/>his determination to maintain
                                <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. <gloss target="#t_COMNAVFE1">COMNAVFE</gloss>

                            at least to persuade <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> to
                            accept compromise arrangement which wld permit starting Jap control of
                            Haha Jima ....</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s justification of his
                            unwillingness to agree to return of islands to Jap control is basically
                            strategic. In essence he asserts that in light of danger of Soviet
                            aggression and his own responsibilities as <gloss target="#t_CINCPACFLT1">CINCPACFLT</gloss> complete US control of
                            Iwo Jima as an air base and Chichi Jima as submarine base is essential.
                            He maintains that Yokosuka and Okinawa are both highly vulnerable in
                            event of an all-out Sov attack and that Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima are
                            vitally necessary as auxiliary bases should US forces be driven out of
                            first two mentioned. On that assumption he is unwilling to increase
                            responsibilities of security and supply inherent in presence of larger
                            foreign civilian population on these islands. He is willing to permit
                            present colony of 141 persons residing on Chichi Jima to remain there.
                            There is no population of any sort on Haha Jima and only inhabitants on
                            Iwo Jima are US military and occasional Jap workman employed by
                            contractors.</p>
                        <p>As far as I am able to ascertain Chichi Jima provides ideal submarine and
                            naval base with super natural harbor Jap underground construction gun
                            emplacements storage radio and other installations which were built over
                            period many years immensely valuable. Practically all civilian housing
                            was destroyed during war and small farms and pastures returned to jungle
                            growth. About 3,000 civilians lived there pre-war supporting themselves
                            principally by fishing. Smaller Haha Jima has little or no naval
                            interest and the several tiny islands represent no practical importance.
                            . . .</p>
                        <p>I took great pains to explain Dept’s position in detail to Adm <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> who several times said he was
                            surprised as he had been led to believe that Dept had come round to his
                            point of view:</p>
                        <p>Adm <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and I explored number
                            of possible alternative solutions for consideration in event <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> firm on this as <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> says they are. One solution
                            which occurred to us is bilateral arrangement for a form of leasehold
                            along lines of wartime agreement covering bases at places like Bermuda,
                            Trinidad or Argentina.</p>
                        <p>On our return to Tokyo we had long talk with <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> to whom <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated his viewpoint. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> of course was most disappointed over Navy’s
                            attitude. He reviewed Jap position which is familiar to Dept stressing
                            point that it is difficult for Jap Govt to understand discrimination
                            between small Jap colony descendants of European stock now permitted on
                            Chichi Jima while ordinary Jap evacuees are barred stating that this
                            could only be viewed as racial <pb xml:id="pg_1342" n="1342" facs="0286"/>discrimination. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            vehemently denied this saying it was the first suggestion he had ever
                            heard of such a thing and pointing out that permission is being granted
                            to about 25 present residents to marry Jap Nationals in Jap and take
                            them to island. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> declared
                            opposition based solely on strategic necessity which Jap Govt should
                            understand as it had removed civilian population for same reason in
                            1944.</p>
                        <p>We mentioned idea of lease arrangement as a personal and unofficial
                            thought referring to charter party negotiations for 18 US frigates and

                            to a different basis plus possible additional compensation in one form
                            or another. While this idea appeals to me as a possibility I made it
                            quite clear to <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> that Dept
                            had not authorized suggestion. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> seemed to grasp at the idea and said it was
                            worth careful study.</p>
                        <p>Throughout it was evident that Navy is not thinking in terms of
                            trusteeship or any return to Jap control. Its planning for development
                            Chichi Jima as submarine base apparently had progressed in important
                            measure.</p>
                        <p>(2) Ryukyus. Gen <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> tells me
                            that he is under strict injunction from <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to make no concession re political control of any of
                            these islands and states that <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            insists on maintenance <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. Personally he,
                            as do some officers his command, favors release Amami Oshima and
                            possibly other of the northern islands of this group to Jap political
                            control but he says matter now frozen by <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> directive. There has been no reference to this question
                            by Jap Govt during past few days. There is only mild public interest
                            manifest at moment concerning either Bonins or Ryukyus. Of course this
                            could mount easily if Jap Govt sees fit to stimulate it.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions. Foregoing essentially is position re islands. Navy’s
                            viewpoint strategic situation and present danger together with its idea
                            of its own responsibilities and needs difficult to dispute. Conception
                            is new to me that Yokusuka and Okinawa highly vulnerable but if true I
                            can well understand Navy’s unwillingness to assume additional security
                            risk and supply responsibilities inherent in larger civilian population
                            in Bonins. . . . Question of lease arrangement and compensation for
                            Bonin refugees could be explored. Perhaps this kind of solution might be
                            feasible and acceptable to Jap. It is always hard to assess size to
                            which a political issue of this type might be blown but large scale
                            agitation on this score is not visible on present horizon.<note n="9" xml:id="d604fn9">The Embassy set forth its views on the topics

                            embody Jap Government and US obligations to meet agreed expansion

                            desire such agreement with Jap Government be sought as necessary support
                            for military assistance request to Congress? Obtaining written agreement
                            prior January by no means certain.</p>
                        <p>Summary follows Jap budget problem:</p>
                        <p>Total expenditures 853 billion yen current budget probably be increased
                            to approximately 900 billion by supplemental budget. Liberal Party
                            committed to tax reduction approximately 120 billion to which no Diet
                            opposition. Therefore, would probably unbalance budget if total
                            expenditures increased to cover added defense appropriation.</p>
                        <p>Following additional non-defense expenditures must be budgeted Jap fiscal
                            year 1953 (broad estimates): Prewar bonded debt service 14 billion;
                                <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement 11 billion
                            (German basis); plus undetermined expenditures for reparations, economic
                            development and assistance to war bereaved. In view tax reduction and
                            inevitable increase in non-defense expenditures, increased defense
                            appropriation possible (with balanced budget) only by reducing normal
                            expenditures. This would mean principally reducing government personnel
                            which is extremely unpopular. Repeated determined efforts this direction
                            have been largely fruitless. Would be highly dubious urge Jap Government
                            undertake such unpopular move in addition to political burden of
                            advocating rearmament. I anticipate Jap Government will strenuously
                            resist increasing defense appropriations above present 3.6 percent of
                            national income (approximately 21 percent national budget) 185 billion
                            yen for Jap fiscal year 1953. Build-up rate recommended above calls for
                            Jap Government funds 160 billion yen (excluding carry-over) in Jap
                            fiscal year 1953. [Garble] 65 billion for support US Forces make total
                            225 or 4.5 percent of national income. In this context, possibility
                            mentioned <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> additional
                            expenditure by Jap 50 to 100 million dollars for US equipment and
                            supplies appears improbable under present circumstances.</p>

                            why it is necessary that the new national safety force appear to public
                            in favorable light. The public dreads the expense of a military
                            establishment. We said that as he knew Americans did not like the
                            expense either but Soviet aggression and expansionism left no

                            obviously questions arise in minds of thinking Japs as to the firmness
                            of our intentions to defend Japan under Security Treaty. Naturally

                        <p>While I concur in Gen <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>’s
                            recommendations re action to be taken by <gloss target="#t_FEAF1">FEAF</gloss>, I wish to provide Dept with better analysis than we
                            have thus far prepared re Jap reactions to previous overflights etc.
                            Thus far as Dept is undoubtedly aware, info re these overflights has
                            been very closely held and Jap public is not conscious of number of
                            violations committed by Sov aircraft. There is, of course, some small
                            sentiment that the very presence US Forces in Japan is provocative and
                            this prevails as would be expected in left circles. It is my opinion
                            that the bulk of Jap opinion would welcome an indication of firm action
                            on US part. It is also my opinion that Jap reactions actual engagement
                            or shooting down Sov aircraft would be favorable from our point of view
                            and also would stimulate Jap support of rearmament program. I discussed
                            this question informally with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            and he agreed.</p>
                        <p>Re dipl steps which Japan and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should
                            take in this connection this will be treated in subsequent tel.</p>

                        <p>These figures differ so substantially from the original Defense

                            Budget that the whole question is going to have to be resubmitted to the
                            Joint Chiefs. This process will take so long that Defense cannot meet
                            the Bureau of the Budget’s time schedule, and consequently it has been
                            informally agreed that the Bureau of the Budget on its own will make
                            certain modifications in the estimates for Japan. We do not yet know the
                            nature of the modifications which they will make, but we have made
                            available to them the information which just came back to us from
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The major policy problem involves the commencement of planning and
                            training for a Japanese air force. An outgoing

                            Department thinking favors such a development. However, the final
                            decision was left until we had an indication of the thinking of the
                            Embassy and the Command. Now that we have had that indication, <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> is preparing a memorandum from you to Mr.

                            the first stage of our military courses of action with respect to Japan
                            should be to “assist Japan to develop a balanced ten-division ground
                            force and appropriate air and naval arms”. Until recently, no steps had
                            been taken in the direction of the development of an “appropriate air
                            arm”. Some thinking about the necessity of building a balanced defense
                            force has taken place in Japan among various private and semi-official
                            groups, especially one in which Admiral Nomura is prominent. There has
                            also been a fair amount of speculation on this subject in the press in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>So far as the United States is concerned, the Joint Chiefs last December
                            approved planning goals for a Japanese air force. (See the table below.)
                            Operating on the basis of this approved program, Defense included
                            $187,000,000 for assistance for the development of a Japanese air force
                            in their preliminary submission to the Bureau of the Budget of the
                            Mutual Security Program for Fiscal Year 1954. The following table shows

                            as to what should be done about Japanese rearmament in Fiscal Year 1954,

                            submitted a joint recommendation that $287,000,000 be authorized in
                            Fiscal Year 1954 for a Japanese air force. This sum would provide
                            technical and flying training schools, two F–86 fighter squadrons, one
                            air depot wing, and service and support units. This is part of phased
                            program through June 1956 to provide 2,500 technical and 300 flying
                            graduates annually, three F–86 interceptor wings, one F–89 interceptor
                            wing, two fighter bomber F–86 wings, one tactical reconnaissance wing,
                            two air transport wings and two air depot wings.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> in a separate

                                attached. The telegram was CX 58128 from <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> to the Department of the Army for the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. (Department of Defense
                                files)</note> recommended that planning for a Japanese air force
                            should proceed promptly and that he be authorized to discuss this
                            question with the Japanese Prime Minister in company with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>. He reasoned that the
                            most immediate and the greatest single threat to the security of Japan
                            lies in the Communist air threat. However, he believes that forces
                            capable of external aggression—specifically such forces as long-range
                            bombers and carrier borne aircraft—should not be developed by Japan. In
                            consequence, his recommendation accords closely with the earlier
                            planning by the Joint Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the Department of State should support the development of
                            a Japanese air force. While it is desirable that as much as possible of
                            the initiative in these matters should be taken by the Japanese
                            themselves, it is clear that both the Government and private circles in
                            Japan are giving a great deal of thought to this subject. It is
                            therefore the more important that we place ourselves in a position to
                            assist them in the further development of a balanced defense force. If
                            we are to do so, we must proceed at once since the lead time on aircraft
                            is at least two years; and unless the Korean <pb xml:id="pg_1361" n="1361" facs="0305"/>war ends, it will be 1956 or 1957 before the
                            aircraft authorized in the Fiscal Year 1954 program can be delivered to
                            the Japanese. Furthermore, the training of technical and ground
                            personnel should begin as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Various arguments have been cited against undertaking a Japanese air
                            force program at this time. One of them is the fact that the Japanese
                            Constitution specifically forbids the maintenance of defense forces.
                            However, the Japanese are through various devices moving ahead with the
                            development of a ground force and are apparently willing to take at
                            least the preliminary steps (including training of ground and flight
                            personnel) toward the development of an air force. In addition Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> has told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> that he plans
                            to take steps to build up public support for rearmament in Japan and to
                            move in the direction of an amendment to the Constitution. Another
                            argument against a Japanese air force lies in the fears which it will
                            arouse in other nations in the Pacific area of a possible renewal of a
                            Japanese aggressive threat. However, these fears can be counteracted by
                            concentration on the types of aircraft which are clearly designed
                            primarily for the defense of Japanese territory, and by advance
                            notification and careful explanation to the other nations who are most
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>The basic policy decision was made in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            125/2. The present question is therefore one of timing and of defining
                            what is meant by an “appropriate air arm”. In

                            respect to the air force need to be settled now while the Mutual

                            intend to engage aircraft violating Jap territory. I note that
                            O’Shaughnessy’s 790<note n="3" xml:id="d618fn3">Dated Nov. 14, not

                                Moscow.</note> suggests that some form of warning against Sov
                            overflights would seem desirable. Pending discussion <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and further study it would in
                            our opinion be preferable to avoid a prior public announcement. It is
                            noted that the B–29 apparently was either shot down or forced into sea
                            by Sov aircraft without prior Sov public announcement. Naturally we
                            would welcome O’Shaughnessy’s further comment if there are urgent
                            reasons unknown to us for public announcement.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe it necessary or wise to notify the Sovs of our intended
                            action or make any public announcement concerning our policy. Little is
                            to be gained by thus putting them on their guard and would hardly be
                            expected by them in view of their provocative action in shooting down
                            our B–29. Any public pronouncement would only invite a precipitation of
                            public comment which might prove disadvantageous to us, playing into the
                            hands of those who use the argument that the presence of US security
                            forces in Jap constitutes provocation for hostile Sov action. The
                            dramatic circumstances surrounding the forcing to land of Sov aircraft
                            or the destruction while actually violating Jap territory would provide
                            much more advantageous atmosphere in which to make any public
                            announcement.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Memorandum of Conversation With Jiru Shirasu at the
                            Shoreham Hotel, December 4, 1952, 9 a.m.</p>
                        <p>I saw Mr. Shirasu pursuant to a personal request from Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>. Mr. Shirasu said that
                            the Prime Minister was particularly concerned over the pressures to
                            which the Japanese Government was being subjected in relation to
                            rearmament. He said that the Japanese people had been educated
                            throughout the Occupation to the belief that it was wrong to have a
                            military establishment; this was in the Japanese Constitution, and it
                            would not be possible to develop any large armament without first
                            re-educating the Japanese people. Mr. Shirasu said that the Prime
                            Minister realized that this would probably be necessary but he urged
                            that time be given to avoid a political upheaval which might put the
                            Socialists in power on a “neutrality” platform.</p>
                        <p>I said that I could not speak for the incoming Administration; that I had
                            never discussed the subject with General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>; and that I did not know what the views of
                            the Defense Department were or would be.</p>
                        <p>I recalled that I myself, in my public utterances, had never urged the
                            Japanese to rearm, believing that Japanese policy in this respect should
                            come from the Japanese themselves and not seem to be imposed by
                            outsiders. I stated that I believed that the Japanese people must
                            realize that they would not be a fully sovereign nation so long as they
                            were wholly dependent upon another nation for their protection in a
                            world of danger; that they must realize that as a matter of their own
                            self-respect they would have to bear some responsibility and fair share
                            of the common burden of defense of the free world. I said I was
                            confident that the Japanese people would come to realize this.</p>
                        <p>I said that I did not know what was the present estimate of the imminence
                            of peril or the urgency of Japanese rearmament because I had not
                            recently had access to this type of security information. I said that
                            information of this character which might come to me later might lead me
                            to feel that there was a great urgency but that, if the information made
                            me feel this way probably the same <pb xml:id="pg_1365" n="1365" facs="0309"/>information would lead the Japanese Government and
                            people to feel the same way.</p>
                        <p>I concluded by re-emphasizing that the views I expressed were merely
                            views that I had held over the past and that the views of the incoming
                            Administration were yet to be formulated and many of the elements which
                            would determine that formulation could not be brought together until
                            after the Administration was actually in power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shirasu thanked me and said that the point of view I had expressed
                            would, he knew, be reassuring to the Prime Minister.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Japan</p>
                        <p>It was interesting to get to Japan after the Peace Treaty had gone into
                            effect. On the whole I was quite favorably impressed with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> and what he has done.
                            He has a political sensitivity which some of his predecessors did not
                            have. Also the close relationship which exists between General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> is most helpful.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese themselves are to some extent still living in a dream world.
                            They are comparatively prosperous right now. I noticed a great change in
                            the personal appearance of the people from a year ago. They have more
                            spirit and life and appear healthier. They are making progress in
                            cleaning up and reconstruction has gone ahead at a tremendous rate.
                            This, however, is a prosperity <pb xml:id="pg_1366" n="1366" facs="0310"/>built to some extent on sand which may run out when <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> special procurement and our troops are
                            moved out. There is not a great deal of evidence that the Japanese are
                            really taking steps to get prepared for what will happen when the
                            present situation comes to an end. Mr. Ichimada,<note n="2" xml:id="d620fn2">Hisato Ichimada.</note> Governor of the Bank of
                            Japan, is worried about these things and thinking about them. Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said they were
                            going to follow the <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> line
                            but that taxes will have to be reduced. He has only a rudimentary
                            appreciation of economics and economic factors. This was corroborated by
                            Ichimada who said the difficulty in Japan was that political leaders
                            have no knowledge of economics. Ichimada is conscious of the problems
                            facing Japan, I think, and as far as he can, is doing something about
                            them. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> is wobbly about
                            rearmament. He gives lip service to the necessity for some form of
                            Japanese defense force but does not recognize the realities or know how
                            to start. The younger people in the Foreign Office seem to be more aware
                            of the true nature of the problem.</p>
                        <p>Another item of importance discussed was the status of forces
                                agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d620fn3">That is, on the status of

                                was not signed until Feb. 19, 1954; see <ref target="#d738">Document

                            no signed agreement concluded before next April 28th when the U.S. Japan
                            Administrative Agreement comes up for possible revision. I believe the
                            Japanese will insist oh the U.S. agreeing to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula and that they will then
                            readily agree to giving other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces
                            equal treatment.</p>
                        <p>There is a great reluctance on the part of the Japanese people to rearm
                            because of the economic burden. I suggested to them that if they could
                            get an agreed plan, even on a small scale, the people might see it would
                            not be as bad as they anticipated. They are also still worried about
                            building up a military caste which will take over the Government. I
                            tried to point out in a speech I made at the <pb xml:id="pg_1367" n="1367" facs="0311"/>American-Japan Society<note n="6" xml:id="d620fn6">For text of this address, “Japan and Free Asia”,
                                made in Tokyo on Nov. 1, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, Dec. 1, 1952, p. 857.</note> that it should be
                            possible to build up a military system which would be their servant and
                            not their master. That appealed to some but others are emphatically
                            against it.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese relations with Korea are extremely bad, although they are
                            ready at the present time to make very real concessions to the Koreans,
                            according to what they said. They are ready to have their Foreign
                            Minister pay a personal call on President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, but not unless there is some assurance that he can
                            come back with some agreement. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> is completely unreasonable and he is convinced
                            there is a group in the American Embassy in Tokyo which wants to give
                            Korea back to Japan. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> says
                            they cannot have any agreement with Japan unless Japan in this agreement
                            or along with the agreement formally and publicly renounce the treaties
                            of annexation of 1910; and the Japanese say they cannot do that. The
                            Japanese feel that these treaties have been superseded by the Peace
                            Treaty and they do not want to bring up the past but prefer to settle
                            the situation as it now exists.</p>
                        <p>Reparations is another problem confronting the Japanese. They realize
                            they have to do something. Defense measures and reparations are the main
                            problem worrying them and sooner or later, I believe, we will be
                            involved in them. We must make up our minds what can and should be done
                            and try to bring it about. <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName>, our Economic Counselor, has been thinking about the
                            problem of reparations and has submitted a suggested solution which
                            deserves study.<note n="7" xml:id="d620fn7">Documentation on this
                                proposal has not been found in Department of State files.</note> We
                            will have to take a more active part both on the Korean and reparations
                            problems, I fear, if we are to keep things on an even keel.</p>
                        <p>The military people and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> are worrying about the recent flurry of
                            overflights of Soviet planes over Hokkaido. Comparing present Russian
                            activity with that over the past six months, one can see that it has
                            increased tremendously over northern Japan and the Kuriles.</p>
                        <p>There is a constant tendency on the part of the Japanese finance people
                            to cut down appropriations for the National Safety Forces and also for
                            the Maritime body, which disturbs Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and others concerned. There is also a general
                            feeling among our Commonwealth friends that they will not be informed
                            about Japanese rearmament plans, but will be confronted by a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi>. I think we should keep the
                            Commonwealth informed and sufficiently ahead of time so that it will not
                            appear to be routine. If <pb xml:id="pg_1368" n="1368" facs="0312"/>we
                            do this, I believe we can obtain their acquiescence if not their active
                            support.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese are worried about trade restrictions, particularly as they
                            might affect their trade in Southeast Asia. They are worried about the
                            British and the British are worried about the Japanese. There seemed to
                            me to be a willingness on the part of many Japanese businessmen to make
                            a real effort to line up to internationally accepted fair trade
                            standards as well as a recognition that Japan would have to prove its
                            good intentions if it expected to regain its trading position in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to make any quick, easy statement about whether the
                            situation in Japan is good or bad. All sorts of things could go wrong
                            politically, economically and other ways. The <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government is not too strong and there is some
                            feeling that there will have to be another election next spring and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> might not survive such
                            an election. <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> is in bad
                            physical condition and it is doubtful that he could take over as Prime
                            Minister, but he still has great influence. The Japanese feel that the
                            results of the election as far as throwing out the Communists was
                            concerned should not be interpreted too optimistically because they
                            believe the large increase in representatives of the Left Wing
                            Socialists was largely made up of people who are in fact Communists. A
                            professor at the Tokyo University said that a year ago or so all his
                            students were going Communist. The professor himself is very
                            antiCommunist but in spite of his teachings, the students were taking
                            the opposite line. This year the situation is different and the students
                            are very anti-Communist. The professor says this is due to the fact that
                            the Communists had not been able to push the Americans out of Korea, but
                            had been thrown back, and that the U.S. was more active in supporting
                            the Chinese Nationalist government on Formosa. While this may be an
                            oversimplification, it does represent a typical Oriental way of looking
                            at things.</p>

                            Jap political difficulties and Prime Minister’s preoccupation with many
                            problems to burden him with this matter during Diet session. I explained
                            that it is necessary for reasons both relating to US legislation and
                            planning as well as international situation that there be closest

                            members including Prime Minister on subject of Jap rearmament and
                            Finance Minister Mukai’s reference to tax reduction I was confused as to
                            Prime Minister’s basic thinking and program regarding article nine of
                            Jap constitution; buildup of national security forces; expenditure of

                            and former’s reference to pressures on Japanese Government to rearm
                            suggesting that we here had not understood that any pressure had been
                            exerted but to contrary an effort had been made to refrain from anything
                            which might be interpreted as pressure. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that we, of course, would appreciate that
                            basic attitude of Japanese Government, regarding rearmament is of
                            necessity delicate state secret; Japanese people still under impact of
                            US occupational policy of demilitarization and destruction of war
                            potential. He referred to General <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthur</persName>’s earlier policies against payment of pensions
                            to veterans, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s policy regarding

                            militarism, etc. Obviously Japanese people need time for adjustment to
                            later conception and awakening to need of defense organization as
                            inherent right of independent state.</p>
                        <p>He made no reference to necessity military program keeping pace with
                            economic limitations. He referred to plan which he said had been
                            referred to Chief of Staff <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                            informally for study relating to Japanese military production and
                            Japanese Government desire to utilize former arsenals and other
                            equipment for earlier production of military items. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> amplified latter point by
                            referring to additional thought of providing other areas such as
                            Indochina with military equipment possibly under head of reparations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> also explained that
                            Shirasu’s reference to pressures no doubt related to tactics of
                            parliamentary opposition in Diet which continually charged that Japanese
                            Government under US pressure to rearm. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said it was not intended to convey impression
                            that US was actually exerting any pressure. He also referred to US
                            Presidential campaign references to Asiatics fighting Asiatics.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> then reviewed
                            situation relating to <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss> ground force
                            pointing to lack of Japanese coordination on lower echelons re planning
                            and operations as well as to long delay which has occurred in bringing
                            ground force to ceiling of 110,000. He also expressed his concern over
                            unnecessary delay by agencies of the Japese <pb xml:id="pg_1371" n="1371" facs="0315"/>anese Government primarily Finance Ministry,
                            National Safety Agency, and National Safety Force, in obligating
                            appropriated funds for procurement of essential equipment and training
                            areas and for construction of necessary schools and installations. He
                            referred to fact that we are prepared to support the present
                            four-division force with the additional equipment required from US
                            sources. He also stated that today such equipment is in great demand
                            especially in view of pressure to equip more <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions and even, for example, to meet demands from
                            Chinese Nationalist Government for equipment. He explained that to meet
                            need to equip additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions
                            he dipped into his theater reserve rather than divert equipment held for
                            Japanese forces which is still top priority under our present policy.
                            However, it is difficult to justify such retention in absence of earnest
                            effort on part of Japanese Government to build up its force even to
                            primary target of 110,000. He pointed to fact that US Forces in Japan
                            proper counted only 2 1/3 divisions and that 1/3 of division had been
                            allocated to Korean theater. We would like to transfer responsibility
                            for ground force defense of Hokkaido to Japanese Government at earliest
                            opportunity, if possible this summer.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> seemed to be visibly impressed
                            with this part of General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>’s remarks. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> expressed surprise regarding General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>’s point on lack of understanding
                            at <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss> level of authority for coordination with SASJ in
                            development of combined plans, saying that it was his understanding that
                            he had given orders for close cooperation. He said this would be
                            rectified immediately and <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>
                            also assured General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> that
                            word would go down immediately to insure that there would be complete
                            understanding at divisional level which has not been case up to now.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> also said that
                            recruiting had not lived up to expectations but that he could assure
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> that ceiling of
                            110,000 would be reached shortly. Present recruiting plan has increased
                            figure from recent 77,000 to approximately 99,000.</p>
                        <p>I referred to our problems in Washington as added reason why frank
                            discussion is necessary at this time mentioning General <persName corresp="#p_VGHS1">Vandenberg</persName>’s comment during his recent
                                visit<note n="3" xml:id="d622fn3">
                                <p>Possibly a reference to some of

                                    on Nov. 19 with <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                                    and other U.S. officials. One section of the memorandum of the
                                    conversation reads:</p>
                                <p>“5. Concerning budgetary justification that he would have to
                                    present to the Congress, General <persName corresp="#p_VGHS1">Vandenberg</persName> pointed out that:</p>
                                <p>“a. The allocation would have to be in the Fiscal Year 1954
                                    budget or no results would be apparent until 1956.</p>
                                <p>“b. If the beginnings of an air establishment were made under the
                                    present Congress, a moral obligation would exist for the
                                    incoming one.</p>
                                <p>“c. If possible, the request for financial and material aid
                                    should come directly from the Japanese Government. A go ahead

                            are to be appropriated for fiscal year 1954. I said with advent new
                            Congress no doubt numerous questions would be raised not only regarding
                            Japan but contributions to collective security free nations being made
                            by individual countries including Japan. It had been difficult to answer
                            recent questions put by some of our visiting Senators regarding Japan’s
                            rearmament program for reasons which <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> would fully understand. I expressed opinion that
                            we would be faced by numerous questions on this subject during coming
                            months.</p>
                        <p>Neither <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> seemed prepared to give any
                            indication regarding Cabinet’s plans for military portion of 1953 budget
                            which Cabinet has now under consideration and about which it meets
                            December 31. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> stated
                            however regarding unexpended balance in current budget that Japanese
                            Government planned to commit entire 56 billion yen reserve fund. He said
                            that delay in such commitment is not entirely due Japanese causes but
                            due in part to past indecision on United States side regarding purposes
                            for which expenditures should be made. I intimated that non-use of this
                            fund for defense purposes might raise question whether Japan ought
                            contribute more yen to support United States forces. It was apparent
                            that prior to Cabinet consideration new budget <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> were not prepared to clarify Japanese intentions
                            but it is believed that this talk with General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> and myself was very timely
                            because it was evident that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had not fully understood some practical
                            considerations relating to planning and budget.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> then described
                            situation relating to flights of Soviet aircraft over Hokkaido providing
                            full detailed information of 47 illegal flights which have occurred
                            since October 9. Both <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> manifested intense
                            interest. I explained at this point that we felt that Japanese
                            Government should consider carefully (1) whether it desired to make some
                            form of protest to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> regarding past
                            overflights and if so, what form that protest or statement would take,
                            and (2) give urgent consideration to question of form of protest which
                            should be made in event incident involving forced landing or shooting
                            down of Soviet aircraft on Japanese territory. General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> explained that during past weeks
                            his command was not prepared to take type of action now planned because
                            of unavailability of F–86 (it was necessary to explain what this <pb xml:id="pg_1373" n="1373" facs="0317"/>meant) and under those
                            circumstances it was not felt desirable to announce our purpose or to
                            give warning because we were not in position to implement it. Our
                            aircraft also had been stationed in southern part of Hokkaido so that we
                            were not technically in position to prevent overflights over northern
                            part of island. An air strip is now being provided in northern Hokkaido
                            for that purpose. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> at first
                            seemed to think that this was matter of coordination between <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss> forces in Hokkaido and <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> but General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> explained that this was matter
                            which would have to be handled by <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            as Japan had no equipment or air force to cope with it. At <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s request General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> also agreed to provide full data
                            re past overflights in writing and <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said that this question would be given urgent
                            consideration and study and that they would inform us regarding their
                            formal reaction. General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>
                            also explained that procedure we contemplated in event of future
                            incident involving forced landing or shooting down of Soviet aircraft
                            would be immediate notification Japanese Government by Embassy informing
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> to be followed by bare
                            factual public announcement by <gloss target="#t_FEAF1">FEAF</gloss>.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> said we hope that
                            Japanese Government would be informed of incident within matter of
                            minutes after its occurrence. This seemed to be satisfactory to both
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Meeting terminated on most cordial note with <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> again assuring General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> regarding closest coordination
                            between <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss> and SAASJ as well as
                            build-up of <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss> to 110,000 ceiling.</p>
                        <p>Both General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> and I consider
                            this conversation most timely and constructive. We believe <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> especially now possesses much
                            better knowledge of practical considerations involved. Both he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> indicated general
                            desire to make progress and to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> has read and

                            January. This budget totals 940 billion yen but likely contain only 130
                            billion for defense of which 65 billion for support <pb xml:id="pg_1374" n="1374" facs="0318"/>US Security Forces and 65 billion for <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss>. Reduction defense budget based on

                            extent Japanese Government intends participate in own defense and might
                            well cause Congress review most critically any program military
                            assistance Japan. I suggested that in expansion of <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss> beyond 110,000, development of embryo
                            Air Force, and possible participation in cost heavy equipment ample
                            justification could be found by Prime Minister to support a defense
                            budget at least no smaller than current one.</p>
                        <p>As result I am now told that budget will carry 65 billion for support US
                            Security Forces as separate item plus 80 billion for remainder Japanese
                            Government defense program which amount will be hidden in larger sum
                            including pensions and other items. Later this figure will necessarily
                            be broken down into component parts in Diet presentation. By that time
                            justification of appropriation in excess of sum required for maintenance
                            110,000 must be evolved. On this matter I shall, of course, confer with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> as well as
                            Japanese Government. Cabinet gave tentative approval budget today but

                            by ostensible cordiality and began with fairly lengthy dissertation by
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to effect that he had
                            been glad to visit Japan as guest of General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>; he remembered his preceding
                            visits and then spoke very frankly regarding Korean relations with
                            Japan, saying that he hoped ways and means could be found to improve
                            them. He mentioned especially question of fishing rights, underlining
                            poverty of Korean economy and Korean dependence on fishing for
                            livelihood. He said that he hoped to see representatives of Japanese
                            fishery associations to explain to them problem as viewed by him. He
                            again said that Japan as bigger nation could afford to be more generous
                            in its attitude toward Korea which sacrificed so much in struggle
                            against communism and aggression. He said that at times he was outspoken
                            in his views regarding Japan but he was actuated by friendly spirit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, while making show of good
                            nature and cordiality, was extremely tight-lipped and noncommittal and
                            literally throughout hours conversation contented himself with amenities
                            and jocular references. At end of conversation, <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> referred to virtue of patience
                            and said that in solution of all problems patience is essential.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>, apart from greetings, said
                            not single word. He later told me that he was surprised that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had been so reticent as he had
                            expected him to say more. He added that, of course, they had been
                            through all this before at time of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s earlier visit to Tokyo. I asked <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> whether this contact might lead
                            to resumption of active negotiations looking to establishment of
                            friendly relations between two countries. He said frankly he did not
                            know what <pb xml:id="pg_1376" n="1376" facs="0320"/>next step would be
                            as question rested with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> who had given no indication.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> and I took general line

                            avoided any appearance of attempting to influence conversation.</p>
                        <p>While contact was cordial and perhaps may lead to better understanding,
                            conversation per se was sterile.<note n="3" xml:id="d624fn3">

                                    negotiations, and that while it did not want the U.S. to become
                                    involved in the substance of the talks, it did wish the
                                    Embassies in both countries to encourage them. The Department
                                    stated also its hope that Japan would have the “magnanimity” to
                                    make the first offer. (694.95B/1–1953) Documents in file 694.95B

                        <p>The State–Defense Working Group on the Ryukyus has met a number of times.
                            State Department representation has been Mr. Stelle, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName>, Mr. Hawley and I. Defense
                            representation has included <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Charles
                                Sullivan</persName>, Lt. Colonel Lee of G–3, Colonel Yeaman from the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> staff and a number of people
                            from CAMG. We had understood the function of the Working Group to be to
                            decide exactly what purposes are served by the United States forces in
                            the Ryukyus and then to determine to what extent those purposes could be
                            achieved otherwise than through the continuation of the present
                            situation. However, the Defense position has been an inflexible
                            presentation of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> viewpoint. They
                            insist that United States retention in the present status of all of the
                            Ryukyus and Bonins is essential to our strategic interests. They suggest
                            a Presidential statement to declare, along with miscellaneous propaganda
                            material, that we will not seek a trusteeship but will <pb xml:id="pg_1377" n="1377" facs="0321"/>continue our administration
                            of the islands “until conditions of peace and security have once more
                            been restored to the Far East.”</p>
                        <p>Our efforts in the Working Group have therefore been somewhat confined.
                            We have attempted to explore the exact reasons for the Defense position
                            and have had some fairly frank discussions of the question of the
                            strategic necessity for the retention of specific islands, concentrating
                            especially on the Amami Oshima group and the Bonins. Actually, much of
                            the Defense position with respect to these islands rests upon the
                            administrative inconvenience of having to negotiate for rights with a
                            foreign government. We have also tried to persuade Defense to proceed at
                            once with a revision of the basic directive for the Ryukyus, designed to
                            achieve an administration which would be less of a military occupation
                            and which would place increasing responsibilities on the local
                            inhabitants. In this connection, the Budget Bureau letters<note n="1" xml:id="d625fn1">Apparently two letters of Dec. 2, neither found in
                                Department of State files. However, the letter to the Department of
                                Defense is quoted in Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName>’s reply of Jan. 7 to <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Lawton</persName>, as follows: “I refer to
                                your letter dated 2 December 1952 in which you requested ‘that the
                                Department of Defense, with the collaboration of the Department of
                                State, review the problems of the United States in acting as the
                                sole administering authority over the Ryukyu Islands, and propose
                                such measures as may be determined to be appropriate.’” In the
                                remainder of his letter, <persName corresp="#p_FWC1">Foster</persName> reviewed his Department’s thinking on the
                                subject and the activity of the State–Defense Working Group. He
                                stated that the Office of Civil Affairs and Military Government [in
                                the. Department of the Army] was preparing a revised directive for
                                the civil administration of the Ryukyus. He concluded: “When the
                                joint State–Defense working group has completed its study of the
                                disposition of the Ryukyu and Bonin-Volcano Islands and the new
                                directive for administration of the Islands is completed, I shall

                            useful support, although the nature of the Defense Department response
                                (attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d625fn2">See <ref target="#d625fn1">footnote 1</ref> above.</note> indicates something of their
                            inflexibility.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime we have asked for the views of the Embassy, which were
                            given to us in a lengthy despatch, No. 871 of November 4.<note n="3" xml:id="d625fn3">Not printed. (794C.0221/11–452)</note> The
                            recommendations at the conclusion of this memorandum are generally in
                            accord with the Embassy’s views.</p>
                        <p>Our present thinking is that it will not be fruitful to explore the
                            matter much further in the Working Group. We are consequently preparing
                            a paper to serve as the basis for securing a Department position which
                            can then be discussed with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> or
                            with the Department of Defense. If this reopening of the question does
                            not produce a satisfactory outcome, we believe that the question carries
                            sufficient political importance to warrant its being presented to the
                            President. In summary, our memorandum will probably make the following
                            recommendations:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1378" n="1378" facs="0322"/>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. The Amami Oshima group and the Bonins should be returned to
                                Japan at a time in the near future to be selected with an eye to
                                achieving the maximum political advantage for the United States. The
                                return should be preceded by an agreement with the Japanese
                                Government guaranteeing the rights we need on the islands to be
                                returned. We might also secure a commitment from the Japanese
                                Government to undertake a public information campaign in support of
                                United States purposes in retaining jurisdiction over some of the
                                islands.</item>
                            <item>We are not convinced of the strategic necessity for the retention
                                of the Amami Oshima group; and we understand that some people in
                                Defense may agree with us, just as <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> representatives “reluctantly conceded that Amami
                                Oshima and some of its surrounding islands could possibly be
                                returned to Japanese control without serious strategic loss if
                                political necessity required this move.” There is more question
                                about the Bonins because of a submarine base on one of those
                                islands; however, we think that our position should be to recommend
                                they be returned to Japan. In any event, we should insist upon
                                permission for the Bonin islanders to return.</item>
                            <item>2. At the time of the joint Japanese-United States announcement of
                                the return of the Amami Oshima group and the Bonins, there should be
                                a carefully worked out public statement by the President of the
                                United States. This statement would announce the return, reaffirm
                                Japanese residual sovereignty and explain in guarded fashion the
                                basic reasons for United States retention of some of the
                                islands.</item>
                            <item>3. Immediate steps should be taken to issue a revised directive
                                for the Ryukyus and to increase the degree of
                                self-government.</item>
                            <item>4. Retention of United States control over Okinawa on a longterm
                                basis is essential to United States security requirements in the Far
                                East. Exclusive United States right to use Okinawa also is required
                                on a long-term basis in case Japan one day restricts United States
                                military facilities in Japan or adopts a position of
                                neutrality.</item>

                            determination to take proper measures for self-defense. Accordingly I

                            Joint Chiefs of Staff, in which he concurred that “Japan be considered
                            eligible for grant and reimbursable military assistance in accordance
                            with the provisions of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, as
                            amended, and of the Mutual Security Act of 1951, as amended,” and
                            requested that you forward to the Director for Mutual Security a joint
                            recommendation by the two Departments to that effect if you concurred
                            from the political point of view.</p>
                        <p>Section 511 (a) of the Mutual Security Act of 1951, as amended, provides
                            in substance that no aid authorized pursuant to this Act (other than
                            reimbursable assistance provided under section 408 (e) of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>) shall be supplied to any nation

                            ultimate intent of the proposal, it questioned the advisability of
                            requesting a determination under Section 511 (a) at this time since (1)
                            Japan is not scheduled to receive grant military assistance under the
                            Mutual Security Program during the current fiscal year; (2) at present
                            military assistance to Japan is being financed by funds appropriated to
                            the Department of the Army to which the Mutual Security Legislation is
                            inapplicable; and (3) transfers of military equipment on a reimbursable
                            basis are specifically exempt from the requirements of Section 511 (a).
                            Therefore, no purpose would be served by such a determination at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>As a result conversations were held with officers in the Department of
                            Defense with a view to clarifying the proposal contained in Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LRA1">Lovett</persName>’s letter. It has been
                            agreed by the two departments that the proposed recommendation is
                            premature and that no action should be taken at this time.</p>
                        <p>There is, therefore, attached for your signature a proposed letter to the
                            Secretary of Defense formalizing this understanding.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum is submitted in accordance with your request for
                            information on the public relations aspects of United States
                            negotiations with Japan on export security controls and for

                            Members of Congress. We may expect inquiries on this subject as the
                            result of stories such as the brief item on the United Press ticker on
                            January 31 stating that the Japanese Government had announced that, as a
                            result of negotiations with the United States, agreement had been
                            reached that ninety previously embargoed items could now be exported to
                            Communist China.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>Under the bilateral agreement concerning the control of exports to
                            Communist China, signed at Washington on September 5, 1952<note n="1" xml:id="d629fn1">See circular telegram 321, <ref target="#d599">Document 599</ref>.</note> by representatives of the Department
                            of State and the Japanese Embassy, Japan agreed to embargo all
                            commodities included in the International Control Lists and the United
                            States Control Lists. The specific controls to be applied to other items
                            considered to be of strategic importance to Communist China was left for
                            subsequent negotiation between representatives of the Foreign Office and
                            our Embassy at Tokyo. These negotiations are now underway.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations at Washington which led up to the bilateral agreement,
                            the existence of the agreement, and the current negotiations in Tokyo
                            have been treated as secret by both this Government and the Japanese
                            Government. Unexpected delays have occurred, however, in securing a
                            coordinated United States Government position on the list of items under
                            negotiation and it has probably become increasingly difficult for the
                            Japanese Government to maintain the fiction that it is not consulting
                            with this Government on export control policy. Approximately a month
                            ago, however, the Chief of the Economic Affairs Bureau of the Foreign
                            Office assured our Embassy (Tokyo’s despatch No. 1252, January 2)<note n="2" xml:id="d629fn2">Not printed. (493.949/1–253)</note> that in
                            announcing the relaxation of controls on agreed items, <pb xml:id="pg_1383" n="1383" facs="0327"/>every effort would be made to
                            avoid any connection with, or mention of the existence of, the bilateral
                            agreement. In reporting the appearance of an article in the <hi rend="italic">Nippon Times</hi> referring to United States “consent”
                            to the relaxation of controls on specified items, our Embassy commented
                            (Tokyo’s No. 2225, January 12)<note n="3" xml:id="d629fn3">Not printed.
                                (493.949/1–1253)</note> that the story appeared to be a leak which
                            occurred in spite of Foreign Office precautions.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the bilateral negotiations, the Japanese representatives
                            stated that the Japanese Government would probably find it advisable to
                            make a statement in the Diet on its export control policy. To our
                            knowledge no such statement has been made. It may be expected, however,
                            that the question of United States influence on Japanese export control
                            policy may now be raised in the Diet.</p>
                        <p>Basically we have received fine cooperation from the Japanese Government
                            with regard to export security controls. The controls exercised by the
                            Japanese are more stringent than those of any other country except the
                            United States and Canada. Of the 400 items originally submitted to the
                            Japanese as the basis for the negotiations at Tokyo, the Japanese
                            accepted approximately 280 without question, reducing the area of
                            negotiation to the remaining 120 items. Interagency agreement has not
                            yet been obtained on 40 of these items due to the preoccupation of
                            Department of Commerce technicians with other matters. With regard to
                            the balance of approximately 80 items, our Embassy has been authorized
                            to agree to quantitative controls instead of embargo on approximately
                            twothirds and has been asked to press for continued embargo on the
                            remaining one-third.</p>

                        <p>In his memorandum of a conversation held with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> on February 4, <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> reported on <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>’s views regarding several East

                                problem of rearmament in Japan and expressed the belief that the
                                Army was pushing the Japanese too fast toward rearmament. He felt it
                                was necessary, and said he had told Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Fechteler</persName>, that <pb xml:id="pg_1384" n="1384" facs="0328"/>in bringing about the
                                rearmament of Japan it should be kept in line with the development
                                of Chinese forces on Formosa as well as Korean forces so that Japan
                                would not be in a position of definite dominance over these
                                countries. In his opinion, while it was important that the Japanese
                                be on our side and while we should do everything possible to
                                encourage this, we should have no illusions about the fact that the
                                Japanese were interested first in their own concerns and that we
                                should not put all our eggs in one basket and depend solely on the
                                Japanese as our only friend with power in Asia.”

                            months on part of Japanese Government stubborn wait-and-see attitude
                            which seems to be based on following considerations: (1) Japanese
                            domestic politics; (2) desire to know more about policy of new US
                            administration; (3) determination to keep Japanese expenditures to
                            minimum on theory that US so acutely concerned about defense that in
                            last analysis US will supply deficiencies; (4) ignorance on part of most
                            leaders in Japanese Government regarding high costs of modern defense
                            establishment and apparently no appreciation of time-lag factor between
                            planning and being able to place modern equipment and trained men in
                            readiness; (5) desire to explore in detail question of Japanese

                                billion yen was for support of U.S. security forces.
                                (794.5/1–1352)</note> but this increase may be apparent rather than
                            real because it includes yen 18 billion planned for vessel construction
                            for coastal safety force. There is possibility that this item may be
                            eliminated as it will be subjected to considerable discussion and attack
                            in Diet.</p>
                        <p>As indication of Japanese reluctance provide necessary budgetary support
                            for <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss> even at current retarded level
                            of 110,000, FCC points out that current budget proposed for fiscal year
                            1953–1954 yen 56 billions in place of minimum yen 99.6 billions which
                                <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> estimates as necessary.</p>
                        <p>On the political scene we cannot rule out possibility of realignment of
                            conservative leadership in such way as to provide more realistic
                            treatment of national defense needs. There is also possibility that
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s “gradual approach”
                            formula to rearmament may find political climate propitious later in
                            year to permit increase of <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss> ceiling
                            from 110,000 to 150,000 which would require supplemental defense budget.
                            At present this appears doubtful. While foregoing does not lead us to
                            expect any form of request for military assistance from Japan in
                            immediate future, General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>
                            and I have Embassy-<gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> consultative
                            group working on form which such military assistance might eventually
                            take so that when and if political picture changes, we will not be found
                            lacking a plan but would be in position to present to Japan carefully
                            worked out plan as basis for assistance program. As work of this group
                            takes shape, it will be submitted to Department for comments.</p>
                        <p>Objective of such planning should be an agreed position which both US and
                            Japan can accept as guide for cooperative action; otherwise US financial
                            support might conceivably fail and Japanese Diet on other hand could
                            intervene to defeat program perhaps at critical juncture. This seems to
                            add up to need for frank discussion with Japanese Government at
                            propitious moment which would probably have to include understanding
                            regarding disposition of article 9 of Japanese constitution in effort to
                            conclude an agreement on military assistance.</p>

                            and financial as well as military experts and possible wider initial
                            understanding and support could be obtained by their participation at

                        <p>I would appreciate benefit of Department’s thinking and advice because I
                            believe that present irregular arrangement should not be prolonged if
                            for no other reason than it gives Japanese Government greater leverage
                            in extracting from us larger concessions.</p>

                            hostilities in Korea obviously as Japan is not party, but what is
                            contemplated is matters such as question of eventual bombing of points
                            in Manchuria.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned fact that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> some
                            weeks ago had expressed desire to have tripartite talks in Tokyo (see
                                <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 1977). <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> replied that this is same idea
                            brought up to date. He explained that after mentioning idea to me,
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had also asked him to
                            broach subject to British Ambassador but that latter had been
                            unresponsive. He said that idea would be to have discussion among
                            representatives <pb xml:id="pg_1387" n="1387" facs="0331"/>with
                            authority to speak freely although not necessarily making commitments of
                            any kind. In their opinion, he said, Ambassador Dening not suitable
                            because of his supercaution and tendency to stick well within letter of
                            his instructions. Perhaps, he said, Washington would be better place
                            than Tokyo but they preferred Tokyo. If necessary, he could go to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>I said that I would report what he said to Department and that due to
                            change of administration obviously Department had not had opportunity to
                            consider idea as yet. Of course, there would be reservations to such a
                            plan stemming from other interested countries, I said, and added that
                            naturally we are always eager to have benefit Japanese views and
                            certainly want them to understand ours.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> then launched into review
                            of Japanese experiences with blockade of Chinese coast and difficulties
                            which arose re control of land frontiers. At present, he declared,
                            coastal blockade would emphasize importance and increase Communist
                            Chinese reliance on volume of supplies from <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Flow of goods over Thailand, Burma and India would
                            increase. He assumed blockade would apply to ports of Dairen and Port
                            Arthur but not to Vladivostok. Hong Kong, he said, is a two-way street
                            useful both to Chinese and outside world which lives by smuggling.
                            Imposition of blockade would not necessarily mean Chinese occupation of
                            Hong Kong. He discounted Chinese Nationalists strength to make
                            large-scale landings on mainland, saying he felt Chinese Nationalist
                            potential limited to small landing parties able to hold very limited
                            territory for five or six days and that only possible with American aid.
                            He asserted Japanese Government believes there would be many defections
                            of individual members of Chinese Nationalist landing parties if
                            attempted on large scale. He said this would be true especially of
                            soldiers and aviators in the older age brackets, men aged 28 or 29
                            because of family ties. He also stressed that Japanese Government
                            believes Chinese Nationalist Forces’ reputation not good in many regions
                            China mainland because of extortion allegedly practiced by them at time
                            their departure from area. He referred frequently to Japanese
                            experiences in occupation portions China requiring ever deeper
                            penetration of territory with accompanying headaches of supply,
                            especially foodstuffs for millions of people. He seemed to assume that
                            Chinese Nationalist Forces would be as unpopular with Chinese people as
                            were Japanese.</p>
                        <p>This is first time that <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> has
                            spoken to me in this vein reference China. He said there had been some
                            discussions in Cabinet on subject but I am uncertain of his reason for
                            stressing the problem now except perhaps as prelude to suggested
                            tripartite talks.</p>

                                        contained some information on U.S. views on the topics
                                        mentioned in paragraph 1 of this memorandum, which was to be
                                        given the Japanese Government along with the following
                                        comment on the question of talks: “US interested discussions

                                        international issues which directly or indirectly affect
                                        Japan. Because of desirability frequent and continuing
                                        discussion with highest officials Japanese Government seems
                                        preferable as Japanese suggest such discussions take place

                        </p>
                        <p>From various indications, including comments in the Diet by members of
                            the opposition and of the Liberal Party, we are sure that what the
                            Japanese have in mind is a desire to be consulted in advance by the
                            United States before any major steps, such as the bombing of Manchurian
                            air bases, which might possibly bring retaliation from the Communists of
                            a nature to involve Japan directly. Clearly, we can not commit ourselves
                            to such advance consultations. However, we are anxious to the greatest
                            extent possible to develop mutual discussions with the Japanese of these
                            larger issues. Doing so will give them a sense of participation in the
                            struggle against Communism and will also, we hope, help to move them to
                            take more effective measures to contribute to their own defense.</p>
                        <p>We have, therefore, drafted the attached telegram which gives
                            encouragement to the general idea of frequent high-level discussions
                            with the Japanese on such questions but recommends that they be kept to
                            a bilateral basis and that they be held in Tokyo. In <pb xml:id="pg_1389" n="1389" facs="0333"/>commenting on the specific
                            questions raised by the Japanese we have in general followed the

                        <p>The Korean Foreign Minister opened by stating that he felt that something
                            was coming in Korea, that this was his hope and his feeling. He stated
                            that he and his people were anxious to see a military advance made
                            there. He also stated that they were anxious to have an international
                            assurance that they would be included in a mutual defense pact for the
                            Far Eastern area, including the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>
                            countries. He expressed fear that the Japanese still harbored the desire
                            ultimately to take over Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Korean Foreign Minister stated that the Japanese were anxious to
                            conclude a nationality pact which would permit them a free hand in the
                            deportation of Korean residents in Japan and that they also desired to
                            enter into a commercial pact which would give the Japanese special
                            trading advantages in Korea. The Foreign Minister stated that Korea
                            could not allow either such pact. He <pb xml:id="pg_1390" n="1390" facs="0334"/>also stated that his government was very anxious that
                            there should not be many Japanese nationals living in Korea doing
                            business there, that large numbers of Japanese nationals in Korea during
                            a time of hostilities represented a great danger.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that without adequate trade the Japanese were
                            bound to suffer economic strangulation which would result in their
                            almost certainly turning to the Communist side. He said that Korea would
                            do well to balance these risks against the fear that the Foreign
                            Minister had expressed of the Japanese domination of Korean trade.</p>
                        <p>The Korean Foreign Minister brought up the issue of fishing rights. He
                            expressed himself very strongly on the fear of Japan’s being able to
                            take over Korean fishing grounds while the Koreans were waging war. The
                            Secretary stated that the problem of fishing rights was a worldwide
                            problem, that in general the U.S. position was based on the premise,
                            that there could be no preemption of fishing grounds beyond the
                            three-mile limit. There was then some discussion of the salmon pact. The
                            Korean Foreign Minister terminated the appointment by stating that the
                            Japanese fishing fleets were at this time forcefully fishing in Korean
                            waters and had refused to continue negotiations on this matter.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>The Security Treaty between the United States and Japan is based on the
                            expectation that “Japan will itself increasingly assume responsibility
                            for its own defense”. While some progress has been made in the
                            development of Japan’s defense forces, the Japanese Government has been
                            reluctant, for political and economic reasons, to press consistently for
                            rearmament. Progress to date falls short of previous United States
                            expectations.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Diet has authorized a strength for the National Safety Force
                            (ground forces) of 110,000. Approximately 100,000 men are now in
                            uniform. The United States has equipped those forces with both heavy and
                            light equipment. Sixty-eight United States <pb xml:id="pg_1393" n="1393" facs="0337"/>Coast Guard-type vessels are in the process of being
                            transferred to the Japanese Coastal Safety Force. In addition, the
                            Coastal Safety Force is operating forty Japanese World War II
                            minesweepers. Japan has no air force.</p>
                        <p>United States plans envisage the development by Japan of a balanced
                            ten-division ground force (total strength of 325,000) and defensive air
                            and naval arms. United States views with respect to the ultimate
                            strength of Japan’s forces have not been revealed to the Japanese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>A total of $528 million has been made available through Army
                            appropriations for equipping the Japanese ground force. Under these
                            appropriations, special Presidential authorization was given for loaning
                            equipment to the Japanese, and to date about $80 million worth of
                            equipment has been loaned and an additional $170 million programmed.
                            These amounts are approximately enough to take care of the present
                            110,000 man force through Fiscal Year 1953. The total of $528 million is
                            estimated to be enough to provide for a six-division (180,000 men)
                            force. The Department of Defense is proposing to introduce legislation
                            into the present session of Congress authorizing the transfer of this
                            equipment to the Japanese. It is expected that additional funds of up to
                            $150 million, a major part of which will be for aircraft procurement,
                            will be included in the Fiscal Year 1954 Mutual Security Program.
                            Because of the long lead-time on aircraft, they will not be available
                            for transfer to the Japanese before 1956. Since military assistance to
                            Japan has to date been financed by Army appropriations, no bilateral
                            agreement under Mutual Security legislation has been required; such an
                            agreement will be required before equipment or services can be provided
                            Japan under the Fiscal Year 1954 Mutual Security Program.
                            Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a recent
                            conversation with Embassy officials, expressed a desire to begin
                            discussions of a bilateral military assistance agreement.</p>
                        <p>A Joint (Military) Planning Board has been established in Japan to
                            consider questions of combined command, disposition of forces, and other
                            military matters. However, there is no formal mechanism for joint
                            consideration of the political and economic aspects of rearmament, and
                            the Joint Planning Board has as yet achieved little in the way of
                            concrete results. Some of the Japanese have emphasized that two major
                            obstacles to Japanese rearmament are the lack of information in the
                            Japanese Government as to the policies and long-range objectives of the
                            United States with respect to Japanese rearmament and a lack of genuine
                            mutuality in approach to this problem.</p>

                            government which may jeopardize its position and result in longer delays
                            in the defense buildup. The rearmament question was discussed with Iseki
                            by Defense and State officials during his recent visit to Washington. He
                            indicated that the major obstacles to the Japanese rearmament program
                            are lack of information in the Japanese Government regarding long-range
                            United <pb xml:id="pg_1395" n="1395" facs="0339"/>States military
                            objectives in Japan and lack of mutuality in the approach to the
                            Japanese rearmament problem generally. His view, which the Department
                            shares, is that the Joint Planning Group is an inadequate instrument for
                            joint military planning and that the terms of reference and the
                            representation on both sides must be enlarged if the military and
                            related economic and political problems are to get adequate
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>In view of the desirability of obtaining maximum Japanese Government
                            understanding of, and participation in, the defense program for the
                            Japan area, it is considered advisable that you and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> continue the discussions with the
                            Japanese Government regarding the long-range United States military
                            objectives in Japan. Conversations should cover the overall defense
                            problem, including a statement of the United States military policy
                            vis-à-vis Japan, force goals, objectives with respect to the production
                            of military goods in Japan, military assistance, and a joint planning
                            organization. Subject to your and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> comments, these discussions should include the
                            following points:</p>

                            <item>1. Basic Policy Objective. The United States policy is to assist
                                Japan to develop balanced ground, sea and air forces which
                                ultimately will be capable of assuming responsibility for the

                                Defense is sending out a concurrent telegram which will contain this
                                information. As to timing, you should indicate the time lag in the
                                production of aircraft and other heavy equipment, but stress the
                                possibility of beginning the training of pilots and technical
                                personnel as soon as the Japanese Government is ready. You are urged
                                to stress the utmost importance of maintaining the secrecy of your
                                disclosure to the Japanese Government of United States views with
                                respect to the Japanese military force.</item>
                            <item>The Japanese Government should be to consider these goals in
                                detail, to discuss them jointly with you and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> in the light of their own
                                thinking, and to work out mutually acceptable plans for the
                                development of their defense forces, including the time schedule for
                                the achievement of force goals and for the transfer of
                                responsibilities. Emphasis should beplaced on the development of
                                joint long-range plans. Although it is considered highly desirable
                                to negotiate a formal written agreement along the lines of the
                                recommendations in your telegram 2642 and including the section 511
                                (a) assurances, such written agreement is not actually required by
                                law until goods or services are delivered to the Japanese under the
                                Mutual Security Program. Therefore, from a legal point <pb xml:id="pg_1396" n="1396" facs="0340"/>of view, a written
                                agreement is not required for several months, although negotiations
                                can take place at an earlier date if politically feasible. In any
                                event, the first step is to lay United States plans and objectives
                                before the Japanese and establish a forum which can discuss and
                                reach agreement on these basic policy questions. The Department’s
                                comments on your proposed mutual defense assistance agreement, which
                                were contained in your telegram 2795,<note n="3" xml:id="d637fn3">Dated Feb. 27, not printed. (794.5 <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/2–2753)</note> will be forwarded soon. The
                                agreement as to force goals and timing, joint command, transfer of
                                responsibilities, etc., can be handled in a separate classified
                                document. The need for consistency with agreements with other
                                countries and the interest of other Washington agencies necessitate
                                prior clearance of such agreement in Washington.</item>
                            <item>3. United States Assistance. In the interest of the collective
                                security of the free world, the United States is prepared to assist
                                Japan, subject to Congressional authorization, in the development of
                                its forces on a basis comparable to the assistance being provided
                                other governments. At whatever point in these continuing discussions
                                you consider that it is desirable, the Japanese Government may be
                                informed that up to $500 million worth of equipment can be made
                                available for Japanese ground forces under Army appropriations
                                already made. This includes the equipment already loaned to the
                                National Safety Forces. Legislation is being prepared which will
                                authorize the transfer of the equipment already loaned and of
                                additional equipment as required. In addition, the Fiscal Year 1954
                                Mutual Security Program may propose that Congress authorize the
                                expenditure of additional funds, including funds for aircraft
                                procurement. Action by Congress on legislation and decisions with
                                respect to actual turnover of equipment to the National Safety
                                Forces will be influenced by the decisions of the Japanese
                                Government on its own program for defense.</item>
                            <item>It is imperative that no commitments, either expressed or implied,
                                should be made to the Japanese Government regarding the size and
                                nature of possible future military assistance programs. The
                                conversations should be on the order of magnitude, and it should be
                                emphasized that the aid program figures are tentative and used as a
                                basis for discussion only. It should be pointed out, however, that
                                effective planning and Congressional presentation of these programs
                                require: (1) a joint understanding as to force goals, time-phasing,
                                and equipment requirements; (2) an analysis of Japan’s capacity to
                                produce or finance such equipment; and (3) an analysis of the total
                                defense burden which Japan is capable of assuming. The Fiscal Year
                                1954 Program is still uncertain. For your information only, it is
                                expected to provide a maximum of $150 million new funds, with the
                                bulk going for aircraft procurement.</item>
                            <item>4. Defense Production. The United States desires to assist Japan
                                in the development of its capacity to produce military equipment and
                                supplies, the production of which in Japan is determined to be in
                                the mutual interest of both Japan and the United States. The United
                                States desires to discuss with Japan its military production
                                potentialities and its problems associated with such production. It
                                    <pb xml:id="pg_1397" n="1397" facs="0341"/>is essential that
                                Japan be, within the limits of strategic considerations and its
                                capacity to finance, able to produce in Japan the maximum share of
                                her needs. It should be stressed that discussion of this problem
                                would be greatly facilitated by a joint agreement on long-term
                                military objectives, timing and equipment requirements. The United
                                States will assist in this development through the provision of
                                technical assistance, off-shore procurement, and other means
                                consistent with strategic and other considerations and where
                                necessary to supplement Japan’s own efforts. In view of the present
                                uncertainty of the future off-shore procurement program, this
                                program should not be unduly stressed.</item>

                                in the penultimate paragraph of your telegram 2642, to your

                        <p>For your information, State intends to discuss the Japanese rearmament

                            an effort to allay fears of the creation of a Japanese military force of
                            aggressive potentialities. These discussions will stress the defensive
                            character and general size limitations of the planned forces, the
                            economic limitations of Japanese rearmament, the Security Treaty which
                            permits the stationing of United States forces in and around Japan, and
                            United States security treaties with other governments.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy paper on Japan, which was
                            approved by the President on August 7, 1952, left unresolved the
                            question of the disposition of the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands as a result
                            of a difference of opinion between State and Defense. Subsequent
                            extensive staff discussions have revealed no change in the Defense
                            position, the <pb xml:id="pg_1398" n="1398" facs="0342"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> having determined that retention of all
                            of these islands in their present status is essential to United States
                            strategic interests.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the reporting from the Embassy on this subject and the
                            detailed discussion with Defense of the strategic factors involved, we
                            have reached the following tentative conclusions.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. It would be undesirable to apply for a trusteeship. Not only
                                would there be numerous difficulties created by United Nations
                                requirements, but the application would intensify our political
                                problem with the Japanese, who would regard this action as a step
                                away from the return of sovereignty to them. Defense concurs in this
                                position.</item>
                            <item>2. On the islands and in Japan the question of their status
                                remains an acute political issue aggravated by the fact that an
                                inadequate job is being done for the inhabitants in such important
                                areas as education. The issue is most acute with respect to the
                                Amami group, which, both racially and politically, has been more
                                closely tied to Japan.</item>
                            <item>3. As our main military base in the Far East, and as the base from
                                which our long-range strategic bombers operate, Okinawa is of such
                                major strategic importance that we should retain it in its present
                                status while the tensions in the Far East continue. This has
                                advantages for the Japanese, too, since it will enable them to
                                disclaim responsibility if we should have to utilize the base for
                                operations in Indochina and on the mainland of China.</item>
                            <item>4. The Bonin Islands include a submarine base, but the case for
                                the strategic necessity for their retention is weaker than for
                                Okinawa. In addition, approximately 7,000 former inhabitants of the
                                islands who were evacuated during the war and want to return,
                                constitute a political problem. The Navy has been unwilling, for
                                security and economic reasons, to allow them to return.</item>
                            <item>5. The strategic factors are least important for the Amami group.
                                The only military considerations appear to be the necessity for
                                stations which will form part of the radar warning network and the
                                existence there of the best typhoon anchorage in the area. These
                                problems could readily be handled by agreement with the Japanese
                                whenever it is decided to return these islands to Japanese
                                administration.</item>
                            <item>6. There is an urgent necessity for an improved civil affairs
                                directive which will make possible more adequate administration of
                                the islands over which we retain control, which will give an
                                increasing degree of self-government to the inhabitants, and which
                                will allow the Japanese to perform certain functions, such as the
                                provision of consular services for Ryukyuans travelling abroad. The
                                Bureau of the Budget is interested in this problem, and has urged
                                reconsideration of the present arrangements. Defense is prepared to
                                proceed with a modification of the present civil affairs directive
                                as soon as the basic policy question is settled.</item>

                                right now because of the electoral campaign. He has mentioned the
                                matter to me three times in the past week, the last time being
                                yesterday when he lunched with me. He urges that some encouraging
                                word be said by the United States at this time. He obviously wishes
                                to demonstrate that the Japanese Foreign Office is not being
                                negligent or dilatory regarding this important question. Quite apart
                                from the electoral campaign the issue is an important one in the

                            informed us of their reluctance to have us yield our control over the

                            alteration in the present situation. Although this question is likely to
                            be a hot domestic political issue in both countries, we think that the
                            problem will be reduced to manageable proportions if we retain control

                                    <item>(c) The Amami group should be returned to Japan at an

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken</persName>: You will recall that
                            during your recent visit to Japan you had an opportunity to discuss with
                            some of my officers the over-all problem of criminal jurisdiction, to
                            speak to Japanese Government officials about this matter, and to observe
                            one of our frequent meetings with the Commonwealth Chiefs of Missions in
                            Tokyo, where the subject was also discussed in connection with the
                            current negotiations for an agreement to cover the United Nations forces
                            in Japan. As a result of your talks with those persons in the <pb xml:id="pg_1401" n="1401" facs="0345"/>field intimately concerned
                            with this problem, I feel sure you left Tokyo with a greater
                            understanding of the seriousness of the situation and its possible
                            significance on future United States–Japanese relations. You will
                            undoubtedly be kept informed of the situation as it develops,
                            particularly with regard to Japanese reactions which should make
                            themselves known during the election campaign in Japan. I wish, however,
                            on the eve of my departure to set forth several considerations which
                            have occurred to me in the hope that they may serve some useful purpose
                            in dealing with the problem as we approach the April 28 deadline,<note n="2" xml:id="d639fn2">Article XVII provided that if the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of Forces Agreement had
                                not gone into effect within one year of the effective date of the
                                Administrative Agreement, the United States would at the request of
                                Japan reconsider the question of criminal jurisdiction over U.S.
                                official personnel and their dependents. Documents in file 611.94
                                for 1953 indicate that the Japanese Government instead chose to
                                await the entry into force of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Agreement, which took place on Aug. 23,
                                1953.</note> when the Japanese are certain to request
                            reconsideration of Article 17 of the Administrative Agreement.</p>
                        <p>In the first place we are faced with the Japanese emotional factor. The
                            Japanese, and I refer to various levels of responsible Japanese opinion
                            in and out of government, do not always approach the problem
                            realistically. They will admit quite frankly that the jurisdiction issue
                            is a question of “national sentiment,” and do not appear able to face
                            the issue on a practical basis. Persons who should know better talk in
                            terms of extra-territoriality and loss of sovereignty even though we
                            have repeatedly pointed out that these concepts are not involved.
                            Nevertheless, the press and Diet members are disinclined to re-orient
                            their thinking.</p>
                        <p>Second, the Japanese are convinced that the present state of
                            international law supports their position for split jurisdiction along
                            the lines of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula, and they
                            refer constantly to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Agreement
                            as their authority for this view. Even though the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Agreement may never come into force,
                            they contend that it still represents the prevailing views and
                            considered judgments of those statesmen who signed that treaty. They
                            feel that they can accept this internationally-approved formula without
                            loss of prestige and without injury to their “national sentiment”. They
                            are familiar with the fact that the <persName corresp="#p_THS1">Truman</persName> Administration supported the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula and that the present
                            Administration on February 27 also urged Senate ratification. This
                            situation makes it difficult for us to discuss with the Japanese the
                            international law on the subject, which is by no means uniform.</p>
                        <p>Third, criminal jurisdiction in Japan is a political football, with the
                            Japanese apparently more interested in kicking the ball than in running
                            with it. If there is any one thing that all political parties <pb xml:id="pg_1402" n="1402" facs="0346"/>are agreed upon it is the
                            desire for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> split jurisdiction
                            arrangement. I would venture to say that if a Japanese in political
                            affairs should undertake to espouse United States exclusive
                            jurisdiction, his career would be in jeopardy. Thus, at a time when
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> appeared to have
                            complete control of a majority in the Diet, he did not dare to take to
                            the Diet the issue of exclusive jurisdiction for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> forces in Japan; and I have yet to see
                            any evidence that any political or governmental group is prepared to
                            sponsor such jurisdiction at this time or in the future. It is my
                            impression also that many important Japanese bureaucrats, including
                            those dealing with the Administrative Agreement, feel strongly that
                            Japan should fight for the split jurisdiction formula.</p>
                        <p>As a final consideration, I need not remind you that the die was cast in
                            the Administrative Agreement negotiations when we promised to give the
                            Japanese <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> treatment upon Senate
                            ratification or else to reconsider the subject after April 28 of this
                            year. This they consider an implied promise to turn over some
                            jurisdiction to them, and they would undoubtedly consider a refusal to
                            give way as a breach of good faith.</p>
                        <p>There may be a number of explanations for these Japanese attitudes. I
                            would explain them by saying that they are the reaction to the many
                            years of occupation, and also a reassertion of the national pride of a
                            sensitive people. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>
                            recognizes this, and I am sure others in government office have the same
                            feelings. Last fall <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> told
                            me, with reference to the question of jurisdiction, that the Japanese
                            are a people suffering from an inferiority complex which is reflected in
                            their strong desire to exercise jurisdiction in the present
                            instance.</p>
                        <p>What then is the solution—what should we do? Obviously the simplest
                            answer is U.S. ratification of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Agreement. In the event, however, that the Senate does not ratify <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, or else tables the treaty
                            indefinitely, we will be faced with a decision which will have to be
                            measured in terms of the relative merits of military exigence versus
                            political prudence. At this point, I don’t believe that the Japanese
                            will give up easily, and I think it would be dangerous for us to apply
                            such pressure on them as might conceivably obtain our objectives on
                            criminal jurisdiction at the expense of alienating the friendly Japanese
                            relationships and popular support, which are so essential for the
                            successful mission of our forces in Japan. I can think of nothing short
                            of re-enactment of the Asiatic exclusion law that would be more
                            calculated to arouse the resentment of all classes of Japanese.</p>
                        <p>In the event the Senate ratifies <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            the Japanese will most certainly ask for similar treatment, and, under
                            the terms of the Administrative Agreement, apparently are entitled to
                            get it. This <pb xml:id="pg_1403" n="1403" facs="0347"/>does not mean,
                            however, that the Japanese may not be willing in certain situations to
                            waive jurisdiction in our favor. Last September we had indications in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Agreement negotiations that the
                            Japanese were interested in exercising jurisdiction only in a limited
                            category of major offenses—five in all. Whether the Japanese would be so
                            inclined if they had the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula
                            is hard to say. If the Japanese are given jurisdiction over our troops
                            in Japan, they may make use of it for an initial period to assert their
                            authority and satisfy their so-called inferiority complex. Nevertheless,
                            I should expect that we would be in a position at the same time to
                            arrive at some working arrangement with the Japanese whereby they would
                            relinquish more and more of their jurisdiction on an informal basis,
                            other than by means of a written commitment, perhaps on the Provost
                            Marshal-Japanese police level.</p>
                        <p>Should the Senate disapprove of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or
                            pigeon-hole it, we can no longer use the argument with the Japanese that
                            the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> must be maintained so as not to
                            affect the chances of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s
                            ratification. The question then becomes wide open, and since the
                            Japanese know that the President and the Secretary are behind the split
                            jurisdiction formula, which can be granted in Japan without Senate
                            approval, our position becomes even more untenable. I realize of course
                            that a Senate rejection of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            formula would make it difficult to undertake any arrangements contrary
                            to the Senate’s policy, but the Japanese may not see it that way,
                            particularly when they learn that the United Kingdom will put into
                            effect the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> jurisdictional formula
                            on April 30, as part of its internal legislation, whether or not <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> comes into force. I don’t think the
                            Japanese will ever willingly continue to grant exclusive foreign
                            jurisdiction if the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula is in
                            force in Europe. The most we can hope for is a watered-down version of
                            the split jurisdiction, and I believe we can get it provided Europe
                            takes it as well. At least we ought to try for it.</p>
                        <p>Apparently, there has been some thought given to taking the position that
                            the existence of hostilities in Korea is cause for the retention of
                            exclusive jurisdiction by one means or another. This position would have
                            a great deal of merit if it were not for the fact that the Japanese
                            would consider it as an obvious attempt to circumvent the provisions of
                            the Administrative Agreement. These hostilities were in existence when
                            the U.S. committed itself either to grant <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> treatment or to reconsider criminal jurisdiction after
                            April 28, and although I was not present at the negotiations, I am
                            reliably informed that the “hostilities” concept was never considered or
                            discussed with the Japanese. Since the situation today is substantially
                            what it was last year in this respect, I do not believe that the Korean
                            hostilities offer us a sound basis for seeking retention <pb xml:id="pg_1404" n="1404" facs="0348"/>of exclusive jurisdiction. I
                            doubt the Japanese would concede that the hostilities in Korea justify
                            continued United States exclusive jurisdiction because of the
                            implication that Japan would be admitting a status of belligerency.
                            Under these circumstances, therefore, any attempt to hold on to
                            exclusive jurisdiction on the basis of hostilities in Korea presents a
                            situation of compounded difficulty.</p>
                        <p>In this discussion I wish to make my own position clear. Under the
                            Administrative Agreement the Japanese owed us at least one year of
                            exclusive jurisdiction without recrimination or regret in order that our
                            forces could readjust to the changed situation resulting from the Peace
                            Treaty. To this extent at least they had paid their debt although at
                            times with evident distaste on the part of the press and politicians.
                            However, in view of our present position and policy, both in Japan and
                            in Europe, it is difficult to see how we can withdraw from our implied
                            promise to split our jurisdiction with Japan. We might have obtained
                            more favorable treatment last year when the Japanese were willing to
                            give us a better version than <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We
                            may even be able to do it now, but with less possibility of success. The
                            Japanese consider criminal jurisdiction as one of the foremost problems
                            between the U.S. and Japan. There seems little doubt that if we press
                            for better treatment than we receive in Europe, we are in for
                            trouble.</p>
                        <p>We were delighted to have you visit with us, and I hope you enjoyed your
                            stay in Japan as much as we enjoyed having you. I look forward to our

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken</persName>: I lunched with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> on April 2 at his
                            house in Oiso and after lunch he handed me a confidential <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of which a copy is enclosed.</p>
                        <p>On March 24 he also wrote me a penned note, a copy of which is
                                enclosed.<note n="2" xml:id="d641fn2">Neither enclosure is
                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The three items which he mentions in these communications are very much
                            on his mind, viz., (1) a World Bank loan for power development; (2)
                            Japanese administration of Amami Oshima; and (3) release and/or
                            reduction of terms of Japanese war criminals.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know what, if anything, the Department can do about any of these,
                            and I gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> no
                            assurance that anything could be done while at the same time expressing
                            sympathy in these issues which are of obvious importance in the
                            electoral campaign.<note n="3" xml:id="d641fn3">Elections for the House

                            East, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said
                            that he had a query with respect to the proposed <pb xml:id="pg_1407" n="1407" facs="0351"/>policy on Japan.<note n="9" xml:id="d642fn9">The proposals in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/4 were
                                additional suggestions for the implementation of the “objectives”
                                stated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/2. Hence the
                                economic “objective” for Japan remained that stated in paragraph 6.c
                                of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/2.</note> Was it even
                            thinkable, inquired Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, that Japan can have a Viable economy if, for
                            the indefinite future and with a growing population, it was confined to
                            the home islands? In making this suggestion in the policy statement on
                            Japan, were we not simply kidding ourselves?</p>
                        <p>In reply to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> thought that it might
                            be possible to achieve the objective in question if certain trade
                            arrangements and developments in the Far East could be created. But Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> admitted that at best
                            it would be very difficult.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the belief that there was no future for Japan
                            unless access were provided for it to the markets and raw materials of
                            Manchuria and North China.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> returned to the
                            charge that on this point the policy statement did not seem practical,
                            and that the Council should take a new look at the problem.</p>
                        <p>Both the President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            noted the very great difficulty of trying to provide for a viable
                            Japanese economy in a few years. It would take a considerable time to
                            secure for Japan what it required to support its population and to
                            stabilize its economy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that the policy for Japan stated in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/4 might last for perhaps five years, but after that
                            no policy which separated Japan from the Asiatic mainland would be
                            practical.</p>
                        <p>The President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed with this statement, and the President
                            went further in saying that it was his own belief that even over the
                            short haul a certain amount of Japanese trade with Communist China
                            should be permitted in place of the complete embargo and blockade which
                            now existed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> added that the
                            United States ought now to be “aggressive” in order to see to it that
                            Japan and Germany secured a position in the world in which they would be
                            able to thrive and have scope for their virile populations. In some
                            respects, it seemed to him, we had licked the two wrong nations in the
                            last war.</p>
                        <p>The President said, “You don’t mean that; you mean we licked these two
                            nations too thoroughly.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the
                            view that it was not practicable to envisage any revival of Japanese
                            sovereignty and physical control over Manchuria, but we could do a lot
                            to assist Japan by encouraging Japanese trade with the Philippines and
                            Malaya. Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_1408" n="1408" facs="0352"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reviewed the history of the
                            Japanese economy since 1930, and concluded that the lesson to be learned
                            from this history was the possibility of a revival of Japanese trade
                            with the various free nations of Asia as at least a temporary substitute
                            for Japanese control of portions of the Chinese mainland. Certainly
                            something must be done to assist the Japanese to overcome the sense of
                            insecurity which they could not escape owing to the fact that their
                            markets and their sources of raw materials were so far distant from the
                            home islands. In the long run, moreover, the Japanese would have to have
                            access again to mainland areas like Manchuria.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> inquired whether the
                            Council wished to go further than this and adopt a policy which would
                            look to the restoration of Japan’s lost colonial empire. Such an idea,
                            he admitted, was not to be found in the present paper.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that we do not want to contemplate such a step, but
                            we did wish to open up new trade possibilities for Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> concluded the
                            discussion of Japan by saying that we would have to face the fact and
                            realize that we could not hope to keep Japan as a loyal ally of the West
                            if it became dependent economically on Communist China. Such dependence
                            would provide the Chinese Communists with a terrible club to hold over
                            Japan.</p><gap/>

                            The Embassy forwarded the Department’s telegram to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> who is in Formosa. The Embassy’s

                                Tokyo, Apr. 10, signed by Chargé William T. Turner, the Embassy
                                opposed intervention in the election on these grounds: there was not
                                sufficient time to take effective action, any successor government
                                would likely be pro-United States (whether or not headed by

                                might be a liability rather than an asset. Regarding a loan, the
                                Embassy considered “it would be ill-advised at this time to
                                dissipate bargaining power for any such dubious purposes.” (Attached

                        <p>2. We have discussed this matter carefully in the Office of Northeast
                            Asian Affairs from the political and economic point of view. We believe
                            that consideration should be given to making a policy declaration
                            regarding Japan’s economic viability and Japan’s fears of a sudden drop
                            in military procurement in the event of an armistice in Korea. My office
                            is now urgently preparing a draft statement for your consideration and
                            clearance with the Defense Department. I am also attaching a letter I
                            have just received from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> reporting his conversation with Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> on April 2, and
                            enclosing the same document which <pb xml:id="pg_1410" n="1410" facs="0354"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName>
                            handed you yesterday. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> does not see what the Department can do about any
                            of the Japanese Government’s requests. Of course he was not aware of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName>’s own suggestion
                            regarding a statement on U.S. procurement in Japan. Perhaps the
                            Ambassador will react differently than the Embassy to the Department’s
                            telegram of last night.</p>
                        <p>3. In the meantime, two Japanese officials have raised this matter with
                            me and urged a statement regarding U.S. willingness to help the Japanese
                            in their economic problem. Minister Watanabe, who is in charge of
                            financial matters in the Japanese Embassy, and Mr. Kono, who is Director
                            of the Bureau of the Budget in the Japanese Ministry of Finance, this
                            morning both quite convincingly supported the Ambassador’s request to
                            you yesterday afternoon.</p>

                        <p>Question: I understand Japanese particularly industrial circles are
                            concerned about what may happen Japanese economy event armistice. Do you
                            have any comment? Answer: That assumption about armistice is big one to
                            make at this point but I think I can say something about Japanese
                            economy. Stability Japanese economy is of course of great concern United
                            States and we giving great deal thought its future. We know in recent
                            years Japan’s balance-of-payments position has been largely supported by
                            United States expenditures arising from hostilities Korea, maintenance
                            United States forces Japan and various United States mutual assistance
                            programs Far East. Whatever may or may not happen regarding <pb xml:id="pg_1411" n="1411" facs="0355"/>Korean armistice negotiations
                            I believe total United States expenditures Japan will not be sharply
                            reduced but will remain at relatively high level for at least next two
                            years.</p>
                        <p>However if serious situation develops in Japanese economy I can assure
                            you we would want sit down together with Japanese to try consider ways
                            in which we could help.<note n="3" xml:id="d644fn3">

                                    from Tokyo, Apr. 14, <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated: “On balance I consider proposed
                                    question and answer for Secretary’s press conference desirable.”
                                    He added that it would not have a fundamental effect on the
                                    election but would provide material for Liberal and Progressive
                                    Party speakers. “Quite apart from immediate purpose of campaign
                                    I consider statement timely and beneficial.” (794.00/4–1453)</p>
                                <p>The statement was eventually made in somewhat different form by

                                    Korean armistice. However, the Department retained the substance
                                    of the undertakings in the last two sentences of the draft. For

                                        Imports, in real terms, are only about one-half and exports
                                        about one-third of the 1938 volume, Japan’s commercial trade
                                        deficit totaled approximately $750 million in 1952; its
                                        deficit with the dollar area was even larger. For at least
                                        the next two years earnings related to United States
                                        military activities in Japan and Korea will probably be
                                        sufficient to offset Japan’s trade deficit and to obviate
                                        the need for economic assistance.</item>

                                        results partly from its dependence for such vital raw
                                        materials as wheat, cotton, iron ore and coking coal upon
                                        dollar area sources. Its trade imbalance comes largely from
                                        being cut off from its pre-war markets in China and from the
                                        greatly reduced volume of Japan’s trade with Formosa and
                                        Korea. These factors point up the necessity for developing
                                        new and expanding old trade patterns with South and
                                        Southeast Asia.</item>

                                        critical importance to the security of the United States.
                                        This viability will be extremely difficult to achieve.
                                        Unrestricted trade with Communist China would not of itself
                                        solve Japan’s economic problem. Although Japan may achieve
                                        substantial gains in foreign trade, those gains will not,
                                        for the foreseeable future, be so great as to remove the
                                        necessity for substantial direct or indirect assistance,
                                        part of which could come from expenditures in Japan for U.S. forces.<list>

                                                years it may be possible to expand food production
                                                sufficiently to offset the population increase, in

                                                population growth will exceed the rate of increase
                                                in domestic food production, thus making Japan
                                                increasingly dependent on food imports. In addition

                                                Japanese exports went to the China mainland

                                                imports came from there. Even if Japanese strategic
                                                trade controls were relaxed, the extent to which
                                                this volume of trade could be restored is
                                                problematical, partly because prewar trade rested to

                                                control, and partly because the Communist Chinese

                                                living standards in Japan and the lack of a
                                                foreseeable solution will create fertile ground for
                                                Communist subversion, the United States may be faced
                                                with the necessity of providing direct or indirect
                                                economic aid to Japan. One important element of
                                                indirect economic aid which should be set in motion
                                                as soon as possible is a long-term program of

                                                for Japanese forces and for other free world forces.
                                                This program, which will probably require
                                                Congressional authorization, should be so planned as
                                                to build an adequate industrial base in Japan for
                                                the contemplated Japanese defense forces.</item>

                                        understanding with the Japanese Government with respect to
                                        rearmament. This problem is essentially but also involves
                                        important economic considerations, the chief of which is the
                                        level of budgetary support for rearmament which the economy
                                        can afford. The Cabinet has approved and sent to the Diet a
                                        request for an appropriation of 145 billion yen (the
                                        equivalent of $400 million) for defense for the fiscal year
                                        beginning April 1, 1953. This includes the yen equivalent of
                                        $180 million for maintenance of United States forces
                                        stationed in Japan, which is the same amount that the
                                        Japanese provided in the previous year. In addition, a
                                        carryover of approximately 65 billion yen ($180 million)
                                        will be available for defense in the coming year. Although
                                        these funds will be adequate for the maintenance of present
                                        Japanese forces, they are not considered sufficient to
                                        provide all the equipment, facilities, and training areas
                                        which will be required.”</item>

                                approved?</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>(1) The applications to the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss>
                            are ready for action by the Board and the National Advisory Council, but
                            are held up by one consideration, possible conflict with the
                            International Bank’s sphere of activity. The loans are to finance sales
                            of high pressure thermal equipment by Westinghouse and General Electric.
                            Westinghouse took the matter up with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> at an early phase, and he obtained an expression
                            from the International Bank that there would be no objection to such
                            financing by <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss>. Since then,
                            however, three things have happened. The amounts are larger than was
                            originally understood, the term of the loans is to be 15 years rather
                            than a shorter period, and the credits are to be extended to a Japanese
                            Government institution rather than to private companies. If the
                            applications were to be presented now, they would be considered more
                            appropriate for the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> than the
                                <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> took the position at the meeting
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss> April 24 that the
                            applications should be transferred to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> if the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> desires
                            and is prepared to proceed promptly, i.e., in three or four weeks not
                            three or four months. General Edgerton, new Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss>,<note n="1" xml:id="d647fn1">Maj. Gen. Glen E. Edgerton (ret.).</note> said he proposed to ask
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> or Mr. Garner what the
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> thought. Any protracted delay
                            would be a serious disappointment to the Japanese. The Japanese Embassy
                            has asked the good offices of the Department of State to avoid such a
                            situation. It does not appear possible for the applications to be
                            transferred to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and for quick
                            action to be taken.</p>
                        <p>This is of course a part of the larger problem of <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> relations which has been a sore point for some years.
                            It has been <pb xml:id="pg_1417" n="1417" facs="0361"/>United States
                            policy to regard the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> as the bank
                            of first recourse for development loans, but there has been little
                            attempt to reach a general understanding between the two institutions.
                            The Secretary of the Treasury is opposed to <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss> loans where other sources of financing are
                            available because <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss> loans
                            affect the public debt.</p>
                        <p>(2) An <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> mission went to Japan in the
                            fall of 1952 and was joined in December by Vice President Garner. After
                            considerable discussion with the Bank mission the Japanese submitted an
                            informal application for loans in the amount of $320 million, mostly for
                            power development. Mr. Garner’s public expressions were discouraging,
                            but he has indicated to the Department of State that the Bank would be
                            disposed to make loans to Japan in some magnitude if the United States
                            Government can give satisfactory answers to a number of questions, which
                            boil down to an expression of the longterm support by the United States
                            for the Japanese economy and of a United States foreign policy interest
                            in the making of such loans on the part of the Bank. Mr. Garner’s
                            questions (attached) were submitted to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> in February and March of this year but have not
                            been answered. Recently the Japanese Government submitted a revised
                            informal application in the amount of $120 million, still for power
                            development.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear feasible to give Mr. Garner an authoritative written
                            reply to his questions because security considerations are involved and
                            because such an answer would imply commitments which the United States
                            Government is not in position to make. If a formal position were to be
                            taken it would be appropriate to submit it to the National Advisory
                            Council, but it is believed that any such attempt would result in such a
                            whittling down of the position as to make it meaningless. The Bank’s
                            staff has already had access to all the relevant information in the
                            possession of the United States agencies.</p>
                        <p>We have discussed these problems extensively with the Office of Financial
                            and Development Policy in the Department of State and with staff
                            officers in Treasury, and the following recommendations take views
                            expressed by them into account. It does not appear profitable, however,
                            to pursue the matter further at staff levels. The normal relationship of
                            the Department to the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss> is
                            through the Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs who represents the
                            Secretary at meetings of the <gloss target="#t_ExImBank1">Eximbank</gloss> Board. The normal contacts with the International

                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> What are the prospects of United
                            States continuing special flow of dollars sufficient to cover service on
                            loans in addition to current Japanese requirements even as and when
                            Japan takes over her own defense and the present dollar income from the
                            presence of United States troops in Japan gradually disappears?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> It is recognized at high levels of the
                            United States Government that the United States will have to continue
                            economic assistance to Japan in some form at least as long as security
                            considerations prevent any high volume of trade with the mainland of
                            Asia. As long as the United States maintains large forces in the area,
                            Japan’s earnings from this source will probably enable it to meet its
                            foreign exchange needs and commitments. It is impossible now to
                            determine the precise arrangements which will obtain when these special
                            dollar earnings diminish to a point endangering Japan’s dollar position.
                            That is probably four to five years away. Present thinking in the United
                            States Government is that necessary assistance will continue to be
                            rendered to the extent that the military requirements permit though <hi rend="italic">[through]</hi> offshore procurement of military
                            end-items. A beginning of such offshore procurement has already been
                            made, more is contemplated under the <pb xml:id="pg_1419" n="1419" facs="0363"/>United States Fiscal Year 1954 aid programs, and it is
                            United States policy to try to program such procurement for several
                            years ahead.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> What burdens are the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> debt settlement and possible

                            payments?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The United States will probably ask Japan
                            to repay the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> claim at the rate
                            of about $32 million a year for 35 years. A decision by the National
                            Advisory Council is anticipated soon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> is firmly opposed to seeking repayment in larger
                            amounts.</p>
                        <p>It is not anticipated that reparations settlements will impose any
                            significant burden on the Japanese balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> Does United States consider it
                            desirable for the Bank to lend to Japan? If so, what are the reasons in
                            favor of such lending and what amount would be necessary to have a
                            significant effect on the Japanese economic situation, including
                            Japanese financial and economic policies?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The United States Government would like to
                            see loans to Japan by the International Bank. It recognizes that Japan’s
                            investment requirements must be met for the most part from internal
                            sources, and that at present Japan does not lack dollars with which to
                            finance imports which are economically justified. The Japanese are
                            understandably hesitant about committing their foreign currency reserves
                            for long-range development purposes, however. Japan’s history indicates
                            that it would make every effort to meet its obligations, and the
                            servicing of even as much as $500 million of loans would not be a
                            crucial factor in its international payments. Japan’s total investment
                            requirements (yen and foreign currency) over the next five years are
                            estimated to be of the order of $20 billion. Loans could be linked to
                            the import requirements (direct and indirect) of power development and
                            other necessary investment projects.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for loans are primarily, however, of a psychological and
                            political nature. Both the Japanese economy and political atmosphere are
                            highly sensitive, and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans would
                            have implications in Japan with respect to the friendship and
                            cooperation of its former enemies out of all proportion to the economic
                            importance. Conversely, refusal to loan would be taken as a rejection of
                            Japan and an indication of lack of confidence in Japan’s future. It
                            would strengthen those elements in Japan which believe that Japan must
                            seek a middle course or even cooperation with the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>From the standpoint just discussed, loans of modest amounts would help,
                            particularly if no ceiling was announced. <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans could also be helpful in influencing internal
                            Japanese financial <pb xml:id="pg_1420" n="1420" facs="0364"/>policies,
                            in particular the directing of Japanese resources into the most
                            essential investment. From this standpoint, the larger the loans the
                            better. To have maximum effect, there should be an initial statement of
                            willingness, on proper terms, to lend up to $300 million. If such a
                            statement is unreasonable, and we are inclined to think it may be, it is
                            believed that loans of the order of the current Japanese request—i.e.,
                            $120 million—would be useful. Either a large general commitment or a
                            series of project loans over a period would provide a basis for a voice
                            in Japanese policies. They would not furnish leverage to insist upon
                            policies opposed by the Japanese Government or important elements in the
                            community, but they could help the Government to put across measures
                            which it desired. It is believed that specific conditions, as opposed to
                            advice, should relate directly to the development and execution of an
                            investment program. Advice and conditions would be received with better
                            grace from the Bank than from the United States Government. The very
                            preparation of loanable projects, together with Bank advice, could
                            stimulate necessary planning on the part of the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> Is there sufficient agreement
                            between Bank and United States on the financial and economic policies
                            and measures essential for Japan’s progress to provide for consistent
                            advice, inducements and conditions in relation to financial assistance
                            from both parties?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The United States Government is in
                            complete agreement with the views expressed by Mr. Garner on a number of

                            necessary on Japan’s part, anticipates no conflict in the future, and is
                            prepared to consult frequently with the Bank, if it should determine to
                            proceed with major loans, on the advice and conditions which may be
                            given by the United States and the Bank respectively.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> If Bank is to do lending, will
                            United States consider it appropriate that any funds supplied by it

                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The United States regards the
                            International Bank as the bank of first recourse for long-term
                            development loans. It believes it would be desirable for the Export
                            Import Bank to proceed with the thermal power plant loans presently
                            under consideration, but would consider that in the future the
                            International Bank would be the logical lender for loans of comparable
                            amounts and terms. The United States would not expect to use loans to
                            effect balance of payments assistance which may become necessary, but
                            would prefer to rely on offshore procurement or even direct grant
                            aid.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1421" n="1421" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>This would depend, however, on circumstances and Congressional policies
                            not now clearly foreseeable.</p>

                            the possibilities of financing from various sources the development of
                            supplies of foodstuffs and raw materials so as to free Japan from
                            excessive dependence on the dollar area?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> Japan’s progress toward self support
                            depends in large measure on the economic development of other countries,
                            particularly in South and Southeast Asia. The Department of State
                            believes that the International Bank can play an important role in such
                            development, through both its funds and its advice, and that there
                            should be close cooperation to this end between the Bank and United
                            States agencies. The Administration has as yet had little opportunity to
                            examine the possibilities, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> is expected to attack the problem aggressively
                            in relation to United States aid programs, and the Department of State

                            to make long-term development loans to Japan. He stated that there was
                            essentially nothing new in his opinion since he had expressed it
                            recently to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> and
                            to Minister Watanabe last fall. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> could not understand the Japanese attitude toward
                            both these banks and was anxious that they not take it for granted that
                            they could talk independently to both lending institutions and thus play
                            one against the other. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> had come in to see him recently to state that the
                            Government of Japan considered the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>
                            application first priority and that the application to the Export-Import
                            Bank was an initiative of private American companies.<note n="1" xml:id="d648fn1">Corbett prepared another memorandum of this
                                conversation. A portion reads as follows: “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> also quoted Japanese Embassy
                                officials as saying that these [Export-Import Bank loans] had
                                relatively low priority as compared to the $102 million of loan
                                requests submitted by the Japanese Government; the officials
                                referred to the loans as the ‘Westinghouse loans’ even though an
                                agency of the Japanese Government is to be the obligor. There was a
                                strong suggestion that the loans were a commercial promotion.”
                                (Memorandum drafted May 19, 894.10/5–1453)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> stated the Japanese could not
                            have it both ways. He said that he had carefully expressed to Watanabe
                            last fall before the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> mission went
                            to Japan that Japan should select one bank or the other and that if it
                            selected the Export-Import Bank as its lending institution, the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> would not be able to consider loans
                            to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> both emphasized complete
                            agreement within the Department of State with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>’s general position that there
                            could only be one Bank. They both stated that the State Department
                            completely agreed that in general and under normal circumstances the
                            lending institution should be the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.
                            Nevertheless, they pointed out that there are special circumstances
                            which justified an exception to the general principle. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> pointed out that a good deal of
                            work had been done on the application for thermal power projects before
                            the Export-Import Bank and that it would be useful to get ahead for
                            complete consideration. He fully sympathized with the World Bank’s
                            position and had made this clear in the meetings of the Export-Import
                            Bank Board. He felt that the time element alone in speedy processing of
                            the applications warranted reconsideration by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> of his general position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> emphasized that it was important
                            for political as well as economic reasons to move ahead quickly on power
                            projects. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that
                            the Japanese are terribly anxious for affirmative action and were
                            frequently calling at the State Department on this matter. He pointed
                            out the sensitive nature of the political situation in Japan and the
                            desirability of the <pb xml:id="pg_1423" n="1423" facs="0367"/>United
                            States as a matter of policy not to intensify that difficulty. He
                            pointed out that a number of critical issues are affecting
                            American-Japanese relations and that one more is to be avoided if it is
                            possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> told Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> that the Japanese are
                            under the impression that the World Bank had understood and not objected
                            to the American companies going ahead in the Export-Import Bank on their
                            power projects. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName>
                            repeated that the Japanese were incorrect and that the Bank had always
                            been concerned over the possibility that the Japanese might try to
                            develop two lending agencies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> then pointed out that
                            under certain circumstances it might be possible for the World Bank to
                            consider loans to Japan favorably. He could not assure the reaction of
                            his Board on this matter but he said he would be willing to undertake
                            it. In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName>’s
                            question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said that he
                            would do this immediately and that he was sure he could have an answer
                            well within a month’s time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, and Mr. Overby agreed that
                            the more desirable next step would be for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> to consider this question and
                            give his answer as soon as possible. Mr. Overby agreed to call General
                            Edgerton today to inform him of this decision and suggest that he call
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> to direct respective
                            next steps which each bank should take in this regard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER1">Black</persName> said that he did not know whether
                            the Bank had sufficient data on the Japanese application or what stage
                            the Japanese application to the Export-Import Bank had reached. He
                            indicated that he might have to lean heavily on the Export-Import Bank’s
                            preparation.</p>
                        <p>Following Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s
                            departure for another meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHF1">Linder</persName> orally summarized the attached list of answers to
                            the Bank’s six questions.<note n="2" xml:id="d648fn2">Not found

                            policy would be more helpful although it might not be decisive.</p>

                            important today to US security interests in the Far East as it was last
                            Aug. I again strongly urge that such recommendations be adopted as the
                            US Govt psn in this matter and that this psn be publicly announced in
                            official statement re political status of the Islands which I understand
                            is now in preparation. In my judgment it would be highly imprudent at
                            this time for the US to concur in resumption of sovereignty, or the
                            exercise thereof, by Japan in any part of this area. Such course of
                            action would to large degree make the effective maintenance and opn of
                            important US military bases and facilities in Ryukyu Islands dependent
                            upon friendly and cooperative Japan, which cannot now be assuredly
                            forecast for the indefinite pd of time when US security interests will
                            remain of overriding importance. Any pos political and psychological
                            advantages which might be developed in US-Japan relations from reversion
                            of sovereignty to the latter would not with any certainty outlast the
                            life of the govt in power at time the concessions were made. This
                            consideration, therefore, appears to be tenuous ground upon which to
                            base compromise of clear US security interests.</p>
                        <p>Part III. It is inconceivable that return of Okinawa, the very heart of
                            our military bases in the islands, will be seriously considered.
                            Regarding reversion to Japan of Amami Island group only, the fol
                            comments are offered:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. The Amami Island group consists of 5 major isls, namely, Amami
                                Oshima including closely adjacent Kaerom-Jima, TokunoShima,
                                Okino-Erabu Shima, Kikaiga-Shima and Yoron-Jima. The main isl of
                                Amami totals 323 square miles and contains half the population of
                                the group which totals aproximately 220,000 persons. The remainder
                                of the isls encompass some 167 square miles.</item>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_1425" n="1425" facs="0369"/>
                            <item>b. The Amami Isls have longer historical ties with Japan and their
                                people are racially and culturally closer to Japan than those of the
                                remaining isls. Contacts with Japan date back to 12 century AD when
                                large scale immigration took place from Japan pursuant to defeat of
                                Taira faction which settled on isls. Amami group actually conquered
                                by Japan 1609, became part of Kogeshima prefecture, while remaining
                                Ryukyus administered from Okinawa prefecture. Amamians feel superior
                                to their countrymen in the Southern Isls.</item>
                            <item>c. Sentiment for reversion to Japan, therefore, is considerably
                                stronger in the Amami area than elsewhere in Ryukyu Isls. Since
                                ratification of peace treaty with Japan reversion movement
                                intensified because of awakened hopes for return to Japan stimulated
                                by theory of “residual sovereignty in Japan.”</item>
                            <item>d. Economically the Amami Isls are and have always been in need of
                                assistance. The natural resources are extremely meager. Fisheries
                                products prosper only intermittently. Poverty-ridden peasants
                                sustain themselves miserably with tiny patches of rice lands in
                                valleys of the mountainous and rugged country while sweet potatoes
                                are cultivated on terraces.</item>
                            <item>e. The Jap Govt is probably aware of fact that Amami group may
                                become an economic liability but it may be assumed that Japan’s
                                eagerness to increased political prestige through even minor
                                territorial expansion will override economic considerations.</item>
                            <item>f. The present military installations on these isls consist of 2
                                fixed radio stations utilized in theater opns for Okinawa traffic.
                                The potential for more intensive use of Amami group for
                                communications, electronics installations, and Loran facilities is
                                considered to be significant factor to this command in event of

                            <item>g. The strategic importance of these isls lies in their immediate
                                proximity to our established facilities in Okinawa. As Okinawa is an
                                airbase, early warning svc is needed for some 200 miles in each
                                direction. Such svc could be jammed by stations established within
                                its periphery. In an emergency the Amami group of isls would be
                                utilized for expansion of US controlled facilities without
                                requirement of establishing agreements with another
                                nation—Japan.</item>
                            <item>h. In event Japan were to evidence an unfriendly attitude toward
                                US in a sit where subject isls were under Japanese sovereignty it
                                would present an addtl threat to our forces and installations on
                                Okinawa, all the more critical in sit where we might have to
                                consider transfer of security forces from Japan to Ryukyus.</item>
                            <item>i. Return to Japan would permit Jap Govt which might be unfriendly
                                to stir up dissatisfaction in remainder of isls through subsidies to
                                Amami group for abnormal improvement in social, educational and
                                economic well being of local population, and thus artificially
                                stimulate reversion movement in isls still under US
                                administration.</item>
                            <item>j. Partial reversion would constitute crack in US psn in Ryukyu
                                Isls which the political opposition in Japan would seek to widen.
                                Such action would force justification on artificial grounds between
                                strategic value of Amami group and Southern Isls. Instead of
                                allaying friction in US-Japan relations re status of Ryukyu Isls,
                                partial <pb xml:id="pg_1426" n="1426" facs="0370"/>reversion would
                                more likely lead to further pressure and additional tension.</item>
                            <item>k. Locally, change of status in Amami group would be politically
                                dangerous. The present composition of Ryukyuan legislature is 17
                                pro-American Democratic Party members, 11 Socialist Masses Party
                                members, and 2 Ryukyu Peoples Party members. The latter 2 parties,
                                recently acting in coalition, are leftist in character and Ryukyu
                                Peoples Party Communist-Affiliated. One seat is at present vacant.
                                Six of 17 Democratic Party Members are from Amami group while 2
                                leftist parties are represented in Amami by 1 member each. The
                                political realignment and decrease in pro-American strength in
                                assembly which would result from return of Amami group to Japan is
                                obvious. In campaigns for new elections leftist parties would also
                                try to exploit even partial reversion to Japan as their victory
                                brought about by their anti-American propaganda and thus increase
                                reversion pressure for remainder of isls.</item>
                            <item>1. Since present status of Ryukyu Isls is based on art 3 of peace
                                treaty with Japan, US could not unilaterally change that status with
                                respect to any part of isls group. Reversion of Amami Isls to Japan
                                might well be opposed by certain signatories to peace treaty which
                                have at various times in past stated apprehension re Japanese
                                expansion to the south.</item>

                        <p>It is urgently recommended that there be no change in political status of

                                    by the Secretary, although steps are in process to present it to

                                    that he had no opposition to the return of the Amami group,
                                    although he did not want to be quoted since he does not have

                        <p>Mr. Garner informed me today that the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> made the following decisions regarding Japan’s
                            electric power loans:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(1) The Bank will take over the loan for thermal power of
                                approximately $40 million. The Bank can complete arrangements on
                                this in about six weeks.</item>
                            <item>(2) However, if that is not soon enough Mr. Garner says temporary
                                credit can be arranged through Mr. Maffrey, of the Irving
                                Trust.</item>
                            <item>(3) The Bank continues to believe that there should be only one
                                bank for Japan, and that it should be the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>. If it extends a loan to Japan, the Bank will
                                expect to work out arrangements with the Japanese Government to help
                                it develop conservative fiscal policies.</item>
                            <item>(4) Under present conditions, the loaning capacity of the Bank to
                                Japan will be restricted to a ceiling of $100 million.</item>
                            <item>(5) Whether or not 40 percent of this $100 million should be
                                devoted to thermal power projects is up to the Japanese Government
                                to decide.</item>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_1428" n="1428" facs="0372"/>
                            <item>(6) The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> will waive its usual
                                requirements for competitive bids in view of the fact that
                                Westinghouse Corporation and General Electric are the logical
                                suppliers of the highly technical equipment involved.</item>
                            <item>(7) While the Bank is ready to consider these arrangements with
                                Japan, it is up to the Japanese to decide on the priority of the
                                projects and the loans themselves.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. Garner asked me to inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> of the above position of the Bank and the decision
                            is now up to the Japanese Government. Mr. Garner also asked me to inform
                            him when the Japanese Government indicated to the Department of State
                            its reaction to the above proposals. At that time, Mr. Garner would like
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> to see him about
                            the terms, arrangements, etc., of the loan.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized to Mr. Garner our firm and continued interest in Japan and
                            the Far East could be counted on and that the loans he was prepared to
                            make to Japan on a sound financial basis would provide a real
                            contribution to the interests of the United States Government in that

                        <p rend="center">Alternatives and Problems</p>
                        <p>11. Decision by the U.S. Government on its long-term policy with respect
                            to the Japanese Treaty Islands is urgently needed. Effective action on
                            virtually all major problems now facing the United States in its
                            administration of the islands, particularly the Ryukyus, is hampered—in
                            some cases seriously—by the lack of a settled policy. Moreover, delay by
                            the United States in defining and making public its intentions tends to
                            permit the development in Japan and in the islands of political
                            pressures and issues which are made to order for political exploitation
                            inimical to U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Alternatives</p>
                        <p>12. Four possible courses of action are open to the United States with
                            respect to the islands. These alternatives are briefly discussed in the
                            following paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Application to the United Nations for a Strategic
                                Trusteeship</hi>. This is the course of action which was envisaged
                            at the time of the Peace Treaty, and various public statements at that
                            time indicated that the United States intended to retain only
                            temporarily its exercise of all powers of administration, legislation
                            and jurisdiction. However, it has become increasingly apparent that
                            there are serious disadvantages to this course of action. The
                            application for a strategic trusteeship would be subject to a possible
                            Soviet Union veto in the Security Council, and we might, therefore, have
                            to accept an ordinary trusteeship. Our subsequent administration would
                            be subject to harassment in the United Nations by the Soviet Union and
                            its satellites. In addition, the Japanese would <pb xml:id="pg_1430" n="1430" facs="0374"/>regard trusteeship as a step away from the
                            eventual relinquishing of powers of civil administration to them, and
                            would therefore resent it. For these reasons, State and Defense agree
                            that it is not desirable to request a United Nations trusteeship over
                            these islands.</p>
                        <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Relinquishing Authority Over All the Islands to
                                Japan</hi>. Under the present conditions of international tension in
                            the Far East, it is important for the maintenance of our defense system
                            in the Pacific that we retain an assured control over at least the major
                            base areas in these islands. State and Defense therefore agree that for
                            the present we should not relinquish to Japan powers of civil
                            administration over the Ryukyu Islands south of the Amami group, Nanpo
                            Shoto (including the Bonins, Rosario and the Volcanos), and Parece Vela
                            and Marcus Islands.</p>
                        <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Maintenance of Existing Degree of United States
                                Control Over All the Islands</hi>. It is the view of the Secretary
                            of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commander in Chief, Far East,
                            and the Commander in Chief, Pacific, that the Ryukyus and Bonin-Volcano
                            Islands are of such vital importance to the security of the United
                            States that there should be no relaxation in the degree of present
                            United States control until the Pacific area is no longer threatened by
                            Communist aggression. The reasons for this position follow:<note n="*" xml:id="d651fn3">For detailed statement, see Annex A. [Footnote in
                                the source text. Annex A is not printed.]</note>

                        <list>
                            <item>a. The security and effective control of military bases on these
                                islands would be jeopardized by relinquishing of any degree of full
                                administrative control granted to the United States over the islands
                                by article 3 of the Japanese Peace Treaty.</item>
                            <item>b. The strategic importance of these islands was recognized by the
                                Secretaries of State and Defense in a memorandum dated September 8,
                                1950 forwarded jointly to the President (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 60/1),<note n="3" xml:id="d651fn4">For text, see

                                certain security requirements should be considered vital and that
                                the negotiations concerning the Japanese Peace Treaty must take them
                                into account. These requirements included “its terms must secure to
                                the United States exclusive strategic control of the Ryukyu Islands
                                south of latitude 29 degrees north, Marcus Island, and the Nanpo
                                Shoto south of Sofu Gan”. Since the date of the aforementioned
                                memorandum, security conditions have considerably worsened in the
                                Pacific area and United States security requirements in these
                                islands has <hi rend="italic">[have]</hi> increased rather than

                            <item>c. Return of the Amami group to Japan would unquestionably
                                intensify Japanese efforts to gain control of the rest of the
                                Ryukyus. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, in a letter of a few weeks ago to the
                                United States Ambassador in Japan, stated that Japan’s desire for
                                    <pb xml:id="pg_1431" n="1431" facs="0375"/>return of Amami is “a
                                first step” toward return of full control of all of the Ryukyus to
                                Japan.</item>
                            <item>d. No predictable political benefit to the United States resulting
                                from the granting of any concession to Japan could outweigh the
                                certain jeopardy to the integrity of the U.S. strategic position in
                                the Far East which would result from any modification of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> of the subject islands. By <hi rend="italic">“status quo”</hi> is meant continuing full
                                authority of the United States to exercise any and all powers over
                                these areas as granted by Article 3 of the Peace Treaty.</item>
                            <item>e. Japanese desire for return of the Ryukyus does not spring from
                                concern on their part of alleged shortcomings of the U.S.
                                administration of the islands.</item>
                            <item>f. Return of all the islands to Japan during present international
                                tensions in the Far East is considered undesirable by State as well
                                as by Defense. Return of Amami alone, unless accompanied by an
                                indication of additional U.S. concessions, would be at most a minor
                                gain for the Japanese, and even undesirable for them in some
                                respects. It would therefore appear erroneous to suppose that
                                returning the Amami group would have any significantly favorable
                                results for the United States in solving serious problems in
                                US-Japanese relations.</item>
                            <item>g. A public statement of the United States intention to retain
                                these full powers until conditions of peace and stability prevail in
                                the Far East is essential in order (1) to eliminate reversion
                                pressure as a political problem in the Ryukyu Islands, (2) to permit
                                effective action on major problems now facing the United States in
                                its administration of the area, and (3) to forestall the development
                                in Japan of political issues made to order for political
                                exploitation.</item>

                            believes that authority over the Amami group should be relinquished to
                            Japan at an early date, after agreement with Japan on the necessary

                            matters pending with Japan. There should be no revision of the status of
                            the other islands during the present conditions of international tension
                            in the Far East, but ultimately civil administration in all the islands
                            should be relinquished to Japan after agreement has been reached with
                            the Japanese assuring us of the necessary military rights. This

                                control <pb xml:id="pg_1432" n="1432" facs="0376"/>over all islands
                                except the Amami group protects our essential strategic interests.
                                The relinquishing of our powers of civil administration in the Amami
                                group will be of minimal strategic significance, but will allay the
                                most acute of the political difficulties with Japan. If steps are
                                taken at the same time to improve civil administration in the
                                Ryukyus and to give added responsibility to the Japanese, other
                                sources of continuing friction between the United States and Japan
                                will be removed.</item>
                            <item>b. Restoration of their administrative control over the Amami
                                group will relieve the Japanese Government of a major source of
                                opposition pressure. At the same time our continued political
                                control over our major bases in the area will keep the Japanese
                                Government technically free from responsibility for operations which
                                may have to be conducted from these bases.</item>
                            <item>c. While there is no doubt that the Japanese will continue to
                                express their desire to regain administrative control over all of
                                the islands, effective implementation of the recommendations for
                                improving administration over them, together with public
                                announcement of our intentions, will greatly decrease present
                                agitation and friction.</item>
                            <item>d. By taking steps to meet the increasing Japanese desire to
                                regain powers of civil administration over at least some of these
                                islands, the United States gains bargaining leverage which should
                                help us in other matters on which we must deal with the
                                Japanese.</item>
                            <item>e. United States financial and administrative responsibility in
                                the Ryukyus will decrease as Japanese responsibility is gradually
                                increased; nevertheless the United States will retain the necessary
                                measure of control over these islands.</item>
                            <item>f. The recommended course of action will eliminate most of the
                                basis for one of the major propaganda weapons the Communists and
                                other anti-American elements have used in trying to drive a wedge
                                between Japan and the United States. It will also diminish the
                                effectiveness of the appeal of similar groups to the Ryukyuan
                                population. Thus the United States has in this situation an
                                opportunity for a positive step which will seize the psychological
                                initiative from the Soviets in the efforts to capture Japanese
                                public opinion.</item>
                            <item>g. This course of action will materially strengthen the
                                willingness of the Japanese Government and people to cooperate with
                                the United States, and will thus strengthen the security of the
                                offshore island chain in the Pacific.</item>

                        <p>17. Whatever decision is taken as to the status of the islands—whether

                            State—numerous urgent problems will face the U.S. administration in the
                            Ryukyus. Among the more pressing and difficult are those associated with
                            improving relationships between the local government and the civil
                            administration, assuring adequate sources of revenue for the native
                            government, creating a workable and acceptable system <pb xml:id="pg_1433" n="1433" facs="0377"/>for compensating and
                            resettling the Ryukyuans whose land is required by the United States,
                            and rebuilding a school system fast enough to meet the needs of the
                            population. A revised directive for the U.S. administration,
                            implementing solutions and approaches to these problems, is now in draft
                            form. Issuance of the new directive has, of necessity, been held up
                            pending final decision on the longrange disposition of the Ryukyus.
                            There is also an immediate need to define the basic authority for civil
                            administration over any islands to be retained. Accordingly, it would be
                            desirable for the Department of Defense to expedite issuance of the
                            revised civil affairs directive for the Ryukyus and to prepare any other
                            necessary instrument defining the basic authority for administration of
                            these islands.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/5 is to be considered by the
                            National Security Council at its meeting on Thursday, June 18. On April
                            8, the National Security Council considered <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/4, an earlier and substantially similar draft of
                            this paper. However, it believed that the paper did not sufficiently
                            emphasize the problem of the long-term viability of the Japanese
                            economy, and it therefore referred the paper to the Planning Board for
                            the addition of such material.</p>
                        <p>The Planning Board added to the Progress Report on Pages 15 to 17 a
                            section analyzing Japan’s economic problem. In addition, Paragraph 2 on
                            Page 1 of the paper calls particular attention to the fact that for the
                            foreseeable future Japan will require “substantial direct or indirect
                            assistance” from the United States. This is the central fact about
                            Japan’s economic situation which necessarily colors all United States
                            policies and courses of action with respect to Japan.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/5 reaffirms the previous policy
                            paper on Japan, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/2, which was
                            approved by the President on August 7, 1952.<note n="2" xml:id="d652fn2">
                                <ref target="#d588">Document 588</ref>.</note> Then in Section
                            3, the present paper lists certain courses of action which require
                            special emphasis now and in the near future. Since <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/2 was completed in the post-treaty
                            period, we believe after carefully reviewing it that, with the addition
                            of the new paper to stress those matters which are currently most
                            urgent, it is still valid as a statement of our basic policy toward
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Section 3b(l) on Page 3 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/5
                            concludes by saying “Nevertheless, the United States should continue
                            efforts to persuade the Japanese Government to accelerate the
                            development of its defense forces”, which was inserted by the Planning
                            Board at Defense insistence. We believe that it conflicts to some extent
                            with the concept of reaching a mutually agreed program with the Japanese
                            which is set forth in the first sentence of the same section. It would
                            be desirable in the discussion of this paper to emphasize the political,
                            psychological and economic difficulties which defense measures pose for
                            the Japanese, and to call attention to the fact that we may <pb xml:id="pg_1435" n="1435" facs="0379"/>find that too great
                            pressure—especially public pressure—upon them to speed their defense
                            buildup will be self-defeating.</p>

                        <p>The Defense position is that there should be no revision in the status of
                            any of these Treaty islands for the indefinite future. As the result of
                            our conversation on June 11, you approved a Department of State position
                            which agrees that we should retain all of the islands except the Amami
                            group in their present status while present international tensions in
                            the Far East continue.<note n="4" xml:id="d653fn4">No memorandum of this
                                conversation has been found in Department of State files. On June 2
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> had sent to the
                                Secretary a memorandum containing a proposed Department of State
                                position for submission to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                Planning Board, and had commented on the proposal in part as
                                follows: “In all but one respect this [position] is consistent with
                                the position you approved as the result of a memorandum of March 18
                                to you from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>. This
                                one respect is the implicit recommendation that the Bonin Islands
                                should be retained and that the islanders should not be permitted to
                                return during present international tensions in the Far East. At the
                                conference in Honolulu with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Frank
                                    Nash</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> agreed that he would be willing to present
                                this position to the Japanese Government and to recommend it to you.
                                    <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> concurs.” (794C.0221/5–2953)
                                For the memorandum dated Mar. 18, see <ref target="#d638">Document
                                    638</ref>.</note> However, <pb xml:id="pg_1436" n="1436" facs="0380"/>we recommend that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> determine that we should relinquish control over the
                            Amami group to Japan at an early date, the precise timing to be
                            determined in relation to other matters which we have pending with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>In the annexes, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> is presented with
                            a basic difference in political judgment. Nothing in the Defense paper
                            indicates that the Amami group has any strategic importance which could
                            not be adequately protected by securing appropriate base rights from the
                            Japanese. The Defense case is therefore predicated upon the theory that
                            relinquishing control over the Amami group would whet the enthusiasm of
                            the Japanese to regain control over the rest of the islands and would
                            increase irredentist sentiment among the islanders. Our own judgment is
                            that we can ease a serious and increasing source of friction by
                            relinquishing control over the Amami group. The Japanese Government
                            desires reversion of the islands and has formally told us so. They know
                            that the strategic case for our retention of Amami is weak, whereas the
                            strategic case for the retention of the other islands is strong. In
                            order to enable us, without alienating the Japanese, to retain control
                            over the islands where we need it for our strategic interest, we should
                            relinquish the control we do not need.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                        <p>That you support the Department of State position as set forth in

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council on
                            the background of the present paper, and then discussed the problem of
                            criminal jurisdiction over our forces in Japan, which was complicated by
                            the fact that the Congress had not yet acted on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> status of forces proposal which, if
                            accepted, would apply also in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President predicted that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            status of forces proposal would have a tough time in the Congress. It
                            was impossible to surmise why the inhabitants of Capitol Hill thought
                            they knew more about how to handle such problems than the military men
                            on the scene.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of the relation between the objective of achieving higher goals
                            for the Japanese armed forces and at the same time strengthening the
                            Japanese economy, the President observed that we must be careful not to
                            urge too high standards of military readiness on <pb xml:id="pg_1439" n="1439" facs="0383"/>the various nations we were trying to rearm.
                            If we believed that the Japanese should go from 4 to 10 divisions, the
                            President stated that we would have to help them.</p>
                        <p>There then ensued a discussion of the Financial Appendix on page 7 of the
                                report.<note n="5" xml:id="d655fn5">See the enclosure, <ref target="#d654">

                        </p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of this discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he doubted if the
                            present report accurately reflected the desperate state of the Japanese
                            and, more particularly, the impact on their economy of an end of
                            hostilities in Korea and a consequent lessening of our procurement in
                            Japan for war purposes. He pointed out that recently the Japanese had
                            dipped heavily into their dollar reserves, and he did not see how it
                            would long be possible for the Japanese to go on with their terrible
                            trade deficit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                            report urged an increase of Japanese trade with Southeast Asia as
                            offering possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that there was at
                            least one favorable development in this grim picture—the Japanese had at
                            last succeeded in getting back into the sterling area, from which they
                            had been so long excluded.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired why Japan expressed its deficit in terms of
                            dollars. Can’t they trade with non-dollar countries? We ought, thought
                            the President, to encourage trade, for example, between the Philippines
                            and Japan. The President pointed out, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> confirmed, that the big
                            Japanese dollar deficit arose from the purchase in the United States of
                            coal, iron ore, and rice. Perhaps it would be possible to purchase
                            Australian coal instead, and in any case, new avenues of non-dollar
                            trade must certainly be opened to the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>While there was general agreement with these views, the Secretary of
                            State pointed out that continued hostility toward Japan in the Southeast
                            Asian areas she had overrun during the last war, still constituted an
                            obstacle to this kind of trade.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired whether our Bureau of Mines had any
                            statistics on coal resources in the Philippines. He thought that the
                            Council should be provided with information on this point.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council on
                            the background of the report and the long-term disagreement between the
                            Departments of State and Defense with respect to the treaty islands. He
                            then called attention to the recommendations on page 10 of the
                                report,<note n="8" xml:id="d655fn8">Numbered paragraph 18.</note>
                            including the difference between State and Defense with respect to the
                            return of the Amami group to Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on the Secretary of State for his
                            views.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in the
                            light of current developments in Korea he strongly questioned whether
                            this was the moment to decide on the return of any of these islands to
                            Japan. It would be quite satisfactory to him if the Council deferred
                            decision until we know whether there is to be more war or more peace in
                            Korea. If we had to withdraw from Korea it might be very undesirable to
                            effect any change in the status of these islands.</p>
                        <p>While specific events in recent days caused him to feel as he did,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to say
                            that in general in past months and years he had felt that the United
                            States should allow the maximum possible civilian control over these
                            islands, compatible with military requirements, to revert to the
                            Japanese. He pointed out that the Defense Department argued that nothing
                            less than 100% U.S. control was in fact compatible with military and
                            security requirements. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> emphasized that he could not understand this
                            Defense Department position. On the contrary, it seemed to him perfectly
                            possible to maintain the necessary U.S. bases in these treaty islands
                            without assumption by the U.S. of civil administration in them. Such
                            administration was costly to the United States and unpopular in Japan.
                            He pointed out that he had drawn up the peace treaty between the United
                            States and Japan in such <pb xml:id="pg_1441" n="1441" facs="0385"/>fashion as to permit the United States to retain all that was needed
                            by way of authority to protect vital security interests, but that he had
                            not believed that we needed to annex all these islands to achieve our
                            military objectives.</p>
                        <p>Okinawa, he pointed out, was an exception to his general thinking. It was
                            such a large military base and such an important one, that it would
                            probably have to remain wholly under United States administration. Even
                            so, he hoped that this administration in Okinawa could be made more
                            civilian-minded. The administration of Okinawa still carried a heavy
                            wartime flavor and character, with the result that 90% of the Okinawans
                            hated the United States. The Secretary said that, under recommendation
                                <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss> on page 10 of the paper, it would be
                            possible to improve this situation and to get rid of obsolete wartime
                            directives for the civilian administration.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to
                            express his firm conviction that the extraordinary legal rights which
                            had been secured to the United States in the peace treaty with Japan,
                            would eventually prove quite worthless unless we exercised these rights
                            in a manner designed to secure the support and loyalty of the Japanese.
                            This was true both in Japan and in the islands.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            stressed his complete inability to grasp why, in order to maintain a
                            radar and radio station for the U.S. in the Amami Islands, it was
                            necessary to take over the entire administration of these islands. This
                            made no sense to him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that it cost
                            the United States approximately $2,000,000 a year to administer this
                            group of islands, and that the Japanese could do it readily enough with
                            yen.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired as to the population of the Amami group. For the
                            moment, nobody could answer his question, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then expressed the viewpoint of
                            the Department of Defense as against the views just expressed by the
                            Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>The point, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>,
                            was that our military felt that their position in the islands was a good
                            deal more secure than our position in Japan proper. Our military people
                            thought that Okinawa and our other bases were extremely important to us,
                            quite independently of our base rights in Japan. If, however, we could
                            be sure that the Japanese would “stay with us” over the long term, he
                            would be glad to give up the administration of the islands. He
                            furthermore expressed agreement with the Secretary of State’s position
                            that it was not necessary to rule over all the people of the Amami
                            Islands in order to maintain a United States radio and radar
                            station.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that we must get down to the business of our
                            objectives in these areas. We could start, he said, with our conviction
                            that the retention of Japan and of its potential strength <pb xml:id="pg_1442" n="1442" facs="0386"/>was of vital importance to
                            our own security interests. Accordingly, to insist on controlling this
                            little group of islands, which obviously meant a lot to Japan, amounted
                            to risking the loss of our main objective, which was to assure ourselves
                            of Japan’s friendship and loyalty over the long run. This seemed to him,
                            said the President, silly, and he felt the Army was taking a little too
                            narrow view if its opposition to the return of these islands was only to
                            secure a radar station.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to expand his comments on his experience in the
                            occupation business. He pointed out that in almost every case the
                            peoples of the occupied areas had come to hate our soldiers, for one
                            thing because they were comparatively rich. But the President said that
                            with regard to our “fortress positions”, or main bases, such as Wake,
                            Okinawa and Iwo Jima, that was a different story.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> warned that
                            Okinawa was becoming a very real problem for the United States. Unlike
                            the other islands, it had a very large population and the Japanese
                            considered it very important for themselves, and were plainly determined
                            to do everything they could to get it back. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said, however, that he was
                            prepared to agree to the return of the Amamis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that this
                            was not the moment to return the Amamis. This return should be timed to
                            extract the utmost advantage from it. As for Okinawa, he felt it was not
                            in accordance with our best security interests to share authority there
                            with the Japanese. He also pointed out that, strictly speaking, we would
                            not be obliged to get out of the Amamis; we could make provision to go
                            back if it proved necessary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then commented
                            that it might be possible to permit the Japanese to take over the
                            administration in Okinawa if conditions ever permitted it.</p>
                        <p>At this point Colonel Carroll, who had left the room to ascertain the
                            answer to the President’s question on the population of the Amamis,
                            returned and reported that they had 219,000 inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated emphatically that to him it was a “must” to
                            return these islands to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAWM1">Fechteler</persName> noted the
                            relationship between this problem and the statement of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> at the signing of the Japanese
                            peace treaty.<note n="9" xml:id="d655fn9">Apparently a reference to the
                                following sentence from <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s remarks to the Conference, Sept. 7, 1951:
                                “I cannot but hope that the administration of these islands will be
                                put back into Japanese hands in the not distant future with the
                                reestablishment of world security—especially the security of Asia.”
                                (Department of State, <hi rend="italic">Japanese Peace Conference:
                                    Proceedings</hi>, p. 277)</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1443" n="1443" facs="0387"/>
                        <p>The President replied that he understood the issue of the timing of the
                            return to Japan of these islands in accordance with the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> statement, but that we must not
                            overlook the question as to where our true interests lie. Maybe, said
                            the President, the time is actually approaching for the return of some,
                            at least, of these islands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested that the
                            Council might agree to accept the State Department position favoring
                            return of the Amami group as set forth in the report, but to leave the
                            implementation of this matter of policy to a future joint decision of
                            Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President, however, reverted to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s statement, and pointed out that it brought up
                            the whole principle of reversion to Japanese sovereignty. That was
                            impossible to carry out at present, but he could see no objections to
                            turning over the small Amami group. He was concerned, however, by the
                            Army’s contention that if we did that Okinawa would be the next to
                            go.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed the
                            thought that the members of the Council would be much surprised if they
                            knew how large a number of American officials were “fooling around” in
                            these islands. (Laughter)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out to the
                            Council that the return of these islands should be calculated and timed
                            in ways that would tend to hasten the process of Japanese
                            rearmament.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s suggested
                            Council action, the President said that the question of implementing the
                            proposed policy of returning the Amami group should not be decided
                            solely by State and Defense, but should be brought before the Council in
                            not more than 90 days. He also emphasized the importance of relating the
                            return of these islands to the development of Japan’s military
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> then pointed out to the
                            Council that recommendation <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss> of the
                            report had budgetary implications of considerable importance, and the
                            Council discussed these for some little time.</p>
                        <p>Among the various costly aspects of our administration in these islands,
                            said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, we were
                            actually involved in setting up a college, not to mention the very
                            peculiar form of local government in Okinawa. We had set up a local
                            assembly there whose principal activity to date had been debating as to
                            when the Americans should be thrown out.</p>
                        <p>The President said it was a matter of considerable distress to him that
                            in many of the colleges established by the United States in foreign
                            countries, there were so many Communist students.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1444" n="1444" facs="0388"/>
                        <p>Concurring, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            pointed out that at the college in Beirut he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> had been warned to avoid a
                            visit, because of fear of demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>, however,
                            expressed the belief that such demonstrations primarily reflected
                            nationalist rather than Communist sentiment.</p>
                        <p>After the Vice President had expressed his concern over the President’s
                            point concerning the hostility which occupation forces seemed to incur
                            wherever they were sent, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> suggested that it would be most helpful if the
                            military could restudy our objectives in these islands with a view to
                            determining how rapidly the military could disengage themselves from
                            civilian activity without harming our military position. Withdrawal,
                            thought Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, was
                            the one sure way to lower the high costs of our administration.</p>
                        <p>While there was much support for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s suggestion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> warned that there was still need for U.S.
                            controls in these islands, and that there was much to be said for the
                            Defense Department position in this dispute.</p>
                        <p>The President, however, re-emphasized his original contention of the
                            inevitable hostility which occupation status involved us in, and pointed
                            out that our own people would feel very much the same way if any foreign
                            forces were long stationed on our soil.</p>

                            of the United States of America in Japan and, with regard to the United
                            States assistance to foreign countries under the Mutual Security Act,
                            has the honor to inform the Embassy that the Ministry, with the
                            knowledge that the Government of the United States is prepared to
                            extend, if Japan wishes, such assistance to her, has been studying the
                            matter from various angles, because of the importance of its effects,
                            and has in this connection further the honor to request the Embassy to
                            indicate the official views of the Government of the United States on
                            the following points:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1446" n="1446" facs="0390"/>
                        <list>
                            <item>(1) The fundamental objective of the United States’ assistance to
                                foreign countries under the Mutual Security Program is understood to
                                maintain and promote security of the free world; and in case when
                                the assistance to Japan under the same program is given, the
                                Japanese Government understands that the afore-mentioned fundamental
                                objective is to be fully accomplished by enabling Japan, through the
                                assistance to be received, to ensure its internal security and its
                                home defense. Is this understanding correct?</item>
                            <item>(2) In so far as the assistance to Japan contemplated by the U.S.
                                Government under the Mutual Security Program is intended to assist
                                Japan’s defense effort, the Japanese Government will deem that, in
                                the consideration of the defense capacities of Japan, the economic
                                stability and development of Japan shall be its prerequisite, Is
                                this understanding correct?</item>
                            <item>(3) It is the understanding of the Government of Japan that, in
                                receiving the assistance referred to above, it is bound by the
                                applicable provisions of paragraph (a) of Section 511 of the Mutual
                                Security Act. In this connection, is it correct to understand:<list>
                                    <item>(a) that the requirements for the fulfillment of the
                                        “military obligations”, as provided under sub-paragraph (3)
                                        of the said paragraph (a) of Section 511, will be met, in
                                        the case of Japan, by the fulfillment of the obligations
                                        which Japan has already assumed under the Security Treaty
                                        between the United States of America and Japan?</item>
                                    <item>(b) that, with regard to sub-paragraph (4) of the said
                                        paragraph (a), the requirements for Japan for the
                                        “development and maintenance of its own defensive strength”
                                        will be sufficiently met if it is carried out to such extent
                                        as permitted by Japan’s general economic condition and
                                        consistent with Japan’s political and economic
                                        stability?</item>

                            Ministry’s Note of June 24, 1953, concerning the Mutual Security Program
                            of the United States, has the honor to state under instructions from its
                            Government that:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. Assistance under the Mutual Security Program is primarily
                                designed to maintain and promote the security of the free world and
                                any assistance for which Japan may become eligible under this
                                Program will be designed to further the main objectives of the
                                Program by enabling Japan to safeguard its internal security and to
                                    <pb xml:id="pg_1447" n="1447" facs="0391"/>exercise more
                                effectively its inherent right of voluntary individual or collective
                                self-defense as guaranteed in Article 5 (c) of the Treaty of
                                Peace.</item>
                            <item>2. In the planning of an assistance program for Japan economic
                                stability will be an essential element for consideration in the
                                development of Japan’s self-defense capacities. While the Mutual
                                Security Program is premised on the assumption by each participant
                                of its full share of the economic requirements involved, it is, of
                                course, understood that a recipient country can contribute only to
                                the extent permitted by its general economic condition and
                                capacities. Moreover, it is expected that the possibility of United
                                States procurement in Japan of materials required for the Mutual
                                Security Program would be increased if Japan decided to participate
                                in the Program.</item>
                            <item>3. Any assistance which may be extended under the Mutual Security
                                Act is conditioned upon agreement with the provisions of Section 511
                                (a) of the Mutual Security Act. The requirements for the fulfillment
                                of military obligations as a condition for the receipt of aid will
                                be met in the case of Japan by the fulfillment of those obligations
                                which Japan has already assumed under the Security Treaty between
                                the United States and Japan. There is nothing in the Mutual Security
                                Program or any existing treaty obligation between the United States
                                and Japan which requires Japan to use its security forces except in
                                self-defense. Sub-paragraph 4 of Section 511 would, of course, call
                                for only such contribution by Japan as would be “consistent with its
                                political and economic stability” and “permitted by its manpower,
                                resources, facilities, and general economic conditions.”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The concept of mutual security is based on the realization that it can be
                            achieved only to the extent that those who receive aid from the United
                            States should do their utmost to help themselves and to cooperate among
                            themselves and with the United States to the fullest degree in achieving
                            the objectives of the free world. It is the affirmed desire of the
                            United States to continue to use its resources for the purpose of
                            uniting the efforts of those countries which receive assistance in order
                            that positive accomplishments toward mutual security be achieved with a
                            maximum of efficiency and a minimum of delay and cost.</p>

                        <p>Statement of Policy by the National Security Council on United States
                            Objectives and Courses of Action With Respect to Japan</p>
                        <p>1. The statement of United States objectives and courses of action with
                            respect to Japan in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/2 (approved
                            August 7, 1952) is reaffirmed.</p>
                        <p>2. In the long term, Japanese economic viability is of critical
                            importance to the security of the United States. This viability will be
                            extremely difficult to achieve. Unrestricted trade with Communist China
                            would not of itself solve Japan’s economic problem. Although Japan may
                            achieve substantial gains in foreign trade, those gains will not, for
                            the foreseeable future, be so great as to remove the necessity for
                            substantial direct or indirect assistance, part of which could come from
                            expenditures in Japan for U.S. forces. (See paragraph 7–c of the

                                omit mention of the subject entirely. “Although similar language
                                included other agreements seems unnecessary retain sentence since
                                purely internal US matter and omission can be explained Japanese on
                                that basis.” (794.5 <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/7–153)</note> and Embassy’s telegram 3, July 1.<note n="2" xml:id="d658fn2">In this telegram, the Ambassador had stressed
                                the eagerness of the Japanese Government to commence negotiations
                                for an <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> Agreement and urgently
                                requested an agreed U.S. draft. He had, however, stated his feeling
                                that it would be “extremely difficult to obtain official
                                confidential agreement by Japanese Government to force goals

                                agreement, either formal or verbal, to meet limited force goals over
                                five-year period or to increase defense forces as political and
                                economic situation permits, is in my opinion best US can expect from
                                approaching negotiations.” The Ambassador concluded that discussion
                                of force goals, while it might take place concurrently with or soon
                                after <gloss target="#t_MDAA1">MDAA</gloss> negotiations, should not

                            was exclusively internal United States matter, as Department seems to
                            indicate, it would be simple matter as relations here between
                            Commander-in-Chief, Far <pb xml:id="pg_1453" n="1453" facs="0397"/>East,
                            and Embassy are good and I should not anticipate any friction whether or
                            not <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is responsible to <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> or Embassy. However, I cannot
                            agree with Department that this is entirely internal United States
                            matter as it is definitely not so regarded by Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Question assignment to Japan of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> as
                            result of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> agreement has often been
                            raised in the press as well as in Diet discussions. Japanese Government
                            officials have closely scanned other <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            agreements and know that in all other cases <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> comes under Embassy. One of principal reasons why
                            Japanese Government has been slow to take definite position on
                            expediting rearmament and on accepting <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> has been real fear of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and others in government that this would
                            inevitably mean domination of civilian elements by the military. This
                            point has also been frequently raised by opposition parties in Diet and
                            elsewhere. Present organization of Safety Advisory Group for Japan,
                            which is under <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>, bears in
                            Japanese mind close relationship to old occupation days and if any
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> group set up as result of ment
                            were also to be under <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> this
                            would increase belief held by many that occupation is only continued
                            under another name. Japanese also Have expressed fear that if <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> kept under <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> group will have tendency to remain large, whereas if
                            entirely new <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> organization set up
                            under Embassy if could be reduced to minimum.</p>
                        <p>There is great sensitivity in Japan over continuing domination of certain
                            fields of activity by US military and while real effort has been made by
                            top US military officials to create understanding of new relationship
                            with Japan, nevertheless it is only too apparent here that many of
                            present US training group adopt parental attitude toward the Japanese. I
                            greatly fear that is allowed to remain under <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> it will only further increase oppostion in Diet to
                            present government policy of cooperation with US and would strengthen
                            hands of those who claim US treats Japan as satellite rather than equal
                            partner.</p>
                        <p>In view of urgency expressed by Japanese Foreign Office officials in
                            beginning negotiations on draft <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            agreement (they have told us they hope agreement can be concluded by
                            July 15), I believe it important we present them with complete draft
                            agreement at earliest possible moment. I am fearful that if we begin by
                            showing Japanese officials draft agreement which omits reference to
                            position of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, it will be difficult
                            for State to obtain later Defense agreement to reinsert this sentence in
                            its present form. While I realize <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> is opposed to this procedure and would so express
                            himself strongly if queried by Washington, nevertheless I do believe
                            there is real matter of principle involved here and that best thing to
                            do <pb xml:id="pg_1454" n="1454" facs="0398"/>is face it. I, therefore,
                            strongly urge Department use all influence at its command to obtain
                            presidential approval for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Japan
                            to be placed under Embassy as it is in every other country. It will be
                            most difficult, if not impossible, to explain satisfactorily any other
                            action to the Japanese.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Government, after having carefully prepared its position,
                            wants aid under <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>. This fact is the
                            upshot of weeks of careful consideration of all angles involved and of
                            testing of political and public opinion. The note exchange of June
                                26<note n="2" xml:id="d659fn2">See despatch 2790 from Tokyo, <ref target="#d656">Document 656</ref>.</note> followed by the
                            Foreign Office request of June 30 to start talks was a crystallization
                            of the Government’s opinion that <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> is
                            politically feasible and economically desirable.</p>
                        <p>The note exchange made public on June 26 was a turning point in the
                            attitude of the Japanese Government not only toward <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> but also toward the problem of defense.
                            The notes cleared the air, pretty well wiped out the inclination for
                            further haggling over the meaning of the word “negotiation”, and turned
                            attention from the desirability of an agreement to the terms of an
                            agreement with the United States. The Cabinet decision to start talks on
                                <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> appears to have strengthened the
                            Government’s position so far as Progressive support is concerned and the
                            Government’s firm attitude should go a long way to obtaining approval of
                            an agreement when signed.</p>
                        <p>The note exchange of June 26 answered a number of questions to the
                            satisfaction of many political figures and the press. First, they
                            appeared happy to be reassured that a mutual security agreement would be
                            intended to contribute to Japan’s domestic security and would impose no
                            requirement on Japan to use its forces other than in self-defense,
                            although critics claim that the United States reply <pb xml:id="pg_1455" n="1455" facs="0399"/>was vague on the meaning of self-defense and
                            could be broad enough to mean creation of military forces which might be
                            sent outside of Japan. Second, the Japanese Government interpreted the
                            United States reply to mean that Japan’s military obligations would be
                            those contained in the Security Treaty and these obligations were
                            promptly interpreted by the Foreign Office to mean only Articles I and
                            II of the Treaty providing for the right of United States forces to be
                            disposed in Japan and for prior approval by the United States before
                            armed forces of other countries could enter Japan. The Foreign Minister
                            also stated in the Diet that the preamble of the Security Treaty, in
                            particular that part regarding Japan’s increasing assumption of
                            responsibility for its own defense, was not an obligation but only an
                            expectation by the United States. Third, the Foreign Office interpreted
                            the United States reply to mean that Japan’s economic position would be
                            considered an “indispensable condition” to development of its defense
                            capacity. Japanese commentators were also quick to point out that the
                            United States reply raised the likelihood of substantial procurement in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Diet and editorial observers nearly all pointed out that the note
                            exchange was silent on the burning issue of increase of Japan’s forces.
                            The Liberal Party claimed that the notes were consistent with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s theory of gradual increase of
                            defense forces, while opponents including the Progressives said that the
                            big string which the United States will attach to <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> is a request for increase of Japan’s
                            defense forces. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that
                            after reading the United States note of June 26 he could see no
                            objection to a <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> agreement but he
                            later stated that Japan should not as a general matter agree to increase
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NSF1">NSF</gloss>. Diet questioners also wanted
                            to know whether a United States military advisory group would be set up
                            in Japan, a point which has been raised a number of times in the Diet.
                            The Foreign Office replied that an advisory group would probably be set
                            up after conclusion of an agreement but would not interfere with Japan’s
                            domestic affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese decision to request talks on <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> has been the result of lengthy consideration. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ statement before
                            Congressional Committees on May 5 that the mutual security program
                            contained funds for Japan took the Japanese public by surprise. They
                            could not understand why the United States was going to give Japan money
                            if their Government had not asked for it, and if there had been no
                            request they could not understand why the United States was going to
                            give them the money. After laborious explanations by Government
                            officials and a flood of statements out of Washington, a somewhat
                            clearer understanding of how <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss> works
                            began to develop. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>’s speech of June 21 <pb xml:id="pg_1456" n="1456" facs="0400"/>cleared up a number of doubts. Foreign Office
                            statements and newspaper articles served to clarify and sharpen the
                            issues. Many important papers remain opposed to <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>, such as <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi>, while others
                            like <hi rend="italic">Nihon Kaizai</hi> say Japan must wait and see
                            what the United States has in mind. <hi rend="italic">Mainichi</hi> has
                            done a great deal to explain the issue and a valuable commentary by
                            Kisaburo Yokota on June 20 was particularly helpful in analyzing the
                            questions most Japanese ask, namely, what are the strings attached.
                            Business groups have for some time been favorable to the idea of <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>. They have put considerable pressure on
                            the Government to take a receptive position. One important influence on
                            popular thinking is the fear that the Korean procurement will shortly
                            end and, therefore, Japan must find a substitute, which they see in
                            United States procurement under <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> fits the Government’s position
                            on defense, especially if interpreted to mean that United States will

                            amendment of the Constitution, or dispatch of Japan’s forces overseas.
                            The Liberal Party has also sought to interpret the United States
                            position to mean that Japan’s economic position will be given prior
                            consideration before measures to strengthen its defense capacity are
                            considered, although this position is probably designed mostly for
                            public consumption.</p>

                        <p>Certain by-products of the <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> debate are
                            also apparent. First, there appears to be a growing feeling held by many
                            Japanese that increase of Japan’s forces will enable United States
                            forces to be reduced and eventually withdrawn from Japan. Several recent
                            newspaper <pb xml:id="pg_1457" n="1457" facs="0401"/>polls appear to
                            support this view. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> also stated that withdrawal of United States
                            forces is an objective of his gradual increase of the defense program.
                            Hitoshi Ashida and other Progressives have been more outspoken along
                            this same line. Second, the Japanese Government remains very wary of any
                            plan for a Pacific defense organization. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> has recently reported his view
                            that Japan’s present system does not permit participation in a broader
                            defense alliance. The action [of] the United States House of
                            Representatives in endorsing the principle of collective security in the
                            Pacific in connection with the Mutual Security Act for 1953 received
                            little attention in Japan. It would appear that the Japanese public is
                            not prepared for collective defense efforts and that Japan’s entry into
                            a Pacific defense organization will require considerable development in
                            Japan of both public understanding and defense capacity before further
                            steps can be effectively considered.</p>

                        <p>On June 30, the Japanese Foreign Office formally proposed to our Embassy
                            in Tokyo the initiation of negotiations for an agreement under the
                            Mutual Security Program. The Japanese Government is anxious to submit
                            the Agreement to this session of the Diet which is scheduled to adjourn
                            in early August.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> has therefore
                            urgently requested the final draft of the proposed Mutual Defense
                            Assistance Agreement with Japan and authorization to initiate such
                            discussions as soon as possible. It had been our preliminary position
                            that an official confidential understanding should be reached with the
                            Japanese Government with respect to force goals prior to the formal
                            negotiation of the bilateral agreement. However, the Japanese have such
                            serious political difficulties on the general question of rearmament
                            that we <pb xml:id="pg_1458" n="1458" facs="0402"/>now believe it should
                            be left to the discretion of the Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> to seek Japanese agreement,
                            either formal or verbal, to meet limited force goals over a five year
                            period or to increase defense forces as the political and economic
                            situation permits. This course of action accords with the recommendation
                            of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Attached is a draft of the proposed Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement
                            (Tab A)<note n="1" xml:id="d660fn1">Not printed.</note> which will serve
                            as a basis for negotiation with the Japanese Government. It follows
                            closely the standard type agreement, with minor deviations to take into
                            consideration Japanese sensitivities with respect to rearmament.</p>
                        <p>The major difference between the proposed draft and the standard
                            agreement is the deletion of a provision that, the Military Assistance
                            Advisory Group will in its relations with the Japanese Government,
                            operate under the direction and control of the Chief of the Diplomatic
                            Mission. This provision is inconsistent with the existing Presidential
                            Memorandum of April 23, 1952<note n="2" xml:id="d660fn2">See the

                        <p>Above statement will obviously be taken up by opposition here and used to
                            castigate government which has firmly maintained no intention to
                            increase present strength of national security forces (which now
                            approximates four divisions). Embassy is at loss to understand statement
                            that “ten divisions is envisaged” in new Japanese budget as such is
                            definitely not the case. In fact Progressive Party is pressing for
                            reduction of 20 billion yen from present budget which is based on
                            assumption of barely maintaining current strength of 110,000 men.
                            Embassy has repeatedly taken public position that United States is not
                            forcing extensive build up in defense force numbers. Indications from
                            Foreign Office are that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            was planning some increase in strength of between 25,000 and 40,000 men
                            during present fiscal year but obviously it will be impossible for
                            Japanese Government to do so if it appears this is being forced by
                            United States.</p>

                        <p>Request urgent clarifying statement by Secretary which believe could be
                            to general effect that ten divisions is ultimate rather than immediate
                            goal and that press statement is based on misunderstanding. It would be
                            extremely helpful if public statement could be made prior to opening of
                                <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> negotiations which is hoped for
                            next week or if that impossible that I be authorized to make in my
                            opening statement clarifying explanation on behalf of United States
                            Government. I believe it extremely important that American officials
                            refrain in connection with <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            discussions from referring to Japanese constitutional problem. This is
                            matter of great internal interest in Japan and while privately we can
                            use our influence to obtain revision any public expressions can only do
                            harm.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> complement and local currency
                            requirements as indicated in reference telegram. As Department points
                            put this would mean Japan would have largest <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. complement in world Whereas Formosa has complement of
                            772 persons to deal with Defense establishment of between 300,000 and
                            500,000, Defense proposes 1,489 for Japan where total Defense
                            establishment over next two years, at most optimistic estimates, will
                            not exceed 200,000. Japanese are extremely sensitive on whole problem of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and this was made clear in
                            first detailed Japan-United States talks on <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> held yesterday. While separate telegram is being
                            forwarded regarding these talks, it is pertinent here to point out that
                            Japanese negotiators immediately picked on Article 5 United States draft
                            and raised question of overall control of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Japanese made definite statement that if <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> were under <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> control it would not be acceptable. United States
                            reserved its position on this for time being, although, at instance of
                            Admiral Hanlon,<note n="2" xml:id="d664fn2">Rear Adm. B. Hall Hanlon, in
                                charge of the Civil Affairs section (J–5) of both <gloss target="#t_FECOM1">FECOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>.</note> pertinent provisions of law i.e. Section
                            507 were read to Japanese.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion Defense estimate is completely unacceptable. I do not
                            believe Japanese Government will accept <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> of more than 500 men and even this is doubtful.
                            Political situation in Japan vis-à-vis American bases and American
                            troops here is such that instead of largest <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in world, Japan should have absolute minimum
                            consistent with carrying out purposes of act. Japanese have tentatively
                            proposed several annexes to <gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>
                            agreement, title of one of which reads “concerning status of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to be sent to Japan under Mutual
                            Security Program”. In this annex Japanese Government will attempt to
                            obtain agreement I am convinced not <pb xml:id="pg_1464" n="1464" facs="0408"/>only as to overall control of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> but as to size. If anything like present Defense
                            estimate is presented it could well kill chances of reaching overall.

                            be victimized by a resurgence of Japanese imperialism”. To preclude new
                            Japanese imperialism President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> recommends that the United States make Korea, not
                            Japan, the keystone of its strategic power in north Asia. Also,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> in a letter to the
                            Secretary of State of July 25 said that the Koreans are deeply concerned
                            about the “eventual reactivation of Japan’s imperialistic designs
                            against <pb xml:id="pg_1465" n="1465" facs="0409"/>us, well-knowing that
                            Japan has not abandoned the conviction that its own aggrandizement
                            cannot be accomplished except by conquest of Korean resources and of the
                            Korean avenue to Manchuria.”</p>
                        <p>This recent approach by President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> reflects the chronic, deep tension between Korea
                            and Japan following the liberation of Korea from Japan in 1945 and is
                            consistent with previous <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> appeals
                            that (1) its army, air force and navy be at least as strong as their
                            projected Japanese counterparts; that (2) United States economic aid to
                            Korea not be used to procure goods from Japan which could be produced in
                            Korea; and that (3) the United States guarantee the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> against Japanese aggression.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Position:</p>
                        <p>After some forty years of severe Japanese domination of Korea, the Korean
                            emotional reaction to Japan and the Japanese is understandable. However,
                            it is necessary for the United States and Korea, both of which suffered
                            from Japanese imperialism, to recognize the realities of the present-day
                            world and look to the future. A Communist Japan would mean great danger
                            to free Korea. It would seriously jeopardize the United States political
                            and military position in the Far East. Everything must be done to help
                            Japan maintain its present orientation in the free world. The United
                            States also recognizes that an authoritarian, ultra-nationalist Japan
                            would be a threat to the interests of free Korea, the United States and
                            the free world.</p>
                        <p>We feel that a profitable and honorable place must be made for Japan in
                            the free world, and that political, economic and cultural relations
                            between Japan and the other free nations of Asia are vital if Japan is
                            to become a full member of the community of nations.</p>
                        <p>We wish to support the responsible, forward-looking elements in Japan
                            which have been in control since the end of the war. We oppose the
                            revival of militarism or any form of totalitarianism in Japan. Economic
                            support and cooperation with Japan are necessary, in order that the
                            Japanese economy can sustain the large Japanese population which is
                            living in an area of too few resources. If Japan goes under, we do not
                            see how Korea can long survive.</p>
                        <p>We would be as concerned over any revival of Japanese imperialism or
                            militarism as the Koreans or any other of our friends and allies in
                            Asia. As we said in our aide-mémoire to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> of May 27, “The United States will
                            take a strong stand against any developments from any quarter that
                            affect the political stability, economic progress and military security
                            of the free countries in that area, including Korea.”<note n="3" xml:id="d665fn3">Not printed. (795B.00/5–2753)</note> This applies
                            both to Japan and <pb xml:id="pg_1466" n="1466" facs="0410"/>Korea. The
                            Mutual Defense Treaty with Korea applies to attacks from any quarter.
                            The stationing of U.S. forces in Japan and in Korea, as well as in other
                            parts of the Far East, is a guarantee that the United States will make
                            good on that statement.</p>
                        <p>At the present time we see no prospect for the revival of Japanese
                            imperialism or Japanese militarism for many years to come. On the
                            contrary, Japan is defenseless, the build-up of Japan’s defense forces
                            is moving along only very slowly, and there is widespread opposition
                            throughout Japan to militarism, to rearmament, and even to the
                            establishment of any self-defense forces in Japan. Furthermore, the
                            Japanese economy is basically not strong. Whatever its superficial
                            appearances may be, only external assistance over several years will
                            prevent its collapse and the inevitable political consequences.</p>
                        <p>The United States feels strongly that both Korea and Japan must use every
                            effort to put their relations on a firm and friendly basis. While the
                            United States is not going to intervene directly in any particular
                            dispute between Korea and Japan, the United States will seek to impress
                            upon both Governments the desirability for a complete change in the
                            present strained relationship.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we can assure the Koreans that we will not tolerate in
                            the future the resumption of any aggressive or oppressive measures by
                            the Japanese in economic, political or military fields concerning Korea.
                            By the same token, we hope that the Koreans will give the present
                            moderate, middle-of-the-road responsible Japanese a chance to show their
                            good intentions both towards Korea and the free world in general.</p>

                            which will lead to the imperialism he fears. The present disparity
                            between some sixteen equipped and experienced <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions and four partially equipped and organized
                            Japanese divisions of internal security forces would speak for itself.
                            We have promised President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to
                            help build up his army to approximately twenty divisions. If necessary,
                            we can tell him that we know that it will be a long time, if ever,
                            before the Japanese reach any such level. However, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> may complain that we have given
                            more naval craft to Japan than to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> navy. This is correct. But we have also agreed to help

                            Secretary’s assurance that the United States will maintain the present
                            Sea Defense Zone around the Korean peninsula. He will desire this in
                            order to keep Japanese fishing vessels at least 50 to 100 miles away
                            from the coast of Korea. In establishing the Sea Defense Zone in October
                            1952, General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> announced
                            that it was for military purposes in connection with the hostilities in
                            Korea. However, the real purpose, never made public and never admitted
                            either to the Japanese or to the Koreans, was to stop a dangerous feud
                            from breaking out between the Japanese and Korean fishing vessels. Since
                            October 1952 the Japanese reluctantly acquiesced in the zone and
                            Japanese fishermen by and large have obeyed General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>’s regulations. Now that the
                            armistice has been signed, the Japanese have asked General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> to lift the Sea Defense Zone as
                            soon as possible. General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>
                            has stated that sooner or later this would be done, but that this would
                            be a proper subject for his discussions during his trip to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Since <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> established the Sea
                            Defense Zone for military purposes, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> should be informed, if he raises the subject that
                            it is a matter wholly within the jurisdiction of the United Nations
                            Command.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> strongly opposes our
                            procurement of goods and services in Japan out of U.S. aid funds for
                            Korean rehabilitation and relief. The U.S. position is that procurement
                            under the U.S. aid program for Korea should take place wherever it is
                            most advantageous for Korea, in order to use the most practicable source
                            to save time and to economize on funds.</p>

                            which was approved by the President, it has been decided relinquish
                            control of Amami group but not to implement this decision or make any

                            review the recommendation of Secretaries of State and Defense within 90
                            days of June 29.</p>
                        <p>My telegram 52, July 6 urged promptest possible action in view danger
                            that any leak would deprive us of immense psychological advantage which
                            we may expect to derive from this decision.</p>
                        <p>We have now learned informally from Japanese Foreign Office official that
                            in his opinion Russians are preparing make bid any day to improve
                            relations with Japan. There have already been several minor gestures and
                            our contact thinks Russians may soon want to talk peace treaty. He is
                            unable to judge whether Russian motives serious or merely for propaganda
                            purposes to exacerbate US-Japan relations. However possibility of some
                            overt friendly gesture by Russians is yet another important reason for
                            us to announce <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision regarding
                            Amami group soonest. If announcement were made only after Russian move,
                            it would look like hasty defensive action on our part rather than
                            genuine initiative by us. Under such circumstances psychological benefit
                            to us would be nil.</p>
                        <p>This morning subject of islands came up in talk I had with Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>

                            Briscoe. They both agreed that if we have decided to take action
                            envisaged in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision, we should
                            move quickly.</p>

                        <p>My staff recommends and I concur that urgent consideration be given to
                            possibility your making announcement in Tokyo this Sunday. If this could
                            be arranged I believe we would obtain maximum favorable reaction.
                            Announcement of this importance while you are in Japan would have
                            additional value of demonstrating you had important mission to carry out
                            in Japan as well as in Korea. I continue to believe it is neither
                            practical nor advantageous to attempt to tie this decision to some
                            specific concessions from Japanese. On the other hand announcement
                            should help in promoting Japanese awareness they are increasingly on
                            their own and therefore must develop capacity for self-defense.</p>
                        <p>This recommendation would require <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            concurrence in waiver of balance of 90 day period. In view dangers
                            involved in waiting full 90 days I would urge that action be expedited
                            in any event even if it should prove impracticable to make announcement
                            this weekend. I trust Department will give you Washington reaction
                            soonest and repeat to me. Believe important announcement should include
                            reference to Okinawa along lines suggested paragraph 3 of reference
                            telegram, particularly regarding plans of administration to take action
                            looking toward improvement in conditions indigenous population.

                            recommendation that we relinquish civil administration over the Amami
                            group to Japan was subject to the understanding that “in view of the
                            current situation in the Far East” implementation would be deferred
                            pending review of the situation by the National Security Council on the

                        <p>2. Now that there is an armistice, it is important that we move rapidly

                            lost if there is any advance leak of our intention to return the Amami
                            group. In addition, there is the possibility that the Russians may make
                            a major gesture of some sort to improve their relations with Japan. If
                            our action on the Amami group follows this gesture, it will appear
                            defensive and will almost completely lose its value, particularly since
                            we are not prepared to relinquish control over Okinawa and the other
                            islands outside the Amami group.</p>

                                close economic and cultural ties that exist between the peoples of
                                these islands and Japan and that residual sovereignty over these
                                islands rests in Japan, the United States has determined that it
                                will not propose that these islands be placed under the trusteeship
                                system of the United Nations.” Also omitted in the version in <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 10 is a résumé of Article III
                                of the Peace Treaty.</note> It emphasizes three points: (a) return
                            of the Amami group as soon as the necessary procedural details are
                            worked out; (b) retention of the other islands during the present
                            international tensions; and (c) reviewing present arrangements <pb xml:id="pg_1471" n="1471" facs="0415"/>for civil administration in
                            these other islands in order to encourage the development of closer
                            economic and cultural ties with Japan. All of these points are
                            consistent with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_Tedul1">Tedul</gloss> 10. President and Secretary
                            Defense have concurred in your making announcement in Tokyo in your
                            discretion with regard to relinquishing control over Amami group and
                            statement on administration Okinawa. Following is suggested text which
                            has been cleared with Defense:</p>
                        <p>“The US intends to relinquish civil administration over the Amami Islands
                            to the Government of Japan as soon as agreement is reached on the
                            necessary understandings involved.</p>
                        <p>“With respect to the other islands included under Article 3 of the
                            Japanese Peace Treaty it will be necessary for the US to continue its
                            civil administration while present conditions of insecurity and
                            instability in the Far East continue. The US will thus be able to carry
                            out more effectively its responsibilities under the security treaty
                            between the US and Japan to contribute to the maintenance of peace and
                            security in the area. Meanwhile the US is reviewing present arrangements
                            for the civil administration of the Ryukyu Islands.”</p>
                        <p>Suggest in discussion with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            before announcement you may wish to make point that the turning back of
                            Amami group increases area of Japanese defense responsibility and thus
                            emphasizes desirability increased Japanese efforts to fulfill

                            of Chief of Staff Far East Command, Admiral Hanlon has expressed to me
                            their unhappiness, which Embassy shares, with final sentence in
                            Department’s suggested statement. In our opinion this could give too
                            much encouragement to irredentist activity.</p>
                        <p>Prior to receipt reference telegram Embassy had also prepared draft
                            announcement. Admiral Hanlon and I have discussed matter with General
                            Weyland and we have agreed on following text which combines certain
                            parts of Department’s text and Embassy draft, as follows:</p>
                        <p>“I am pleased to be able to make in Tokyo the following announcement
                            which I have just communicated to His Excellency, the Prime Minister, on
                            behalf of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>“The Government of the United States desires to relinquish its rights
                            under Article 3 of the peace treaty over the Amami Oshima group in favor
                            of the resumption by Japan of authority over these islands as soon as
                            necessary arrangements can be concluded with the Government of
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>“With respect to the other islands included under Article 3 of Japanese
                            peace treaty, it will be necessary during the present international
                            tensions in the Far East for the United States to maintain the degree of
                            control and authority now exercised. The United States will thus be able
                            to carry out more effectively its responsibilities under the security
                            treaty between the United States and Japan to contribute to the
                            maintenance of peace and security in the area. Meanwhile, the United
                            States will make increased efforts to promote the welfare of the
                            inhabitants both locally and in their relationship to Japan.</p>
                        <p>“The prospective reunion of the Amami Oshima group with Japan, reuniting
                            its inhabitants with their homeland, is a source of gratification and
                            pleasure to the Government of the United States”.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1473" n="1473" facs="0417"/>
                        <p>Subject to Secretary’s wishes and Washington concurrence, we would
                            propose release foregoing at 7:30 p.m. Tokyo time August 8. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> will see Secretary at Embassy at
                            6:30 and unless he objects, which is unlikely, release will be made as
                            soon as he is informed. This procedure will obviate risk of leak which
                            delay till Sunday morning<note n="3" xml:id="d670fn3">Aug. 9.</note>
                            might entail. More importantly it will eliminate possibility of Japanese
                            effort to modify announcement in such a way as to make it appear that
                            return of Amami group is concession obtained by <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> from Secretary in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>Embassy will flash Department as soon as Secretary decides whether to
                            proceed with announcement. I appreciate prompt action Washington this
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> took the
                            opportunity afforded by President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s last remark above to present in broad detail the
                            economic, political and strategic status in Japan of the Far East and
                            the need for President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to
                            change his thinking regarding Japan in order to take account of Japan’s
                            status and importance. The Secretary said that both Korea and the United
                            States should look at the situation as a whole, because it is necessary
                            to recognize that Japan must be allowed to live. If Japan goes
                            communist, Korea will be lost. Since Japan is essentially an industrial
                            economy without adequate resources of its own, it must live on its
                            manufactures and manufacturing capabilities. Unless this process
                            continues under the auspices of the United States and the free world, it
                            will inevitably come under Soviet communism, which desires to control
                            Japan as a workshop for war. The Secretary suggested to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> that he must recognize as
                            a problem of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> national security the
                            necessity for keeping the Japanese economy viable and strong. As an
                            example, the Secretary pointed to the manufacture of locomotives which
                            would take a long time before the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            could establish its own factory to make. Accordingly, it was a good idea
                            to buy them in Japan because that would make them quickly available for
                            the needs of Korea and also give Japan business. Otherwise, Japan might
                            become communist, for it would starve without trade with the free
                            world.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> urged the United
                            States to heed his plea. He said that many Japanese were now going
                            around in the United States asking that many Japanese were now going
                            around in the United States asking that the $200 million fund be used in
                            Japan. He wanted that money to be used in Korea to build up Korean
                            industries. He then pointed to a number of examples where Japan had been
                            used for a source of supply or services which he considered altogether
                            unfair. He said that the military authorities had distributed boxes of
                            Japanese dried fish in Korea when Korea itself produces its own fish,
                            which is much more desirable and edible than the fish in those boxes. He
                            said that he had recently had to send out some 2,000 Japanese
                            technicians and engineers who had been brought <pb xml:id="pg_1475" n="1475" facs="0419"/>into Korea. He mentioned the case of using
                            Japanese technicians to repair the telephone exchange in Seoul. He had
                            asked General Van Fleet<note n="5" xml:id="d671fn5">Lt. Gen. James A.
                                Van Fleet, Commanding General of the Eighth Army in Korea from April
                                1951–February 1953.</note> why Koreans had not been given a chance
                            to do this repair job, to which General Van Fleet had answered that no
                            Koreans were sufficiently trained for that work. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said that it was not fair to employ
                            Japanese and at the same time not train the Koreans for the same job. He
                            was gratified that General Van Fleet had fully understood and agreed
                            with this. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> also
                            mentioned the case of the Japanese dredge for Kunzan Harbor, which
                            General Coulter<note n="6" xml:id="d671fn6">Lt. Gen. John B. Coulter,
                                ret., Director of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Korean
                                Reconstruction Agency.</note> had approved when he was Deputy
                            Commander of the Eighth Army, but which President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had asked to be removed from Korean
                            waters. Therefore, he strongly suggested that the Combined Economic
                            Board should determine what is necessary to buy from Japan and what can
                            be done without from Japanese sources, so that the United States dollars
                            can be used in the proper way, from the Korean point of view.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            appreciated President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s point
                            of view, since it was his responsibility to look out just for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. It was natural for President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to view Japan as a former enemy
                            which had ruled Korea for some time. It was understandable that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, as a life-long
                            patriot, fighting for the interests of Korea, should have such
                            prejudices against Japan. On the other hand, the Secretary pointed out,
                            the United States must take a broad view as the leader in the world
                            struggle against communism. The Secretary explained the general
                            strategic position in the Far East which required holding a position
                            anchored in the north in Korea, which swung through the offshore island
                            chain through Japan, Formosa, and the Philippines, to Indo-China at the
                            other end. If that arc can be held and sufficient pressures developed
                            against the communists, it might be possible eventually to overthrow
                            communist control of the mainland. However, if any part of that
                            strategic position is lost, the whole position will go under. Since the
                            United States must be concerned with the whole position, it must give
                            its attention to Japan in order for Japan to have a chance to live and
                            not turn to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Secretary
                            asked President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to recognize
                            that the United States must have responsibility for spending its funds
                            where it believes they will do the most good, including Japan. He
                            pointed out that Japan now faced a trade deficit of many hundreds of
                            millions of dollars which were made up only by the special procurement
                            of the United States in <pb xml:id="pg_1476" n="1476" facs="0420"/>Japan. Thus, the United States alone was keeping Japan from real
                            economic difficulties. The Secretary said that we would respect and
                            promote President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s desire to
                            spend United States funds in Korea. However, it would not be possible to
                            spend them entirely in Korea since we must spend some in Japan to help
                            Japan. It is necessary to hold both Korea and Japan, since it would not
                            be possible to maintain Korea if Japan is abandoned. There must be
                            strong, healthy economies in both countries. Furthermore, the United
                            States has the responsibility for backing up all the friendly nations in
                            the Far East. We are putting over a billion dollars into Indo-China, and
                            several hundred million into Formosa and Japan and billions into Korea.
                            The Secretary said that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> must trust the United States to expend these funds
                            in terms of the benefit to the total welfare of all these nations
                            together.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> asked the United
                            States to give the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> a chance to
                            handle its rehabilitation itself. If the Koreans can do it in Korea,
                            they should be allowed to. If the Koreans can not do it, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said they would then turn
                            to Japan. But he urged the United States not to build up Japanese
                            industry alone and to spend United States funds in other countries and
                            not in Japan</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then asked
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> how he would
                            propose to keep Japan from going communist, assuming for the moment he
                            were the President of the United States and had the responsibilities
                            which President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> has.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> replied that,
                            first, he would request the Japanese Government to outlaw the Japanese
                            Communist Party and, second, that the United States should tell Japan it
                            would not help Japan if it dealt with the Soviet Union or Communist
                            China. He said that he was opposed to having the United States give so
                            much aid to Japan because in the course of time Japan would become the
                            controlling economic power in Asia. He wanted United States funds to be
                            used for the buildup of the individual economies of the other countries.
                            The Secretary said that the only sound basis for the development of
                            Japan and all the free countries in Asia was in multilateral trade.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> replied that if
                            Japan is built up as the producer and the other countries remain as
                            buyers the others will become “slaves to Japan”. He felt that the
                            building up of the “Japanese empire” would give the United States a very
                            hard time some day.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> was quite wrong if he felt that the United States
                            was aiding Japan just because it had some particular attachment for
                            Japan. That was not the case, at all, since the United States had also
                            fought Japan in the last war. On the contrary, the United States was
                            helping Japan mainly to build it up as part of the whole anti-communist
                            front.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1477" n="1477" facs="0421"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> again referred to
                            his complaint that during the last seven years every dollar for Korea
                            had been spent in Japan and that people are trying to have the new funds
                            spent there also. He explained that these people were not the high
                            authorities but “low level” persons, who can find “a hundred different
                            ways” to buy in Japan. He again urged that we should spend the money to
                            build up Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States could be considered as sort of
                            a general staff for planning for the whole Asian front against
                            communism. The Japanese people have work to do which means they must be
                            able to manufacture and trade. He felt that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> wanted to build up industry in
                            Korea and opposed any international trade with Japan. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said that he did not
                            disagree with all of the general considerations that the Secretary had
                            presented. He was just emphasizing the need to use funds for the
                            construction of industry in Korea instead of using these funds forever
                            to buy materials in Japan, and thus build up Japanese industry. Admiral
                            Sohn then described in some detail the kind of industries that were
                            needed in Korea for its livelihood and defense.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the discussion by saying that he understood
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s point of view and
                            he felt the latter understood his. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> agreed.</p>

                        <p>My Dear Mr. Haydock: In connection with proposals for the negotiation of
                            revision of Article XVII of the Administrative Agreement (which covers
                            criminal jurisdiction arrangements for United States forces in Japan)
                            the question arose whether we should seek understandings with the
                            Japanese in amplification of Article XXIII <pb xml:id="pg_1479" n="1479" facs="0423"/>of the Agreement (which concerns the Japanese
                            obligation to adopt and enforce measures for the protection of United
                            States forces).</p>
                        <p>It has now been agreed between the State and Defense Departments that no
                            attempt should be. made to take up problems arising under the security
                            measures article of the Administrative Agreement in the course of the
                            negotiation of revision of the criminal jurisdiction article. This
                            decision was reached to avoid complicating that negotiation. Our plan is
                            to complete the negotiation of the United Nations Forces Agreement
                            immediately after we have concluded the revision of the criminal
                            jurisdiction article of the Administrative Agreement. It is our hope to
                            postpone consideration of subjects covered in other articles of the
                            Administrative Agreement until after completion of the negotiation of
                            the United Nations Forces Agreement.</p>
                        <p>I assume you will let us know if you run into difficulties in working out
                            arrangements with the Japanese concerning security measures. If
                            difficulties do arise we shall be glad to discuss with you what action
                            the Department of State might take in order to assist in resolving the
                            difficulties.</p>

                            <item>Tokyo’s Despatch No. 237, July 31, 1953:<note n="1" xml:id="d674fn1">Not printed. (493.949/7–3153)</note> Notes on
                                Prewar and Potential Trade Between Japan and Communist China.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The following is for your information:</p>
                        <p>Embassy Tokyo believes that if Japan’s controls on trade with Communist
                            China were relaxed to the levels multilaterally agreed to for the Soviet
                            Union, Japan’s trade with the China mainland would almost certainly
                            surpass that of Japan’s European competitors. The Embassy tentatively
                            estimates that this trade could attain a level of approximately $80
                            million annually in each direction. This figure is larger than Japan’s
                            1952 trade with any other single country except Pakistan, which amounted
                            to $82 million. Estimates <pb xml:id="pg_1480" n="1480" facs="0424"/>by
                            Japanese sources of potential trade with China range from “$100 million
                            or less” by conservative businessmen to figures as high as $250 million
                            annually in each direction, put forth by those who “ignore the unique
                            character of Japan’s prewar commerce with China, as well as the
                            significant changes in the Chinese economy under the communists”.</p>
                        <p>The despatch points out that advocates of increased trade with China have
                            advanced the unrealistically high figure of 25% for China’s share in
                            Japan’s overall prewar trade, adding that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> has recently used the
                            unrealistically low figure of 4.6% for 1934–36 in an effort to minimize
                            the potential importance of future commercial relations with Communist
                            China. The despatch concludes, on the basis of careful examination of
                            the data, that the Chinese mainland’s share of Japan’s total trade, was
                            about 12.5% by value during the 1934–36 period. (In 1952 less than 0.05
                            percent of Japan’s total export trade was with the China mainland and
                            less than one percent of Japan’s imports came from the China
                            mainland.)</p>
                        <p>With regard to the discrepancy between <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s cautious statements on China trade and the
                            outright advocacy expressed by Okano, Minister of International Trade
                            and Industry, the Embassy believes it reasonable to assume that Okano
                            speaks with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s consent and
                            that Okano “has been encouraged to voice his opinions, some of which are
                            highly unrealistic, in order that foreign reaction may be assessed,
                            domestic pressures given a voice, and the groundwork laid for future
                            moves toward the relaxation of controls”. The Embassy anticipates early
                            and determined efforts by the Japanese Government to bring about at
                            least a relaxation of its present controls over trade with Communist
                                China.<note n="2" xml:id="d674fn2">In telegram 437 from Tokyo, Aug.
                                17, the Embassy reported that the Japanese Government had on Aug. 12
                                proposed that 20 items be immediately deleted from the embargo list,
                                if the United States concurred, and had simultaneously submitted a
                                list of 80 additional items for ultimate deletion, also with U.S.
                                concurrence. (493.949/8–1753) No formal request by Japan for an end
                                of the bilateral agreement of Sept. 5, 1952, was reported in

                        </p>
                        <p>The Embassy comments on several factors other than security export
                            controls which are likely to hamper the development of trade between
                            Japan and Communist China: (1) loss of the preferred position that Japan
                            enjoyed in China during the 1930’s; (2) progress toward
                            industrialization in China, with resulting decrease in demand for
                            consumer goods which constituted the bulk of Japan’s exports to China;
                            (3) limited availability of raw materials for export from China to
                            Japan; and (4) the restrictions and complexities inherent in the current
                            system of barter trade.</p>

                            following matters during his appointment with the Secretary at 4 o’clock
                            today.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">United States Statement on Amami Oshima</hi>.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AE1">Araki</persName> expressed the
                            appreciation of his government and his own for the statement which the
                            Secretary made in Tokyo on August 8 regarding the relinquishing of
                            control to Japan over the Amami Island group. He informed the Secretary
                            that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> had
                            called on the Emperor on Tuesday, August 11, and that the Emperor had
                            expressed his appreciation for this act by the United States and had
                            sent his very best respects to the President and the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then handed the Secretary a personal note of appreciation
                            from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d675fn1">Not found in
                                Department of State files.</note> The Secretary expressed his thanks
                            for the gracious remarks of the Ambassador and said that the United
                            States decision to relinquish control over the Amami Island group was
                            the right one, since the islands have little strategic value and since
                            the United States as a matter of policy does not wish to retain control
                            over alien peoples any longer than necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador raised two questions regarding this matter. He said that
                            his government desired clarification of exactly what islands were to be
                            included in the change of status. With the aid of a map, the Ambassador
                            inquired specifically of Okino Erabu and Yoron Island. He said that it
                            was the view of his government that the delineation between the Amami
                            group and the Okinawa group was just south of Yoron Islands. The
                            Secretary replied that his public announcement had been made before all
                            of the detailed arrangements on the relinquishment of control had been
                            completed <pb xml:id="pg_1482" n="1482" facs="0426"/>within the United
                            States Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>
                            explained that the United States would probably use the general formula
                            that the islands which had formerly been part of the Kago Shima
                            prefecture would be relinquished, while the islands that formerly had
                            been part of Okinawa prefecture would not. He also informed the
                            Ambassador that the United States Government was carefully analyzing the
                            exact islands which would fall into these two groups and that this was a
                            matter that would be taken up in the discussions and negotiations with
                            the Japanese Government. In reply to the Secretary’s question, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> indicated that the
                            Departments of State and Defense would probably complete their work on
                            the necessary arrangements within the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, the Ambassador expressed the strong hope of his
                            government that the action regarding Amami Oshima would lead to similar
                            action regarding Okinawa and the Bonins “at an auspicious occasion”. The
                            Secretary then cautioned the Ambassador, and through him, his
                            government, not to press immediately for the return of control over
                            Okinawa and the Bonins because that would confirm the very suspicions of
                            those who had argued against even the relinquishment of control over the
                            Amami group. The Secretary also said that it would be impossible for the
                            United States to relinquish control over such strategic islands as the
                            Okinawa and Bonins as long as the government and people of Japan showed
                            such little interest and were making such small efforts in the security
                            of the area. It would not be right for the United States to let these
                            islands fall into a “vacuum of power” at the present time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was very disappointed over the lack of effort
                            and interest in Japan to develop its own defense or to contribute to the
                            security of the area. He felt that the Japanese were content to let the
                            United States bear the burden for Japan’s protection. He was also
                            disappointed that there had been no revival in Japan of the spirit of
                            sacrifice and discipline required to meet the conditions of the world as
                            we all face them. Japan once had shown great national spirit, which he
                            had expected to reassert itself following the war. The Secretary said he
                            had discussed this whole question with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, who had given him several
                            explanations which were quite unsatisfactory. One explanation was to the
                            effect that increased defense measures were unpopular in the Diet. The
                            Secretary said that no government could expect to establish a position
                            of prestige and respect if it allowed considerations of popularity to
                            determine its national policy. The United States Government has to
                            request legislation from the Congress which is sometimes unpopular,
                            including funds for defending Japan. The Congress might like to
                            eliminate the cost of maintaining <pb xml:id="pg_1483" n="1483" facs="0427"/>several divisions in Japan in order to economize. For
                            his part, the Ambassador explained the Japanese slowness to develop
                            selfdefense forces by pointing out the antipathy of the younger and
                            older people in Japan, resulting from the effects of the war, and the
                            concern of the Prime Minister over Japan’s economic capacity to support
                            increased defense measures.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic Matters</hi>. In this connection the
                            Secretary said he was aware of the Prime Minister’s concern but felt
                            that, on the other hand, the Japanese Government was not making the most
                            of its dollar resources to strengthen its economy for meeting defense
                            needs. The Secretary said that he had had a discussion with Governor
                            Ichimada, who had left with him a memorandum on Japan’s economic
                                problems.<note n="2" xml:id="d675fn2">Not found in Department of
                                State files.</note> The Secretary believed that Japan was
                            squandering its dollars on luxuries at a time when it could ill afford
                            to waste the benefits derived from special procurement. He suggested
                            that the Japanese Government should limit the imports of luxuries in
                            order to channel its dollars into essential uses. The Ambassador
                            conceded that he had no explanation for this matter.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">War Criminals</hi>. The Ambassador asked the
                            Secretary to give this question his personal attention because of its
                            political importance to the Government and the people of Japan. The
                            Ambassador pointed out that the United States had paroled only about 20
                            per cent of the Class B and C war criminals, whereas the Philippines and
                            China had released all of this class of war criminals whom they
                            respectively had held, which had made a wonderful impression in Japan.
                            The Ambassador urged that the United States Government release (as soon
                            as possible) the prisoners it had tried and convicted in order to
                            eliminate one of the unfortunate aftermaths of the war. He said that the
                            Japanese people wished to rid themselves of this matter because it was
                            inconsistent with the “new Japan”. The Secretary stated that he had not
                            been informed as to the details of this problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> explained the workings of the
                            President’s Board of Clemency and Parole and said that the United States
                            Government was processing the applications for clemency and parole just
                            as fast as possible. He also said that, while the United States
                            Government fully realized the political implications for Japan in this
                            matter, it was advisable in terms of American public opinion to deal
                            with each case carefully so as to avoid creating any incident in the
                            United States which might be unfavorable for Japan. The Ambassador also
                            requested prompt action on the release of the “three old men” in Sugamo
                            Prison. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> said that the
                            United States Government was now discussing <pb xml:id="pg_1484" n="1484" facs="0428"/>the question of Class A war criminals with
                            other interested governments so as to reach a decision promptly.</p>

                            United States forces in Japan. The agreement would be an executive
                            agreement, in the form of a protocol to the Administrative Agreement
                            between the United States and Japan. It would substitute a new article
                            for the existing article on criminal jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the negotiation is to carry out an obligation which the
                            United States assumed under the Administrative Agreement. The obligation
                            is to conclude an agreement with Japan on criminal jurisdiction similar
                            to the corresponding provisions of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of Forces Agreement immediately upon the coming
                            into force of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement. The
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement will come into force
                            on August 23, 1953. Excerpts from the record of Senate consideration of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement show that members of
                            the Senate recognized that ratification of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement would oblige the United States to revise
                            criminal jurisdiction arrangements for its forces in Japan (Tab B).<note n="2" xml:id="d676fn2">Excerpts not printed.</note>

                            agreement is that a sending or receiving state may waive its primary

                            initiative or in response to a request for waiver by the other state. We
                            are requesting our Ambassador to work out as authoritative and extensive
                            an arrangement for the waiver of jurisdiction by Japan as is possible
                            without bearing unfavorably on United States–Japanese relations.

                        <p>421. For <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>. I am somewhat surprised and disappointed
                            that Secretary’s answers to questionnaire by Murayama of <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi>, which I assume were drafted by <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, were not cleared with Embassy prior to
                            release. This is particularly true in view of the lukewarm if not
                            hostile attitude toward America constantly displayed by <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi>. These answers are published today in
                            Japanese press under headline “<persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reiterates hopes Japan will boost defense”. While
                            actual answers to questions from American point of view and from normal
                            point of view, are unexceptionable, nevertheless continued reiteration
                            publicly at this time of American desire for Japanese rearmament will
                            not have good effect in Japan. This is particularly true coming so soon
                            after Reston article which exposed fact that Secretary had taken stiff
                            position with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> regarding
                                rearmament.<note n="1" xml:id="d677fn1">

                                    Times</hi>, August 10, 1953, p. 1.</note> Political situation in
                            Japan is so delicate that in my opinion there should be no public
                            statements by American officials regarding desires for rearmament no
                            matter how carefully phrased. I intend as do all other officers of
                            Embassy to reiterate privately to all appropriate Japanese officials our
                            concern over slowness in Japanese rearmament. However, any public
                            statement by United States officials is only taken as interference and
                            is used by opposition and by Communists as stick with which to beat
                            government. I am convinced that steady, quiet pressure on Japanese
                            Government will bring desired result, that constant public pressure will
                            only resuIt in putting up backs of <hi rend="italic">Japanese</hi>
                            Government and <pb xml:id="pg_1486" n="1486" facs="0430"/>requiring them
                            in public to take even more negative attitude than at present.</p>
                        <p>It should also be pointed out that with respect to United States
                            statement of April 13 <hi rend="italic">[15]</hi>

                                    644</ref>.</note> on continuation of procurement in Japan which
                            is mentioned in question and answer series, Japanese have interpreted
                            this as commitment on part of United States Government. This statement
                            has also been interpreted by opposition as being designed to help
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s party in last
                            election and resentment at its publication is, in some quarters, said to
                            have been largely responsible for Liberal Party not obtaining Diet
                            majority.</p>
                        <p>Japanese are particularly sensitive to question of collective security
                            and implication that any participation in collective security
                            arrangements will require use of Japanese troops abroad. While I am
                            convinced that if necessity arose Japanese troops would probably be made
                            available for common good, I believe that any prior public discussion
                            only increases difficulty of achieving this end.</p>
                        <p>In connection with such public statements it is important to bear in mind
                            that up to the present United States Government has not taken Japanese
                            Government into its confidence with regard to United States plans and
                            desires in the Pacific area and that until such time as United States is
                            willing to sit down and talk with Japanese at least as frankly and in as
                            much detail as we have already with Philippines and Korea, Japanese
                            Government will be reluctant to act merely on United States demand
                            without knowing reasons therefore.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> in February 1952
                            unilaterally declared large areas of the high seas surrounding Korea to
                            be Korean territorial waters for the purpose of excluding Japanese and
                            other foreign fishermen from those waters. The validity of this
                                “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line” was never
                            recognized by any foreign nation. In 1952 a number of armed <pb xml:id="pg_1487" n="1487" facs="0431"/>clashes occurred in this area
                            between Korean vessels and Japanese fishing boats. Under the guise of
                            protecting the Korean coasts and our lines of communication against
                            hostile activity, but in reality principally to avoid further
                            Korean-Japanese incidents during the Korean hostilities, <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> on September 27, 1952
                            established the Sea Defense Zone, which included substantial high seas
                            areas bordering on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. (Tab
                                A).<note n="1" xml:id="d678fn1">See <ref target="#d603fn2">footnote
                                    2, Document 603</ref>.</note> Now that there is an armistice,
                            there is no real military justification for a continuance of the Zone,
                            and General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> favors its
                            removal.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after the armistice the Japanese Government made a formal
                            request for its removal.<note n="2" xml:id="d678fn2">On July 29.</note>
                            The fishing industry has great political influence in Japan, and the
                            Japanese Government has been under increasing domestic political
                            pressure on this subject. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will
                            resent any lifting of the Zone, but may object less if it is suspended
                            rather than abolished.</p>
                        <p>While the Japanese and Koreans have conducted sporadic discussions in an
                            effort to solve mutual problems, including fisheries, these discussions
                            have not been broken off. We have consistently refused to be drawn into
                            the negotiations. Continuance of the Zone would clearly appear to be a
                            device to keep the Koreans and Japanese from clashing over fisheries.
                            Thus we would, in effect, be intervening in the dispute and lending
                            implied support to the principle of the <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line. The longer we delay in suspending the Zone
                            the more involved we become.</p>
                        <p>Even at the risk of further incidents it is the belief of <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> that the operation of the Zone ought now
                            to be suspended. It seems better to do it now. Prompt action will help
                            us in Japan, and the Korean annoyance may be somewhat tempered by the
                            time the political conference starts. The Embassy at Tokyo favors
                            abolition of the Zone. The Embassy at Pusan believes that if the status
                            of the Zone is to be modified, it should be suspended rather than
                                abolished.<note n="3" xml:id="d678fn3">In telegram 138 from Seoul,
                                Aug. 11, the Embassy supported this position as follows: “Since any
                                action to abolish sea defense zone can be expected arouse very
                                strong opposition on part President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, it is urged that if such action regarded as
                                necessary from viewpoint our relations with Japan or for other
                                reasons it be taken as inconspicuously as possible and preferably in
                                form of ‘suspension’ rather than ‘abolition’. Latter formula would
                                in any event appear more consistent with fact that armistice
                                represents merely suspension rather than definitive termination of
                                hostilities.” (Attached to the source text)</note>

                                <p>“The President expressed very strongly the view that we should
                                    encourage a liberalization of trade between Japan and China in
                                    terms of non-strategic goods. He felt that trade could be a
                                    weapon on our side and that such trade was indispensable to the
                                    livelihood of Japan.</p>
                                <p>“There then ensued a discussion of general character with
                                    reference to US trade policies.” (Attached to note from

                            answer. That telegram, in substance, would have informed the Japanese
                            that the United States was now willing to have the bilateral agreement
                            lapse by stages. Defense and Commerce, however, were not prepared to
                            have the United States at this time commit itself to eventual
                            elimination of the bilateral agreement.</p>

                            on trade with Communist China.” The attached telegram says, in effect,
                            that the United States is willing to see some readjustments made in the
                            items covered by the bilateral agreement but these adjustments would by
                            no means result in a liberalization of Japanese controls to the
                            multilateral level. It represents the best compromise obtainable without
                            a Cabinet-level review of the question.</p>

                            alternative approaches to that contained in the telegram which would
                            come closer to the Japanese objective of dropping back to the
                            multilaterally agreed level of controls. These would be: (a) to drop all
                            items from the bilateral agreement which are not on U.S. security lists;
                            (b) or to drop the entire bilateral agreement.</p>

                            representations concerning necessity resume nonstrategic exports to
                            Communist China and concerning relationship Japanese trade with China to

                            <item>4. If Japs consider any items on US security lists but not

                        <p>In view statements already made by Japanese Government officials re

                            Japanese trade controls being drastically altered or abandoned. Embassy
                            should ask Japanese Government refrain from statements re US-Japanese

                        <p>1. Three facts are basic to any consideration of the present state of
                            Japanese confidence in American purpose and leadership.</p>

                        <list>
                            <item>a. First, the moderate conservatives who have governed Japan since
                                1946 and who are almost certain to continue to hold power here for
                                the workable future welcomed the new Administration with a faith
                                that was perhaps unmatched within the Free World. In few countries
                                were the dominating forces so anxious for a change in the directions
                                of American policy. Many of them regarded the Communist capture of
                                China as the central fact of the mid-Century and could discern in
                                the older American policy no theory of events capable of dealing
                                with the magnitude of this revolution. And despite certain
                                misgivings about the isolationist and belligerent fringes of the
                                Republican Party, they felt the greater Republican interest in the
                                Far East augured a more balanced world strategy and greater promise
                                of an early end to the Korean War. At home, they had been appalled
                                by the Occupation’s legalization of the Japanese Communist Party; by
                                its encouragement of leftist elements in labor and politics; by its
                                successive Purges which sapped conservative sources of strength; by
                                what they regarded as overzealous experimentation in social reform;
                                by the thoroughness with which the traditional political and
                                economic tendons of Japanese society were severed. They were
                                grateful for the leniency and generosity of the Occupation, for
                                American insistence on exclusivity of Occupation command, and for
                                the American conceptions which underlay the Treaty of Peace. But,
                                the Japanese people, by the fall of 1952, agreed that it was time
                                for a change in the United States.</item>
                            <item>b. The second basic fact is the tremendous post-war dependence by
                                Japan on the United States in a relationship all the more remarkable
                                since it developed without a basic tradition of association to
                                cushion the rubs and rasps of close cooperation. To a degree not
                                generally appreciated in the United States, Japan has put its eggs
                                in the American basket. Their pathological fear of war and their
                                obsessive preoccupation with the blunt problem of how Japan is to
                                live makes every American action, or lack of action the object of
                                immediate attention and minute scrutiny.</item>
                            <item>c. The third basic fact is the almost complete reversal we have
                                been compelled to make in our prescriptions for Japanese policy
                                since the end of the war. Few Americans are conscious of the extent
                                of the change, but all Japanese know of the <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthurian</persName> planning which
                                dissolved their military, destroyed their munitions industry,
                                sponsored their Peace Constitution, and instilled neutralism and
                                pacifism as models for their conduct. Today our planning and their
                                security rests on their abandonment of our earlier preachments. This
                                has left many Japanese with the feeling that the arcs of our policy
                                fluctuate too widely, that our responsibility for their defense
                                rests not only on treaty arrangements but on the miscalculations of
                                our earlier formula, and that we ourselves created most of our own
                                current difficulties in Japan.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>2. Thus, the Japanese received the new Administration with great
                            enthusiasm and very considerable confidence, and there has been in Japan
                            a lesser diminution of faith in our leadership than has been reported
                            from other countries.</p>
                        <p>3. This does not mean that confusion and misinterpretations do not exist
                            or that there has not been an impairment of the hopes <pb xml:id="pg_1493" n="1493" facs="0437"/>that existed last January.
                            The contrary is true; if it is of lesser degree in Japan than elsewhere
                            nevertheless it is serious enough to give us concern. It is my judgment,
                            however, that the doubts and misgivings do not yet affect the person of
                            the President, the respect in which he as an individual is held, or the
                            central purposes of his Administration.</p>
                        <p>4. If, for Japan, I were to isolate a single cause for the uneasiness and
                            anxiety we sense here I would say that it is not our capacity to deal
                            militarily with our enemies that is being called into question but our
                            ability to treat with our friends and allies, at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>5. For the Far East, there is no doubt of the Administration’s desire for
                            peace, but the Japanese are increasingly questioning our ability and
                            determination to control our Asian allies. There is little confidence of
                            either a peaceful retirement or a peaceful victory by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. They regard the Chinese
                            Nationalist Government aloofly and <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Chiang</persName> himself as a man who has lost both country and
                            future. What they fear most however is that the United States may have
                            ceded to both Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Generalissimo</persName> the power
                            seriously to embarrass objectives or even to involve, by unilateral
                            actions, the United States in war. If war should be forced on the United
                            States in Asia, the Japanese know that so inextricably are they bound to
                            us that they could not escape involvement.</p>
                        <p>6. In the United States they sense there may be the same indulgence of
                            Administration allies. They fear a reversion to economic protectionism,
                            or a failure to take those measures which will forestall a recession
                            should there be a Korean settlement and a period of less turbulent
                            peace. They wonder whether our insistence that they maintain China trade
                            controls at a higher level than is enforced by any European nation is
                            not designed more for its effects on the American political situation
                            than on the Korean War. They were alarmed by the decision to postpone
                            for one year trade agreement negotiations and fear that a more liberal
                            trade policy may be sacrificed for the needs of party harmony. If
                            protectionism or recession should befall the American economy, the
                            Japanese know that Japan could not escape its effects.</p>
                        <p>7. In the United States also, inability to control our domestic allies
                            raises the question in Japanese minds as to who is the Voice of the
                            Administration. When the President or the Secretary speaks, the Japanese
                            sense the authenticity and responsibility of their words, but their
                            statements of policy are by definition infrequent. The press and the
                            radio carry other pronouncements by officials whose status and
                            importance are often not easy for the Japanese to appraise and who are
                            not always answered by members of the President’s team. Often an absence
                            of rebuttal appears to imply a <pb xml:id="pg_1494" n="1494" facs="0438"/>degree of assent. From this standpoint, the phenomenon called
                            “McCarthyism” has had an appallingly adverse effect in Japan, not only
                            because it exists but also because the Administration has seemed to them
                            reluctant to challenge it. The reaction of intellectuals and students
                            who claim to see in “McCarthyism” the repudiation or the hypocrisy of
                            the democratic standards preached during the Occupation is well known.
                            More important, however, is the effect on the permanent civil service
                            here. In Japan government policy and attitudes are made, influenced, and
                            carried by the career bureaucracy, and there has been bewilderment and
                            estrangement over what by them is considered the sacrifice of
                            nonpolitical civil experts to partisan political considerations.</p>
                        <p>8. There is a further dimension to the problem of Japanese confidence in
                            American leadership. This involves the deep-rooted hope that a new
                            examination of Japan’s place and needs would be made by the new
                            Administration. In the foreign field, this would mean a recognition of
                            Japan’s place in any Far Eastern settlements, more equal and more open
                            exchanges on the problems of mutual concern, closer cooperation in
                            Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The Japanese are not unaware that for
                            Europe we have developed a network of close relationships with the
                            British and the French, and even with the Germans, that involve
                            continuous consultations, integrated planning, and joint civil and
                            military staffs. They hoped that the Administration would desire
                            something of the sort for Japan. Inside Japan, they expected that a
                            newer American approach would mean a reappraisal of the needs of the
                            Security Forces, a tailoring of those needs to Japanese availabilities
                            in land and facilities, a tempering of short-run military desirables to
                            the longer aspects of an enduring United States–Japan relationship.
                            These hopes have not yet been realized.</p>
                        <p>9. Most of the factors which this analysis prompts me to suggest as
                            useful for American policy in the months ahead seem to me of general
                            applicability. All of them will have salutary effect in Japan.</p>
                        <p>10. Most important, I think, is the continuous affirmation of American
                            purpose and constancy and strength and quiet confidence, such as the
                            President made in his April 16 speech.<note n="3" xml:id="d682fn3">“The
                                Chance for Peace”, delivered before the American Society of
                                Newspaper Editors in Washington. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, 1953</hi>
                                (Washington, Government Printing Office, 1960), pp. 179–188.</note>
                            Only the President can project these qualities as the image of
                            America.</p>
                        <p>11. The basic theme we should exploit and with which we should be
                            inseparably identified is the prevention of war, not the winning <pb xml:id="pg_1495" n="1495" facs="0439"/>of war. A policy to deter
                            war, inspired by American leadership and enlisting the best efforts of
                            the Free World, might well prove the best policy for preparedness for
                            war if preventive attempts should fail.</p>
                        <p>12. Within this theme we should strive for crisper definitions of
                            positive goals for Free World endeavor. Containment and anti-Communism
                            are not enough. Rearmament should never appear as an end in itself.</p>
                        <p>13. In the Far East generally, we must recognize the telescoped evolution
                            our policies have had to follow. We are concentrating here on Military
                            assistance programs, and the emphasis is correct in view of the
                            immediacy of the military threat. We have nonetheless foregone the
                            benefits of preparatory stages of economic and political arrangements,
                            such as <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_EPU1">EPU</gloss>, the Brussels Pact, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and the several arms of the European Community.
                            There, moreover our efforts were assisted by European leaders who moved
                            within a European context and were capable of developing their self-help
                            potentials. In the Far East, there have been no such leaders since the
                            war. The area has become tightly compartmentalized. And our own
                            assistance programs have been unrelated, too exclusively national, and
                            too largely particularized in terms of separate problems or specific
                            emergencies: a wheat grant here, a development loan there, a Point IV
                            program in a third country, and special procurement in a fourth. Over
                            the coming months we should consider whether we can make the attempt in
                            the East that we made in Europe some years ago: a proposal for American
                            aid to supplement the deficiencies of self-help in the development of
                            wider trading areas and multilateral economic and political
                            institutions. The resources we will have available for the task will be
                            smaller but the area’s capacities for absorption of aid are infinitely
                            less and the techniques and practices of modern separatism are not set
                            so deeply. Such a proposal might capture the imagination of the East and
                            break through the log jam which threatens the existence of each of the
                            new states.</p>
                        <p>14. The most important single problem in the Far East is the problem of
                            China. No acceptable formula has yet been evolved in any interested
                            quarter. Neither the ideas of Peking or of Taipei—or of New Delhi or of
                            London—offer much present promise. Tokyo with visible reluctance
                            followed the American lead in maintaining its relations with the
                            Nationalist Government, although it was originally inclined to the
                            British approach and still basically holds to theories of the durability
                            of the Communist capture of China and of the possibility of facilitating
                            the alienation of Peking from Moscow. Recently the Japanese have seemed
                            increasingly disposed <pb xml:id="pg_1496" n="1496" facs="0440"/>to a
                            theory of “Two Chinas”. There may in the future be something workable in
                            this.</p>
                        <p>15. For Japan itself, much remains to be done. We should seek the removal
                            of the last of the Occupation residues. We should aim for an inverse
                            ratio of personnel to policy: the number of official Americans, both
                            civil and military, in Japan should decrease while the ties of
                            long-range collaboration and interdependence increase. There have been
                            times since the end of the Occupation when the reverse has seemed to be
                            occurring. We should ask those Americans who remain, or who visit here
                            briefly, to refrain from public tutorials; we will maintain quiet and
                            persistent pressure for our objectives behind the scenes. We should seek
                            to restore our reputation for non-intervention in Japanese domestic
                            affairs. We do not practice party politics abroad, and in Japan where
                            the hold on power of friendly, moderate conservatives is not likely to
                            be broken there should be no exception to our practice. We should seek
                            to develop with Japan closer coordination, franker exchanges, and fuller
                            participation in Far Eastern planning. If we do not arrange for
                            consultation with the Japanese on the basic range of Far Eastern
                            problems, we shall convince them either that we have condemned them to a
                            second-class associate or that we have nothing much to offer in the way
                            of ideas. We should remember that the Japanese have historically
                            responded to a policy of confidence, trust, and equality of treatment;
                            while they have historically revolted against mistrust or the appearance
                            of a Western concert indifferent or disdainful of their interests. A
                            bedrock of confidence in cooperation with the United States and of
                            identification of Japanese policy with the future of the Free World
                            exists today in Japan. We have only to sweep away a rubble of
                            uncertainty.</p>

                        <p>In the course of the Secretary’s press conference held on September 3,
                            the following exchange occurred:</p>
                        <p>“Q. Mr. Secretary, can you give us some comment on the Japanese defense
                            program?</p>
                        <p>“A. Comment on the Japanese defense program?</p>
                        <p>“Q. Yes.</p>
                        <p>“A. I would say that it is the hope of the United States that the
                            Japanese Government will take more vigorous measures than they have yet
                            taken to provide for their own internal security. We feel that too much
                            of a burden is being thrown in that respect upon the <pb xml:id="pg_1497" n="1497" facs="0441"/>United States and that Japan,
                            with its population of 85 million, could make a greater contribution
                            toward its own security than it is now doing. We realize the difficulty
                            and complexity of the problem, the difficult economic position that
                            Japan is in. I would say in that respect that the difficult economic
                            position has not led the Japanese to adopt a very severe austerity
                            program. They seem to find money to spend in other ways which perhaps
                            are not as essential as security, and to throw upon the United States a
                            greater burden in that respect. I do not think we should be expected to
                            carry that burden indefinitely. I think these matters are being worked
                            out, will be worked out, because I think that the Japanese people surely
                            want to feel that they are carrying their fair share of responsibility
                            for their own security. There is no proposal or desire to have the
                            Japanese create a great army. Such a thing is not permissible under the
                            Constitution, but from the standpoint of having a sufficient force there
                            to preserve internal security against possible inroads and action of a
                            subversive character, I believe that there is need of a somewhat greater
                            Japanese security force than now exists.” (Department of State, News

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I think <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> is sending
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, the ablest and most
                            trusted of his associates to Washington to see whether, in spite of
                            constant advice to contrary from Embassy here and Japanese Embassy in
                            Washington, the climate may not be right for <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> economic assistance and large loans to stabilize the
                            Japanese political and economic situation. (The press has carried
                            inspired stories about a billion dollar “political loan”). As secondary
                            matters, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will probably urge
                            either postponement or a very favorable <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement; relaxation of China trade controls;
                            relaxation of United States pressure for higher force goals; special
                            United States assistance to develop Japanese-Southeast Asian trade; and
                            the exertion of <pb xml:id="pg_1498" n="1498" facs="0442"/>United States
                            influence in claimant countries to reduce their reparation demands.
                            About the only specific thing we think he will offer on Japanese side is
                            an increase in ground forces of 20,000 to 40,000 during year beginning
                            April 1954, and an increase in the defense budget of some 20 billion
                            yen, and he will regard this as substantial concession to United States
                            demands. He will talk of Japan’s mounting economic difficulties and will
                            not hesitate to admit shortcomings in Japanese financial and economic
                            policies. He will probably indicate that plans are being formulated
                            behind the scenes to correct these. For example, Finance Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Ogasawara</persName> told me the
                            government was considering some form of credit controls. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will also probably tell about
                            current efforts to form a Conservative coalition in order give Japan a
                            stronger government to carry out these reforms.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> hopes <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will receive enough encouragement
                            in Washington along the lines of his proposals to report back that
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> can undertake his
                            visit with every hope of success. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> would then go to Washington in the expectation
                            of concessions which would put him in a better position to dominate any
                            possible coalition, or to govern without it if a coalition should fail
                            to materialize.</p>
                        <p>3. We are sure <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will argue his
                            case with skill and prizes he will hold out—i.e., increased ground
                            forces and greater political and economic stability—will sound tempting.
                            Because I know the Department has no present intention of making
                            concessions along these lines the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> visit may serve no constructive purpose, might
                            cause <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> to postpone his
                            visit and possibly precipitate mutual recriminations that will impose
                            most serious strains on our relations.</p>
                        <p>4. There are, however, constructive possibilities in the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> visit if we are well prepared for
                            it and know what we want it to achieve. With this in mind I think our
                            main emphasis should be on driving home in unmistakable terms our alarm
                            over the drifting character of Japanese Government’s financial and
                            economic policies.</p>
                        <p>5. In recent months there has been a consumption boom in domestic market;
                            at same time evidence is accumulating of serious deterioration
                            underneath surface of this prosperity. Inflationary pressures are
                            accelerating by reason of past shortcomings in governmental policy,
                            i.e., tax reduction, deficit financing, bank loans in excess of
                            deposits, easy credit facilities, non-essential investment, too high a
                            proportion of increased production going into domestic consumption,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>6. In this situation the latest Embassy estimate of special dollar
                            earnings for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1954 shows they may reach
                            between 1 and 1.3 billion dollars compared with 816 million <pb xml:id="pg_1499" n="1499" facs="0443"/>last year. Given prudent
                            economic and financial policies these special dollar earnings could be
                            of the greatest long-term benefit to Japan and could help prepare her
                            for the time when this windfall declines. But there is no evidence of
                            any disposition by this government to be prudent. In the absence of wise
                            policies these higher special dollar earnings are only adding to the
                            inflationary pressures and maintaining an unhealthy domestic boom.
                            Japanese exports, already handicapped by high prices, will encounter
                            still greater difficulties and the already strong inducement of
                            producers to sell in the soft domestic market rather than seek markets
                            abroad will be encouraged. We therefore, anticipate a further increase
                            in Japan’s foreign trade deficit.</p>
                        <p>7. Thus the rising special dollar earnings which could greatly strengthen
                            the basic economic structure of Japan are actually contributing to its
                            difficulties. They invite and make possible continued refusal by the
                            government to face up to economic problems. Moreover, the higher the
                            level of special dollar earnings in the face of deficient financial and
                            economic policies, the more difficult will be the ultimate readjustment
                            when special receipts begin to dwindle. This combination of high special
                            dollar earnings and lack of action by Japanese Government is building up
                            to situation which one day will culminate in economic crisis, endanger
                            the moderate conservative forces, and compromise the whole policy of
                            United States–Japan cooperation.</p>
                        <p>8. The present government brings to these problems the attitude of a
                            prodigal, wasteful of its substance and confident that the United States
                            will bail it out through special procurement, Korean rehabilitation, or
                            new loans. Moreover, our recent lack of coordinated policy in
                            programming these special dollar earnings has contributed in no small
                            measure to this state of affairs.</p>
                        <p>9. It seems to me what we need is a changed emphasis in United States
                            policy, and that <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s visit
                            provides a suitable opportunity to develop the following:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) If Japan-United States relations are to be put on an enduring
                                basis, our joint self-interest requires that the defects in Japan’s
                                present policies listed in paragraph 5 be corrected. Since I have no
                                confidence we can accomplish this by exhortation, and continual
                                public exhortation will be self-defeating, we should only allow the
                                higher flow of special dollar earnings to continue if the Japanese
                                Government begins soon to deal with these defects. If it does not,
                                we should take positive steps to reduce the volume of these earnings
                                in order to compel remedial action. This will require much more
                                coordination in Washington on defense and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> expenditures in Japan than now exists.</item>
                            <item>(b) Until remedial measures are adopted we should make no further
                                dollar loans except for cotton and the pending thermal power <pb xml:id="pg_1500" n="1500" facs="0444"/>application. When sound
                                policies are adopted we should be prepared to consider further
                                dollar loans or economic assistance.</item>
                            <item>(c) Our recent emphasis in Japan has been concentrated almost
                                exclusively on an expansion in defense forces. While maintaining
                                pressure in this regard, we should also devote much more attention
                                to getting Japan to adopt corrective economic and financial
                                measures. I suggest this partly because I do not think we can at
                                this time induce a substantially greater effort than is now
                                contemplated here for next year although I think we can do perhaps a
                                little better than is indicated in paragraph 1 by hard bargaining
                                with <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> funds. More important
                                however, is fact that unless Japanese can be induced in some way to
                                shore up their economic base, development of sound defense structure
                                is impossible.</item>
                            <item>(d) I feel strongly it will be major mistake not to proceed
                                immediately to negotiate a <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss>
                                settlement along lines of German settlement while special dollar
                                earnings are still high and rising. The moment there is any marked
                                decline in these dollar earnings or the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> forces lose power, it will become
                                extraordinarily difficult if not impossible to negotiate any
                                settlement whatever. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> has hinted he may put forward some interesting
                                proposals on how a <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss>
                                settlement might be used in conjunction with a regional approach to
                                Southeast Asian development; if he does, we should give close
                                consideration to this point. Embassy hopes to be able furnish more
                                details this point before <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s arrival in United States.</item>

                                relaxation of China trade controls as indicated in Secretary’s
                                recent press conference,<note n="3" xml:id="d684fn3">
                                    <p>The
                                        following exchange occurred during the Secretary’s press
                                        conference held in Washington on Sept. 3:</p>
                                    <p>“Q. Mr. Secretary, in connection with the Japanese economic
                                        problem, there have been some stories from Tokyo that the
                                        Japanese Government has asked us to approve wider trade with
                                        Communist China, both as to its extent and types of
                                        items.</p>
                                    <p>Can you comment on that?</p>
                                    <p>“A. The matter is primarily for the Japanese themselves to
                                        determine once you get beyond the category of strategic
                                        goods or goods which are listed under the Battle Act as of
                                        such a character that trade in them with Communist areas
                                        might lead to a cutting off of economic and military
                                        support. Actually today the Japanese have voluntarily
                                        adopted far more drastic restrictions on trade with
                                        Communist China than any other country except, I believe,
                                        the United States and Canada. Other countries are doing
                                        business with Communist China in terms of non-strategic
                                        goods which Japan, as a matter of its self-denying
                                        ordinance, is not doing. It is quite possible that the
                                        Japanese might want to put their relationship on a basis
                                        more nearly that of the other countries such as Britain,
                                        France and so forth. That would be understandable and I
                                        don’t think we could seriously object to it because it would
                                        not involve a violation of the spirit or letter of the
                                        Battle Act.” (Department of State, News Division, “News
                                        Conferences of the Secretary”, vol. XXIV, 1953–1955, under
                                        date)</p>
                                </note> I do not think this will be a problem in
                                the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> visit.</item>
                            <item>(f) If our overall commitments permit we should seriously consider
                                informing <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> that if Japan
                                adopts sound policies, so that one can look forward to the time when
                                the yen might be convertible, the United States would then be
                                prepared to consider a stabilization credit to make convertibility
                                possible. This might be considered <pb xml:id="pg_1501" n="1501" facs="0445"/>in connection with a similar conference with the
                                British on the problem of the convertibility of sterling.</item>
                            <item>(g) In short what I am prescribing is another dose of <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>’s medicine, which enabled
                                Japan to surge forward so remarkably between 1949 and 1951, as a
                                condition of further United States special direct assistance.
                                However, it is important to remember that Japan is not now an
                                occupied nation and that it will not take this medicine merely upon
                                demand.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>10. Both the presentation we think <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will make and our suggested approach are attacks
                            from different points of view on the weakness, drift, and instability
                            which exist here:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s point of view
                                what he hopes to get from the United States is the increased
                                strength he has not yet been able to summon from inside Japan to
                                compel coalition, attract more support, or win an absolute majority
                                for his Liberals in a new election. With time purchased by United
                                States loans and pork barrel persuasion financed by United States he
                                would be, he would claim, be in a position to address himself more
                                seriously to Japan’s problems.</item>
                            <item>(b) As we see it, if we fell in with this <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> plan of underwriting their shortcomings, it
                                is almost certain effect would be to postpone once again the taking
                                of unpopular measures, with a consequent further deterioration in
                                the underlying economic situation and to the detriment of long term
                                United States–Japanese relations. Meanwhile United States political
                                influence in Japan would continue to be mortgaged to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s personal machine and our
                                intervention in his behalf not only could contribute further to
                                antiAmerican sentiment which has risen here in recent months, but
                                also could become the issue which would split the moderate
                                Conservative field beyond possibility of early
                                reconciliation.</item>
                            <item>(c) Frankly we do not know whether the factionalism and personal
                                animosities (particularly those directed against <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>) that now divide the
                                Conservatives can be resolved. However, it may well be that United
                                States pressure for economic reform would promote closer
                                Conservative cooperation in and out of the Diet. In any event it
                                seems to me that our policy should be directed to ends that make
                                sense in themselves, and which have the merit of being endorsed by
                                the most responsible elements0 in Japan.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>11. This much, however, is clear. A basic assumption of our Pacific
                            policy since the war has been that Japan would become a stabilizing
                            power both economically and politically in the Far East and was thus
                            vital to the defense of America and the free world. A continued drift in
                            current policies will delay the time when Japan can fulfill that role
                            and will compel us to resort to an unending series of measures to
                            provide dollars to keep Japan going. Japan must take remedial measures
                            and our best hope of getting the government to do so is by a combination
                            of compulsion and inducement such as suggested in this telegram.</p>

                                We resisted to last inclusion word “normally” and accepted it <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> when clear no other way to get
                                “material importance”. Japanese insisted “normally” essential to
                                make paragraph politically palatable, although we considered it
                                superfluous since paragraph as whole explicitly gave Japanese
                                unilateral discretion to determine whether a specific case is of
                                “material importance”. Believe Japanese accepted this and believe
                                addition word “normally” will not in practice make any difference in
                                implementation waiver paragraph.</item>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_1503" n="1503" facs="0447"/>
                            <item>(b) “Material importance” considered substantially equivalent to
                                “particular importance”. In view difficulty negotiations on waiver
                                issue, we felt fortunate obtain any modifier. Word “material”
                                suggested by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                representative.</item>
                            <item>(c) Notification of waiver also deemed acceptable, although
                                addition of sentence referring to principles of protocol paragraph 3
                                may raise possible ambiguities. However, in view US commitments
                                paragraph one, Article 17 administrative agreement, we felt it
                                impossible refuse to accept Japanese suggestion of sentence
                                regarding principles of paragraph three, in return for Japanese
                                agreeing substance our proposals on notification. We construe
                                sentence regarding principle as going only to fact that Japanese
                                will have discretion to choose what particular off-duty cases they
                                will try, and not as requiring US military authorities to await
                                notice of waiver of jurisdiction before going ahead with preparation
                                for trial and trial of off-duty offender. <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> representatives feel pressing for clarification
                                this point would endanger understandings.</item>
                            <item>(d) Regarding your 589 this point, we have had general
                                understandings with Japanese for some time, subject to reaching
                                agreement on final language, that time limitation on notification by
                                them will be time it takes us to reach verdict on case. We have
                                further requested and they have orally agreed that as a matter of
                                course we would be notified before trial commences and we have
                                informed them that in all serious cases, involving general
                                courtmartial, it will take generally 20 to 25 days to bring case to
                                trial. <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> representatives would
                                prefer to leave any more definite time limitation understandings to
                                be worked out in the joint committee, if and when that becomes
                                necessary. We have all assumed original instructions do not preclude
                                type of understandings described above.<note n="6" xml:id="d685fn6">Pertinent information concerning final negotiations on

                            arrangements unclassified if recorded only in the records of
                            jurisdiction subcommittee of joint committee, and if distribution is

                            decision by local procurator that case is of “material importance” will
                            be referred to Justice Ministry in Tokyo for decision whether to take
                            jurisdiction. We believe this is acceptable handling of waiver
                            agreements. If arrangements do in fact leak, opposition parties <pb xml:id="pg_1504" n="1504" facs="0448"/>should not be able to make

                        </list>
                        <p>The United States has given Japan economic assistance since World War II
                            amounting to $2,045.6 million, of which about $42.3 million relates to
                            surplus property type claims. These data are the best available, but
                            they do not represent strictly accurate accounting data. Furthermore,
                            there are possible deductions from these amounts which may be
                            negotiating points.</p>
                        <p>The legislation making the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss>
                            funds available did not require repayment and there has never been a
                            formal undertaking by the Japanese with respect to compensating the
                            United States for this assistance. On occasion, the Departments of
                            States and Defense informed the Congress that repayment from the
                            Japanese would be sought, but there has been no commitment with respect
                            to the amount and terms of the settlement. For that reason any
                            settlement of these United States claims will need to be discussed with
                            the appropriate Congressional Committees. The Department of State
                            considers that settlement should take the form of an executive
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State has consistently followed the policy of
                            negotiating surplus property settlements on the basis of 100% of sales
                            value, and feels it necessary to follow the same policy in the Japanese
                            case. Accordingly, it is proposed that after the total payment to be
                            made by Japan on account of postwar economic assistance is determined
                            and agreed with the Japanese, two agreements be written, one along
                            surplus property terms covering the obligation of about $42 million, the
                            other covering the remaining major portion of the claim.</p>
                        <p>The terms of settlement with Japan have been the subject of occasional
                            discussions interdepartmentally for more than two years. It was, for
                            instance, discussed in the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on
                            October 17, 1951, <pb xml:id="pg_1506" n="1506" facs="0450"/>along with
                            the German problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d686fn3">The Council, which did
                                not meet on Oct. 17, 1951, discussed this subject at its 184th

                            Two major interdepartmental differences have prevented agreement being
                            reached as yet, namely, the amount which Japan shall be obligated to
                            repay and the relation of the settlement to the defense program of
                            Japan. When the Treaty of Peace with Japan was negotiated, the United
                            States contended that Japan could not pay reparations without putting a
                            burden on the United States. The Treaty, as executed, provided for
                            reparation payments in the form of services supplied by Japan.
                            Reparations settlements under the Treaty have not been accomplished with
                            any country, and the problem constitutes an obstacle to expanded
                            Japanese trade with Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The German settlement is likely to become a precedent with respect to the
                            amount of the proposed settlement with Japan. Total claims against
                            Germany amounted to approximately $3.2 billion. The total obligation
                            assumed by Germany under the agreements was $1.2 billion, of which about
                            $200 million represented surplus property sales, and the balance other
                            claims arising from postwar economic assistance. The surplus property
                            portion was settled on the basis of the full amount on terms similar to
                            other surplus property settlements, i.e., 30 years at 2 3/8 percent. The
                            major portion of the settlement, however, was funded over a period of 35
                            years at an interest rate of 2 1/2 percent. A 5–year grace period on
                            repayment of principal applied to both portions.</p>
                        <p>If the claim on Japan were to be settled on similar terms, the principal
                            amount would be about $750 million, with annual payments of interest and
                            amortization amounting to about $35 million. It seems probable that the
                            longer the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement is
                            postponed the weaker the United States position will be. It is
                            appropriate to proceed at this time inasmuch as the Japanese have
                            suggested that the whole range of economic problems between the two
                            countries be discussed during the visit of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Hayate Ikeda</persName> starting about September
                            17. These problems, in addition to post-war assistance, include defense,
                            trade, reparations and U.S. aid. This provides an opportunity to discuss
                            this subject and other economic problems in their relation to each
                            other, and at the same time provide for the possibility of an early
                            settlement of post-war economic assistance.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Willis<note n="2" xml:id="d687fn2">George H. Willis, Acting Secretary
                                of the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and Director, Office of

                            for the Council the problem of the settlement of U.S. postwar economic
                            assistance to Japan (see <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Document

                                </ref>.</note> He noted that the Japanese settlement had not
                            previously been considered by the Council although it had been mentioned
                            in late 1951 in connection with the settlement of German postwar
                            economic aid. He explained that a forthcoming visit to the United States
                            of a senior Japanese official presented a favorable opportunity to
                            consider the Japanese settlement along with other problems of
                            U.S.-Japanese relationships. He added that principal past
                            interdepartmental differences on the terms of a Japanese settlement
                            revolved around whether the German settlement should constitute a
                            precedent for the Japanese settlement. He noted that while the German
                            settlement covered private as well as public debts, the Japanese have
                            already reached an agreement with their private creditors. The Staff
                            Committee had been advised by the State Department that any proposal for
                            settlement would be discussed with the appropriate Congressional
                            Committees and that the State Department proposed to effect settlement
                            by means of an Executive Agreement. The Staff Committee was recommending
                            a flexible action providing for settlement on the best terms that can be
                            negotiated, but not less favorable to the U.S. Government than those of
                            the German settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. O’Hara<note n="4" xml:id="d687fn4">Robert E. O’Hara, Chief of the
                                Foreign Programs Branch, Budget Division, Office of the Secretary of
                                Defense.</note> stated that the Defense Department discerns two
                            points of difference from the German case. First, in the German case
                            there was considerable evidence of German willingness to participate in
                            defense measures, a factor that was taken into account <pb xml:id="pg_1508" n="1508" facs="0452"/>in arriving at the final
                            terms of the settlement. No similar willingness is now evident in the
                            case of Japan. Second, German resources for payment of international
                            obligations are considerably greater than those of Japan. This factor
                            may constitute to some extent an offset to the first point of
                            difference. He continued that it was the view of the Department of
                            Defense that the U.S. negotiators should take account of this difference
                            in attitude toward defense efforts and should accordingly seek better
                            terms for the U.S. Government in the case of Japan, and that equitable
                            treatment of the Germans requires the U.S. to obtain better terms from
                            Japan than it did from Germany.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> indicated that the
                            State Department has reason to believe that the Japanese attitude toward
                            defense may recently have undergone a change, so that it was possible
                            that the U.S. negotiators would find a situation at the time of the
                            negotiations in which the distinction cited by Mr. O’Hara would no
                            longer exist.</p>
                        <p>Without further comment or discussion the Council unanimously approved

                        <p>Significant points developed during course of conversation were as
                            follows:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. Ability of Japanese to increase personnel of National Safety
                                Forces limited by fact that conscription impossible without revision
                                of Constitution and that present laws make no provision for creation
                                of reserve system.</item>
                            <item>2. Revision of Constitution dependent upon education campaign
                                bringing home to Japanese people facts of life in present world and
                                necessity for adequate defense system. <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kimura</persName> agreed with our contention that Japanese
                                Government had so far been deficient in carrying out such
                                educational program but claimed necessity was realized and
                                government would take definite steps in this direction in future. He
                                expressed opinion, in response to General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>’s question, that it would
                                probably take about three years to get Japanese public in proper
                                frame of mind so that there would be reasonable chance of
                                Constitutional revision being approved by national referendum as
                                required in Constitution. <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kimura</persName> claimed that premature attempt at revision
                                ending in failure would set back progress several years. In
                                meantime, government would have to depend on voluntary
                                enlistments.</item>
                            <item>3. Prerequisite to strong defense structure and to conduct of
                                educational campaign among people is, according to <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kimura</persName>, merger to coalition of
                                Japanese Conservative Parties. <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kimura</persName> reverted to this point several times during
                                conference. In response to my query, he stated he has reason to be
                                optimistic at prospects of such merger and hoped it might eventuate
                                in near future. He cautioned, however, that this was most delicate
                                and that we should treat statements of his on this question as “top
                                secret.”</item>
                            <item>4. Toward end of conference <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kimura</persName> stressed point that quality rather than
                                quantity was desirable element in National Safety Force and that
                                this depended upon spiritual awakening of people and their
                                realization of necessity of defending themselves against any form of
                                direct or indirect Communist aggression. <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kimura</persName> referred to activities of <gloss target="#t_Sohyo1">Sohyo</gloss>, college professors and other
                                intellectuals who are spreading anti-American and anti-rearmament
                                propaganda throughout country with considerable effect. He said
                                government was particularly concerned with activities of National
                                Teachers Union, which has large funds at its disposal for use in
                                this manner, and that Cabinet was now considering what action could
                                be taken to limit activities of this union.</item>

                        <p>Detailed memorandum of conversation will be airpouched.<note n="2" xml:id="d690fn2">Not found in Department of State files.</note> It
                            is hoped result of today’s conference attended by <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> will make possible forwarding
                            of specific information as to Japan’s intentions.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, yesterday’s meeting was most helpful, as for first time it
                            put squarely up to Japanese American position concerning force goals as
                            well as Japanese financial contribution to its own defense.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1513" n="1513" facs="0457"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> made clear that in
                            United States opinion ultimate ground force of around 300,000 men to be
                            attained by annual increments of 50,000 was deemed essential. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> added that Japanese
                            plans for sea and air defense forces appeared more nearly in line with
                            US thinking. I stressed United States belief Japan’s economy would
                            permit immediate expenditure of 3 1/2 percent of national income on
                            defense, as contrasted to present 2 percent, and that this amount should
                            gradually increase to maximum of 5 percent. It was made clear that even
                            this amount was considerably less than that being spent by any other
                            country receiving American military aid and that it would be difficult
                            to persuade American Government and Congress that Japan was serious
                            unless it made a contribution to its own defense of approximately this
                            magnitude. Our statements were received in most friendly spirit by
                            Japanese and I believe they will be passed along immediately to
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> in effort by <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kimura</persName> to convince <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> that present Japanese thinking on rearmament
                            problem is entirely inadequate.</p>

                                found the release disappointing in that suggestions for a stronger
                                statement concerning jurisdiction arrangements had been rejected by
                                the Japanese, but also stated that it believed “it obvious to those

                            holding Japanese to maximum notification period ten-fifteen days,
                            suggest Japanese be offered extension in cases in which they request it.
                            Might then have fifteen day maximum with extension up to ten-fifteen
                            more days upon Japanese request. Necessity for fairly short time period
                            should be readily explainable Japanese on administrative grounds. Any

                            provided under their law should be taken care of by their right request

                            formulate a long-range defense program which is in keeping with the

                            self-defense force and to give it the duty of defense against direct

                                    the section entitled “United States Position” reads as
                                    follows:</p>
                                <p>“1. The U.S., with the exceptions noted below, is not in a
                                    position to extend direct U.S. loans to Japan;</p>
                                <p>“2. for loans from public lending institutions, Japan should rely
                                    primarily on the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>; the
                                    Bank’s attitude towards loans to Japan, however, is strongly
                                    influenced by Japan’s efforts to put its internal economy on a
                                    sound footing; the U.S. supports extension of a $40 million
                                        <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> credit for thermal
                                    projects, but cannot commit itself on other projects in
                                    advance;</p>
                                <p>“3. Japan is generally able to build the necessary plant and
                                    equipment to undertake its development, supplemented by
                                    relatively minor amounts of imported materials, equipment and
                                    services; loans should be sought only to the extent actually
                                    needed; unnecessary burdening of Japan’s balance of payments for
                                    the future should be avoided;</p>
                                <p>“4. the Export-Import Bank is willing to consider requests for
                                    short-term credits for the purchase of agricultural raw
                                    materials; action on the $60 million cotton credit (short-term)
                                    request is anticipated shortly;</p>
                                <p>“5. the Japanese should give greater attention to removing
                                    obstacles to the entry of private foreign capital; the U.S. is
                                    concerned that Japan appears to be deliberately discouraging the
                                    entry of American capital into equity investment;</p>
                                <p>“6. the U.S. does not, as a general matter, comment on the
                                    economic soundness of foreign flotations on the American market;
                                    the prospective borrower, however, must comply with the relevant
                                    Federal and local regulations.” (<gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> files, lot 55 D 388, “Japan”)</p>

                        <p>2. Fair trade practices. Embassy has observed increasing tendency toward
                            restrictive trade practices including collusive bidding, dual pricing,
                            division of markets, government designation of exclusive importers and
                            trade arrangements at artificially pegged prices. Recently, following
                            continued low level exports and heavy import balance, government has
                            considered legislative and administrative measures involving official
                            production controls over certain industries, preferential treatment in
                            foreign exchange allocations and extension of indirect and direct
                            subsidies. Seeking bureaucratic controls, <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> officials, supported by some political leaders and big
                            business, continue active campaign for more drastic amendment or repeal
                            anti-monopoly and export trading laws.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Should Japan openly engage in
                            preferential allocation of exchange to importers or markets to
                            exporters, Embassy believes action would be adverse to Japanese best
                            interest as well as American. Dual pricing will stimulate defensive
                            action by other nations to restrict Japanese trade. Japan, however,
                            almost certain encourage certain degree reconcentration industrial and
                            trading firms because of historic pattern and paucity of resources and
                            capable business leaders. Competition is uncongenial concept. Therefore
                            rather than opposing reconcentration per se Embassy suggests
                            representation against those restrictive practices which obviously are
                            detrimental to Japanese economy and American trade.</p>

                        <p>1. Japanese prepared discuss defense plans ranging somewhere between
                                <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> and Ministry Finance plans.
                            Except possibly for Navy plan falls short US goals but after
                            negotiations may provide basis understanding on US military assistance.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will probably take
                            position to be acceptable to Japanese Diet and people plan would have to
                            be solidly based on understanding re planned withdrawal US ground
                            forces. If attempt made to present defense plan of this order without
                            understanding on both US assistance and reduction US ground forces,
                            Government would fall with probable strengthening left Socialists.

                            discredited.</p>
                        <p>US forces expected to be in Japan over balance this fiscal year 2 1/3 to
                            3 1/3 divisions. Existing US plans call for increasing to four divisions
                            when forces can be taken from Korea. This not generally known to
                            Japanese and would most seriously disturb. Under existing US thinking
                            commencement reduction US forces below four divisions would be
                            considered at earliest only when Japanese ground forces reached about
                            200,000 which is most Japanese now prepared discuss as five year
                            goal.</p>
                        <p>Main problem for US therefore whether prepared plan reduce present forces
                            progressively as Japanese develop ground force of 180–200,000.
                            Alternative such US undertaking could be Japanese refusal adopt new
                            defense plans, increase anti-Americanism and increase political strength
                            parties opposed cooperation with US. Would it be in our interest in
                            promoting Japanese defense buildup to state frankly Japanese will have
                            to raise sights considerably to afford basis US withdrawal?</p>
                        <p>Appreciate foregoing may be too categorically stated. Do you see basis
                            reconciling Japanese plans with US concept requisite forces in

                        <p>Other problems will be whether Japanese defense expenditures adequate

                                In this lengthy telegram the Embassy argued strongly against the
                                recent decision of the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to
                                negotiate with Japan on the basis of the German formula, partly
                                because such a straight financial settlement would be difficult to
                                distinguish from reparations and would be for a higher proportion of
                                the claim (37 1/2 percent) than any of the reparations terms the
                                United States was suggesting Japan negotiate with third countries.
                                The Embassy suggested that instead the United States start with a
                                fixed sum to be computed under some formula other than a percentage
                                of the assistance rendered, that the payments be accelerated but
                                interest-free, that the United States undertake to convert perhaps
                                half the payments into yen to be spent in Japan (Embassy’s proposal
                                D), and that most of the remaining half be used for U.S.
                                developmental loans in Japan and in Southeast Asia (Embassy’s

                            to build up a large enough military establishment, so that we could take
                            our own land forces out of Japan. He felt they would increasingly become
                            a subject of irritation in Japanese goodwill.</p>
                        <p>2. He urged a clear position on Okinawa, namely, that we were going to
                            hold it. I pointed out that, while there was no intention of giving up
                            Okinawa, there were a number of problems to be worked out in terms of
                            civilian administration and economic and monetary relation with Japan. I
                            was reluctant to see us issue a statement on Okinawa until these matters
                            had been agreed upon. I did not think that we could put Okinawa in a
                            completely closed compartment without economic and social relations with
                            neighboring islands and with acute problems on fishing, etc. Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> seemed to agree but
                            felt on the whole that we must retain the civilian administration, and
                            he doubted the practicability of using Japanese currency.</p>
                        <p>3. He asked what the terms were for our delivery of military supplies to
                            the French. Did they get title or would we retain title so that if
                            anything went wrong we could get the stuff back, not letting it fall
                            into Communist hands if some new French Government tried to pull out and
                            make a deal with Ho Chi Minh.<note n="1" xml:id="d695fn1">For

                                telegram 864, dated Oct. 5, the Embassy emphasized that the Embassy
                                as well as the Japanese had not known of the U.S. plan to increase
                                U.S. forces stationed in Japan to four divisions, prior to the
                                receipt of telegram 797. “They were told in <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kimura</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> meeting (see telegram 767 from Tokyo, <ref target="#d690">Document 690</ref>) that we thought they should
                                go to 300,000 but were not told we would in meantime nearly double
                                our forces here. Nothing definite been said as to exact relationship
                                between their build-up and our withdrawal but Japanese have always
                                assumed this would occur <hi rend="italic">pari passu.”</hi> After
                                lengthy analysis, the Embassy concluded that if this new plan was
                                firm it would be necessary to take Japan further into U.S.
                                confidence than had hitherto been the case, not just about purely
                                military matters but about U.S. Far Eastern policy in general,
                                including the problem of restraints on military initiatives by the
                                Republic of Korea. Lastly, it would be necessary to point out that
                                Japan would “raise sights considerably” on military matters, “not to
                                obtain withdrawal as suggested reference telegram, but rather to
                                deter aggression and provide security in dangerous times ahead.”

                        </p>
                        <p>Department’s message seems to me to raise many important questions and to
                            indicate that Washington agencies are thinking in terms which hitherto
                            have not been made clear to any of us in Japan, either civil or
                            military. In recent talks with General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName> and high ranking members his staff whole emphasis
                            has been on necessity of informing Japanese at earliest possible
                            opportunity of United States intention to decrease number its forces in
                            Japan and <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> staff had prepared for
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>’s consideration
                            announcement that United States would not request additional facilities
                            to those they now have and in fact would look forward to increasing
                            return of facilities to Japanese. Obviously no such statement can be
                            made in good faith if policy of increase mentioned in Department
                            telegram 797 is to be followed. Assume if United States forces doubled
                            this would mean similar increase in number of dependents. Has Department
                            considered effect this would have, not only on spread of inflation, but
                            on generally increasing points of contact and hence irritation between
                            relatively low living standard Japanese and high standard
                            dependents?</p>
                        <p>I am also concerned over fact that reference telegram apparently based on
                            assumption considerations therein can profitably be used as negotiating
                            basis with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. Rather it seems
                            to me policy of increase outlined in reference telegram means there must
                            be urgent <pb xml:id="pg_1522" n="1522" facs="0466"/>and concrete effort
                            educate <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and through him
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and other key figures
                            in Japan as to necessity for build-up of United States forces here
                            rather than decrease.</p>
                        <p>In last two months Japanese Government has made considerable strides
                            forward in its thinking and action regarding increasing its own defense
                            potentiality. Most recent indication of this is <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> announcement of agreement on defense program
                            and on necessity revising present legislation to permit national safety
                            force to become in fact “defense” force and have authority to repel
                            aggression from abroad. It is probably difficult from Washington to
                            realize what great step forward this is but to one sitting in Tokyo it
                            is extremely significant. Only two nights before announcement, at
                            farewell dinner for Clarks, <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> took me aside and spent some time detailing his
                            worry over creation military caste in Japan. He admitted necessity of
                            rearmament but pleaded for patience along same lines as did Inukai<note n="3" xml:id="d696fn3">Ken Inukai, Minister of Justice and

                        </p>
                        <p>If United States Government is convinced of necessity, from our own
                            security point of view, of carrying out program generally along lines
                            mentioned in Department telegram 797 I cannot too strongly emphasize
                            necessity of, in some manner, making crystal clear to Japanese leaders
                            reasons for this necessity. From things told me last night by
                                Bullitt<note n="5" xml:id="d696fn5">William C. Bullitt had been

                            considerable feeling in responsible quarters Washington that time is
                            running out and speed in building worldwide defense system is essential.
                            If that is so, I have not been given enough information to enable me to
                            argue persuasively with Japanese leaders to this effect, other than on
                            basis of justifiable impatience of Congress which is furnishing funds.
                            If <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> should go to United
                            States I believe he should be told most frankly what situation is and I
                            strongly recommend I be ordered home for consultation at same time in
                            order that I may have benefit of latest United States thinking in even
                            greater detail so I will be in position to back up Washington more
                            effectively. Even if <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> does
                            not go to United States I suggest such consultation would be
                            worthwhile.</p>

                        <p>In his diary notes for October 8, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> discussed Japan as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In Japan there seems to be some hope that the Japanese will attempt to
                            pick up some of the load and establish their own security organization.
                            Their Constitution, adopted under General <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthur</persName>’s supervision, denies them the right to have
                            military forces. But the time has come when they must become responsible
                            for their own internal defense, even though to avoid frightening our
                            other friends in the Pacific, we must always provide the naval and air
                            strength required in that region by the free world.” (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, Whitman file,

                                    review of his recent trip to Europe. He is then recorded as
                                    saying:</p>
                                <p>“More important than anything else is the fact that it is now
                                    clear to the Soviets by virtue of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance that if Western Europe is attacked,
                                    that means World War III. The actual forces in being, plus the
                                    U.S. strategic air force make clear that that is not a mere
                                    bluff. It is significant, I think, that the outbreak of
                                    aggressive war took place in the Far East just when the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance came into effect.
                                    Soviet power has a tendency to flow wherever there is a power
                                    vacuum and there was such a vacuum in the Far East. It had been
                                    indicated that Korea was not of strategic importance to the U.S.
                                    and Korea was weak. So the forces of aggression struck there

                            bombers with thousand-mile radius, and equivalent B–29’s). Fighters

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> referred to the
                            agreement at the last meeting that the Department of Defense would be
                            prepared to discuss its thinking on Japan’s forces in greater detail
                            than the statement made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Nash</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName> emphasized that the
                            data he was about to give did not represent a completed study on air and
                            naval forces, that they were preliminary and, as in the case of the
                            ground force, were conceived as the minimum regarded as the minimum
                            regarded as essential. The following air force is under consideration by
                            the Joint Chiefs on recommendations of the Far East Command:</p>

                        <p>Taking into account reserve and maintenance the total amount of planes
                            would be about 800 and the total personnel for such a force about
                            30,000.</p>
                        <p>The interceptor types cannot be determined until the actual time of
                            turnover is known. They would probably be F–86. The transports would
                            probably be the CI–19, so-called flying boxcar. We would expect to take
                            three or four years to build up to the nine interceptor squadrons. In
                            the current <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> a start could be made on
                            training, including two interceptor squadrons and a training school. The
                            two squadrons would have about 75 aircraft. The type would depend on the
                            availability to the Command at the time. The trainer would presumably be
                            the T–33 jet trainer. It may be that some T–34 primary trainers could be
                            included. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName> emphasized
                            that he <pb xml:id="pg_1528" n="1528" facs="0472"/>was stating planning
                            estimates and that the actual implementation would be the responsibility
                            of the field commander. For this reason it was impossible to be specific
                            about the actual assignment of the equipment as this would depend on the
                            availabilities to the field command at the time of delivery.</p>
                        <p>For Navy Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName> mentioned 18
                            frigates, 50 landing craft (both of which are already on loan) and 40
                            mine sweepers. The personnel would be about 13,500. This is not a
                            long-term program and can be handled as fast as the Japanese are ready.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said that the Japanese
                            already have 10,300 personnel. He asked for further information on
                            tonnage, crews, etc., and inquired whether any destroyers, destroyer
                            escorts were omitted, as this type had been mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFC1">Nash</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName> said that they were not included because this
                            was an immediate program, that we would be glad to hear the Japanese
                            ideas on a long-range navy program. We had not elaborated one because we
                            felt that the Japanese in time could meet their own requirements.</p>
                        <p>The ground force, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Sullivan</persName>
                            said, is in our judgment the most important because we will have large
                            air and naval forces in the area for some time. But if our current
                            forces in Korea were redeployed we would not be able to keep any large
                            ground forces available since it does not have the mobility of air and
                            naval craft.</p>
                        <p>He also commented that we would believe it desirable to have a number of
                            anti-aircraft battalions equipped with radar and anti-aircraft weapons.
                            Most of this is presently purely U.S. There had been some discussion in
                            U.S. circles of 19 anti-aircraft battalions.</p>
                        <p>Our thought on the buildup of the 10 divisions of 325,000–man ground
                            force was 6 divisions by July 1, 1954, 8 divisions by July 1, 1955 and
                            10 divisions by July 1, 1956. On organization the U.S. division
                                slice<note n="7" xml:id="d699fn7">A “slice” is an average logistics
                                planning factor used to estimate requirements for personnel and
                                materiel. It usually consists of the total strength of the basic
                                combatant element plus its share of all supporting and higher
                                headquarters personnel.</note> is 20,000 plus. We are thinking of
                            17,000 plus for the Japanese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> referred to a division slice of 32,500 as
                            resulting from figures previously mentioned on the U.S. side and said
                            that the understanding that the Japanese had reached in Tokyo was that
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces division slice ran
                            around 18,000, some as low as 12,000. The National Safety Force people
                            have reached the conclusion in their own minds that an appropriate
                            division slice for Japan would be 18,600.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that in order that these questions might be pursued further
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> would seek to
                            arrange a meeting as soon as possible with the Chairman of the Joint

                        <p>1. Last evening the group, above, met for dinner and an evening’s
                            conversation at Mr. Berger’s<note n="2" xml:id="d702fn2">Samuel D.
                                Berger, Counselor of Embassy.</note> home. The evening had been
                            arranged as an opportunity for a frank and informal exchange of ideas in
                            a non-negotiating, non-transactional atmosphere. The talk was relaxed,
                            speculative, and largely uninhibited. Ideas seemed to get through the
                            veil of official restraint and politeness that most of us encounter most
                            of the time with our Japanese counterparts. As for the Japanese side,
                            they ordered their car for 9:30 and left at 11:45. They appeared to
                            enjoy the evening and would like it repeated.</p>
                        <p>2. The following seemed the pivotal ideas expressed by the Japanese
                            officers:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. There is a tradition of, and an increasing awareness of the
                                need for, strong government in Japan. The country is too poor, beset
                                by too many problems, to afford the luxury of weakness and
                                indecision in its political direction. The logic of events thus
                                tends toward strong government. The question is whether a strong
                                government comes from the right or from the left.</item>
                            <item>b. The left in Japan can come to power, short of war, only as a
                                function of economic depression, but if a serious depression should
                                occur, the left would almost certainly win a parliamentary victory.
                                That it could hold power by parliamentary means—in the face of a
                                right counter-attack and its own weaknesses—is doubtful. How long a
                                left government in office would continue to respect constitutional
                                guarantees in this power situation is equally uncertain.</item>
                            <item>c. There are reserves of strength in Japanese conservatism which
                                at present are not fully tapped or organized but which provide at
                                least a potential solidity for the right. The Japanese left can be
                                shattered; the Japanese right probably cannot. Thus far, the concept
                                of class consciousness has not proceeded far in Japan. The awareness
                                of “being Japanese” is still far more pervasive and unifying <pb xml:id="pg_1533" n="1533" facs="0477"/>than the consciousness of
                                separate and division membership in capital or labor. Over a longer
                                run, this sense of “Japanese-ness” will work to the benefit of the
                                right.</item>
                            <item>d. The Imperial institution still provides an ultimate source of
                                allegiance and intervention. The Emperor’s influence must be
                                sparingly used, but in an extreme situation his role could again be
                                decisive. This influence is to be measured in extra-constitutional
                                terms, but it is a power factor.</item>
                            <item>e. The course of Japanese foreign policy is firmly and unshakeably
                                set for cooperation with the United States “over the next three or
                                four years.” After that, Japan will want to think things out for
                                itself.</item>
                            <item>f. American economic assistance, while making possible the
                                tremendous post-war recovery of Japan, is today a mixture of help
                                and hindrance. It has removed incentive to take the corrective
                                actions needed if Japan is to live within its own means. The U.S.
                                should accordingly reduce its dollar expenditures in Japan, but “it
                                should do so gently.”</item>
                            <item>g. U.S. policy toward Japan has fluctuated too widely. During the
                                Occupation the U.S. intervened too much. Since the Occupation, the
                                U.S. has not intervened enough. The U.S. should not hestitate to
                                attach conditions to its aid, but, in doing so, it should make it
                                clear that decision is up to Japan: “If you want x, you must do y,
                                but whether you want x is for you to decide.” Similarly, there need
                                to be more joint institutions (both official and informal). The
                                model of the Administrative Agreement’s Joint Committee is useful;
                                it should be extended to other fields—defense, information, policy.
                                At the top, liaison between the two governments is cordial and
                                close, but it should be extended to the staff levels. The working
                                levels of the Japanese Government need and would welcome greater
                                association with American officials.</item>

                            this connection and government hoped it would be able to say islands
                            would be returned on or about December 1. I told him I could give <pb xml:id="pg_1534" n="1534" facs="0478"/>him no definite information
                            in this connection, but hoped it would be possible to meet his
                            desires.</p>
                        <p>I referred to necessity of reaching agreement on military facilities to
                            be retained and I told him frankly that one of difficulties was close
                            relationship which Amami group bears to security of Okinawa and
                            necessity of devising some method of insuring that future developments
                            would not menace that security. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> appeared most understanding and said he was
                            certain Japanese Government would go to great lengths to meet American
                            desires. He asked whether or not it was possible for United States
                            military to list type of rights or facilities it might need in future
                            and said that if this could be done, he felt definite agreement could be
                            reached; that Japanese Government would at any time be willing to
                            negotiate with United States Government arrangement for such rights or
                            facilities. I said I hoped this could be done and that we were earnestly
                            looking into matter.</p>
                        <p>I believe <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> reflects true
                            cooperative attitude of Japanese Government toward this question and
                            that if we approach them on reasonable basis, we can obtain all
                            legitimate needs. However, if we demand everything in writing in first
                            instance, thereby indicating to Japanese our distrust of their good
                            will, I seriously doubt that present cooperative attitude will be
                            maintained.</p>

                            involved precise legal status and amount obligation and possibility
                            relating payments United States expenditures Japan. Amount claim to be
                            pursued further next week with object on United States side clarifying
                            discrepancy United States and Japanese figures but not reconciling
                            accounts. Will insist that as German case write-down eliminates

                            year (in terms expenditures not contracts). Suzuki argued if estimates
                            based $800 million estimate last year figures $100 million too high by
                            reason confused accounting. Point to be explored further, request
                            comments. Japanese indicated concern <pb xml:id="pg_1541" n="1541" facs="0485"/>over ability support forces when built, lack United

                        <p>3. In place of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> proposal for special arrangements in
                            the Amami group outside of the Security Treaty and Administrative
                            Agreement, <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> has proposed to Defense an
                            enclosure to the exchange of notes which would provide for the
                            application of the Security Treaty and Administrative Agreement to the
                            Amami group but at the same time establish Japanese recognition of the
                            unique strategic relationship existing between the Amami group and
                            Okinawa. Within this framework <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>
                            proposes to spell out in unpublished minutes certain of those special
                            rights in the Amami group desired by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> which are believed to be politically negotiable and
                            which are not considered to be clearly stated in the Administrative
                            Agreement. Such minutes would cover United States access to air space
                            and territorial waters, permission to conduct site surveys and to remove
                            devices interfering with the United States radar system, and the
                            interchange of radar positions. The effectiveness <pb xml:id="pg_1544" n="1544" facs="0488"/>and protection of the United States radar
                            system in the Amami group is the primary concern of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. A second enclosure would provide for
                            our retention of the facilities we now hold and any additional
                            facilities the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> think we may need in
                            the future.</p>
                        <p>4. Defense liked our proposal and is submitting it to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Our proposal has met with the approval of the Embassy. The Ambassador

                            strategic problem involved and will go to great lengths to meet
                            legitimate United States needs so long as an unbearable political

                                (033.9411/10–2753)</note> I think we have pushed Japanese as hard as
                            is wise and what is required now is a respite to Jet them digest
                            significance of our views.<note n="3" xml:id="d710fn3">In paragraph 9 of
                                telegram 1088 <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> also
                                stated: “As Department is aware this is first time Japan told

                                mentioned learning from <persName corresp="#p_IY1">Izeki</persName>
                                the latter’s conviction that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> probably would not visit Washington because
                                a conservative political coalition had not yet been formed and
                                because “<persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> talks proved
                                more than exploratory and produced definite US position which
                                involves little or no political kudos for Prime Minister.”</note>
                            From over-all point of view our objectives and US-Japanese relations
                            wind-up communiqué should indicate: (a) Exchange of views was
                            profitable; (b) no agreements <pb xml:id="pg_1545" n="1545" facs="0489"/>reached; and (c) intention resuming discussions at an early date.
                            Important (b) be included since <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> will be charged with entering secret
                            understandings and will need this. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> in appearance before Diet Foreign Affairs
                            Committee yesterday has already started putting out line that
                            negotiations were only exploratory by denying that <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> has submitted any rearmament
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>2. On ground-force build-up our order of preference is 1, 4, 3, 2 (your
                            1009, last paragraph). For reasons in paragraph 1, I believe it should
                            be omitted entirely from any understanding or communiqué. Japanese ready
                            to go ahead and preference 4 or 3 will only commit us to a ceiling and
                            either tie our hands or put on us onus of once again pushing Japanese do
                            what they themselves should do in own interest. There is nothing to be
                            gained by committing ourselves now rather than a month or two months
                            hence to preference 4 or 3. There is nothing to be said in my opinion
                            for preference 2. We may at some point have to agree for time being to
                            180,000 but if so it would be preferable to have this come up from the
                            Japanese side in the course of the next few weeks or months than as a
                            result of what will be interpreted as American pressure on <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> in Washington. Believe actually
                            pressures in Japan to settle problem on nation’s future security likely
                            increase and conservative elements who now know what we want and why
                            will become increasingly uneasy at lack of agreement on force goals.</p>
                        <p>3. Regarding <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss>. I think it is
                            impossible to get a settlement by the end of the year, and <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> is right in saying the Diet would
                            repudiate it. Government in next two months will have to deal with
                            consequences of rice crop failure.<note n="4" xml:id="d710fn4">In
                                telegram 1099, Oct. 28, the Ambassador reported on an estimated
                                decline of two million tons in the current rice crop. “This will
                                have adverse effect on national income, agricultural purchasing
                                power, and balance of payments position.” (033.9411/10–2853)</note>
                            It would be suicidal for government to agree pay us at time it was
                            resisting powerful Diet and public pressure to increase appropriations
                            for farmers’ relief.</p>
                        <p>4. Department knows my views on difficulties under any circumstances of
                            getting <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement, especially
                            one on straight financial lines. However, I think Department should not
                            let this occasion pass without some definite indication of our serious
                            intention not to let matter drag out any longer. I therefore suggest
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> be told that we expect
                            government will make provision in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954
                            budget either for fixed amount or blank amount. Budget now in
                            intermediate stage of drafting contains provision only for reparations.
                            If we get at least this put before Diet it will be gain in sense that it
                            will be a recognition that <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> is
                            now on agenda. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> might also be
                            told that we will present a note later asking <pb xml:id="pg_1546" n="1546" facs="0490"/>for time to be fixed for negotiations.
                            However, while as stated Embassy telegram 614<note n="5" xml:id="d710fn5">
                                <ref target="#d684">Document 684</ref>.</note>
                            <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> requires urgent settlement as
                            matter of major importance which could lead to serious repercussions if
                            not settled soon, nevertheless if we have to choose between <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> and force goals obviously latter
                            of more importance to fundamental US objectives.</p>
                        <p>5. One reason for proposals in this telegram is that next two months will
                            be crucial time for conservative forces and coalition maneuvers. It is
                            desirable that coalition maneuvers should take place at same time as our
                            views are being digested here.</p>

                            dated 9 October 1953,<note n="1" xml:id="d711fn1">Not printed. (Attached
                                to the source text)</note> referred to recent developments in
                            connection with the fisheries dispute between Japan and Korea, and to
                            actions by the Republic of Korea which have worked to the disadvantage
                            and embarrassment of the United States Government and the
                            Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command.</p>
                        <p>There are several specific points made in the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            memorandum, a copy of which has previously been made available to your
                            staff and an additional copy which is inclosed for your information.
                            Specifically, the Joint Chiefs of Staff point out that the action of the
                            Republic of Korea in re-establishing the so-called <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line and the seizure of Japanese
                            vessels constitutes a challenge to the authority and responsibility of
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> which, if not
                            effectively countered, might undermine the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Command
                            relationship. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also point out that no public
                            announcement of the United States position, which regards the <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line as contrary to international
                            law, has ever been made. An additional point of considerable
                            significance is the dangerous precedent which the <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line might set and encourage other
                            countries in the area, such as Communist China, to undertake against
                            Japanese fishing vessels on the high seas.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1547" n="1547" facs="0491"/>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff point out in their memorandum that it is their
                            belief, which is shared by General <persName corresp="#p_CGMW1">Clark</persName>, that further concessions to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would not achieve the desired
                            results of reaching an accord on matters in which there is a difference
                            of view between the United States Government and the Republic of Korea.
                            They further point out that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s attitude has had a deleterious effect upon the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Command relationship and tends to compromise the future
                            responsiveness of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>’s orders and detracts from the
                            prestige of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander. They
                            mentioned further that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s attitude has embarrassed United States
                            representatives in the field other than the military, referring to a
                            message dated 19 September 1953 from Ambassador Briggs.<note n="2" xml:id="d711fn2">Telegram 237 from Seoul, not printed. (Attached to

                            refer to a joint message, dated 26 September 1953, from Ambassador
                            Briggs, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>, and

                            to embarrass the United States Government and the United Nations

                                    watching US-Korean relations. If <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> appears to be gaining his ends by continued

                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that further measures should be taken
                            in dealing with the fisheries problem in the context of an overall
                            approach by the United States Government to bring about a more
                            reasonable and cooperative attitude on the part of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government with respect to all prevailing problems
                            which are of mutual concern to the Republic of Korea, the United States,
                            and to the United Nations Command. Specifically, the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff recommend that all possible pressures be brought to bear on the
                            Japanese and Korean Governments to arrive at an agreement in their
                            disputed fishing rights and, if these pressures are not successful, that
                            the United States withdraw logistic support for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Navy. They recommended also that the
                            United States consider other measures which might be taken, including
                            the withholding of economic aid and other benefits.</p>
                        <p>I fully appreciate the sensitivity of the problem of dealing with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. I further
                            appreciate that the Department of State <pb xml:id="pg_1548" n="1548" facs="0492"/>would not wish to force a show-down which could result
                            in a breakdown in the relationships between the United States Government
                            and the Republic of Korea and thereby possibly provide President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> with a basis to abrogate
                            his agreement with respect to the Armistice Agreement. However, it is my
                            view that permitting President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to continue to act unilaterally to the military and
                            political disadvantage of the United States places this Government in an
                            untenable position. Further, unless it is made absolutely clear to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> that we will not
                            permit these conditions to continue, his actions will grow bolder and he
                            will not hesitate to take more drastic actions which could lead to a
                            dangerous situation with respect to the interests of the United States
                            Government and to the security of the United States forces in Korea.
                            Therefore, I strongly recommend that the Department of State give
                            favorable consideration to the Joint Chiefs of Staff memorandum and to
                            the course of action outlined therein.</p>

                                Negotiations</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> wanted to make sure
                            that the Secretary concurred in the proposed arrangement on <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> which was being worked out in the
                            talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. The
                            intention is to incorporate in the communiqué which will be issued after
                            the talks a statement to the effect that a settlement of the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> claims has been put off to a
                            future meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            noted the difficulties which any settlement now would place on Japan.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> nad stressed that it
                            would be particularly unfortunate at this time to agree to any payment,
                            since other countries were clamoring for reparations settlements.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1549" n="1549" facs="0493"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he concurred. It was important to keep open the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> claims since they might come in
                            handy in the future as a means of perhaps obtaining from the Japanese
                            certain United States objectives. He told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> that he had originally
                            inserted payment of these claims into the treaty with Japan not only in
                            an effort to recoup some of the United States outlay, but also to
                            protect Japan. At such time as other countries might clamor for
                            reparations payments, we could always chime in and say that nothing
                            could be paid them until Japan had reached a settlement with us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            to inquire if the German settlement had been made on the basis of a firm
                            figure. This was important because the bookkeeping on the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> funds had been very fuzzy and
                            sloppy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recounted to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> a conversation he had had yesterday with a
                            Japanese representative of the American Federation of Labor, during the
                            course of which the Japanese had warned him of Communist infiltration in
                                Japan.<note n="2" xml:id="d712fn2">Perhaps a reference to the
                                Secretary’s conversation held on Oct. 29 with Richard Deverall, an
                                American who had been Asian Representative, stationed in Japan, of
                                the Free Trade Union Committee of the American Federation of
                                Labor.</note> Two points he made, which the Secretary suggested Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> look into, were the
                            conditions around the Army camps and the dressing of Japanese Security
                            Reserve Forces in American uniforms. Both of these were having a
                            deleterious effect on United States–Japanese relations.</p>

                        <p>Upon conclusion of the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> talks
                            on October 30, the two sides issued the following joint statement:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Hayato Ikeda</persName>, the personal
                            representative of the Prime Minister of Japan, and his party had a
                            series of conferences with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter S.
                                Robertson</persName>, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern
                            Affairs, and other officials of the United States Government during the
                            past four weeks.</p>
                        <p>“The talks covered various interrelated problems of mutual interest such
                            as Japan’s defense build-up, United States assistance, settlement for
                            United States postwar economic aid (<gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss>), foreign investment, and trade with Communist
                            China. The informal exchange of views on these subjects was most
                            profitable and lays the ground work for further cooperation between the
                            two countries.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1550" n="1550" facs="0494"/>
                        <p>The discussions were exploratory and no agreements were entered into.
                            Certain general understandings are set forth below.</p>
                        <p>“The conferees agreed on the necessity of increasing Japan’s self-defense
                            forces in order to protect her from possible aggression, and to reduce
                            the United States burden related to the defense of Japan. It was
                            however, noted that under present circumstances there are
                            constitutional, economic, budgetary and other limitations which will not
                            allow the immediate building of Japan’s self-defense forces to a point
                            sufficient for Japan’s defense. With due regard to these limitations,
                            continued effort on the part of Japan will be made to expedite the
                            build-up. Subject to necessary or items of military equipment for the
                            land, sea and air forces which Japan raises.</p>
                        <p>“Questions relating to Japanese defense forces and United States military
                            assistance will be discussed further in Tokyo in the near future by
                            representatives of the two governments with a view to reaching a
                            definite understanding.</p>
                        <p>“The conferees agreed that a reduction in Japan’s contribution to the
                            support of United States forces should be considered from time to time
                            in the light of the development of Japan’s own forces. It was also
                            agreed that the withdrawal of the United States forces from Japan would
                            be effected as the Japanese forces develop the capability to defend
                            their country.</p>
                        <p>“The conferees considered that $50 million is a reasonable target amount
                            for commodities to be supplied to Japan under Section 550 of the Mutual
                            Security Act. It is contemplated that the local currency proceeds of the
                            sale of such agricultural products will be used to help develop the
                            defense production and the industrial potential of Japan through
                            offshore procurement and investment. Necessary arrangements will be
                            executed to cover the requirements of Section 550 and the related
                            defense support activities.</p>
                        <p>“The conferees recognized that pending a political settlement in Korea it
                            is important to maintain a high level of controls over trade with
                            Communist China. However, the implications of these controls for
                            Japanese trade are such that the United States and Japan will continue
                            current consultations on the items to be controlled.</p>
                        <p>“The United States conferees attached great importance to an early
                            settlement for <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> aid. It was
                            agreed to hold a meeting in Tokyo in the near future between
                            representatives of the United States and Japan with a view to reaching
                            an agreement on the settlement.</p>
                        <p>“As to foreign investment in Japan, the investment guaranty program under
                            the Mutual Security Act and the Contact Clearing House Service, as well
                            as the services of the United States Department of Commerce, were
                            suggested as helpful measures to be taken on the side of the United
                            States, while willingness on the part of Japan to liberalize Japanese
                            laws and regulations pertaining to foreign investments was expressed by
                            the Japanese conferees in order to create a better climate for foreign
                            investment.</p>
                        <p>“The Japanese conferees expressed their belief that vigorous efforts on
                            the part of Japan to resist inflation are most important in order to
                            strengthen Japan’s economic position and to promote further economic
                            cooperation between the United States and Japan.</p>

                        <p>“It was gratifying for all the conferees to learn that while they were in
                            conference the $40 million loans for Japanese thermal electric projects
                            were signed by the International Bank and Japanese representatives, and
                            that the $60 million cotton credit to Japan was announced by the
                            Export-Import Bank of Washington.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, November 9, 1953, page 637)</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Foreign Office on August 15 issued the second installment of
                            a series of papers entitled “The World and Japan”—a series which appears
                            to be having some influence in enlightening public opinion on the base
                            issue and which has been helpful in stemming the tide of the anti-base
                            and anti-American movement of May and June. This paper, which was widely
                            distributed, analyzes in detail the problem of Japanese opposition to
                            United States facilities and areas and is an effective answer to charges
                            that Japan is becoming a huge military base. It is optimistic with
                            regard to the alleviation of major causes of opposition (economic loss
                            from use of land and fishing areas; bad effects on education and morals;
                            airplane noise) and, in connection with politically motivated
                            opposition, explains the need for collective security and the attempts
                            of leftists to drive a wedge between the United States and Japan. It
                            also makes the following points: Contrary to exaggerated leftist
                            charges, the 719 facilities and areas now used by United States forces
                            (as compared to 2,152 at the time the Peace Treaty came into force)
                            comprise only .0038 of the total area of Japan, and in many of these
                            areas interference with local activities is minimal. The Joint Committee
                            has worked out plans for relocation of United States forces in cities
                            subject to new construction in Tokyo and Yokohama at Japan’s expense.
                            Local Liaison Councils are being set up in locations throughout Japan
                            and provide a forum for discussion on all problems of joint concern.
                            (The Embassy recognizes that there is a fair amount of whitewashing in
                            the paper the local Liaison Councils have not yet accomplished much; the
                            Joint Committee has not actually solved the problem of relocating United
                            States forces from large cities and it seems optimistic to expect that
                            Japan will spend large sums to build new facilities within Tokyo to
                            enable the release of a few conspicuous buildings.)</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office expresses the view that United States forces have now
                            reached the stage where no new requests for large areas will be made.
                            This is probably the crucial issue in the base problem.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1553" n="1553" facs="0497"/>
                        <p>There will be strong opposition to any attempt by United States forces to
                            expand existing facilities and in fact Japanese public opinion can be
                            expected to become increasingly restive if United States forces do not
                            constrict their operations in Japan. Japanese leaders now talk publicly
                            and with apparent confidence about the withdrawal of United States
                            forces as a probability within the next few years and the Japanese
                            people are likely to expect early signs that this withdrawal policy is
                            being put into effect.</p>
                        <p>The anti-base movement has noticeably declined since the end of June, one
                            reason being that the Japanese Government and the United States forces
                            did not press for immediate use of any of the hotly disputed areas such
                            as Myogi and Uchinada, where the Foreign Office hopes satisfactory
                            arrangements can soon be made. In both places the local people have been
                            weeding out leftists and outside agitators, which has also enhanced the
                            chances for settlement.</p>

                        <p>At the National Security Council meeting held November 5, the Council
                            discussed United States policy toward the People’s Republic of China,
                            including the question of trade. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> represented the Department of
                            State, and spoke briefly on the issue of trade between Japan and China.
                            According to the memorandum of this discussion, he asserted that the
                            United States had ultimately to contemplate a considerable revival of
                            this trade unless it was prepared to pay for the support of Japan’s
                            economy and the maintenance of its military defense. For an extract from

                        <p rend="flushleft">Secret</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary: I have received your letter of October 30, 1953,
                            informing me of your concern over the general trend of our <pb xml:id="pg_1554" n="1554" facs="0498"/>relations with the Republic
                            of Korea. You refer particularly to the action of the Republic of Korea
                            in re-establishing the so-called “<persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> (fisheries) line” and the seizure of Japanese
                            fishing vessels which you state is regarded as a challenge to the
                            authority and responsibility of <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>, and which, if not checked, might undermine the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> command relationship. The Department of State, too, has
                            been deeply concerned with these questions and has given careful study
                            to your letter and to the memorandum from the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            which you enclosed.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, I believe that our relations with the Republic of Korea
                            have been improving. As late as mid-June, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> was refusing to go along with the
                            armistice on any basis despite the fact that he had been offered
                            economic aid, the strengthening and maintaining of his military forces,
                            and a mutual defense pact. Since President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s letter of June 6,<note n="2" xml:id="d717fn2">This letter contains an offer of a mutual defense
                                treaty in return for South Korean acceptance of an armistice; for

                            United States concessions have been made to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> except (1) my promise to go to
                            Korea <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the signing of the armistice to
                            consult him about plans for the political conference and to negotiate
                            the defense pact, and (2) our agreement to walk out of the political
                            conference after ninety days if we consider the conference to be a sham.
                            In the meantime, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            has receded from positions repeatedly proclaimed to the Korean people
                            and the world as unalterable, the armistice has been signed, prisoners
                            of war desiring repatriation have been exchanged, and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> has fulfilled to date his
                            commitment not to obstruct the armistice. This commitment was given
                            despite his failure to obtain assurances demanded of the United States
                            which he considered basic and at a time when he had the greatest ability
                            by unilateral action to disrupt the armistice negotiations and involve
                            us in continued and possibly wider hostilities.</p>
                        <p>There are many outstanding problems with the Republic of Korea—as there
                            are with the United Kingdom, France, Japan and various other countries.
                            However, in none of these instances do we consider the situation to be
                            such that all problems can be packaged for settlement on an all-or-none
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>It is in light of the situation summarized above that the Department of
                            State has considered the specific problem of the fisheries dispute
                            between Japan and the Republic of Korea. I hope that we can find a
                            solution to this problem without resorting to the measures suggested by
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and we are currently endeavoring to do
                            so.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1555" n="1555" facs="0499"/>
                        <p>Current indications from our Embassies in Tokyo and Seoul are that both
                            the Republic of Korea and the Japanese Government desire to find a
                            peaceful solution to their problems including the fisheries dispute.
                            Both Governments have urged the United States to provide observers to be
                            present to offer practicable assistance during their negotiations which
                            are expected to be resumed in the near future. The Department of State
                            has accordingly agreed to provide United States observers if
                            negotiations are resumed in an atmosphere which holds some promise of a
                            satisfactory outcome. Both Governments have agreed to the designation as
                            observers of our Counselor of Embassy in Seoul, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BNW1">Niles W. Bond</persName>, and the Special
                            Assistant for Fisheries and Wildlife to the Under Secretary, Mr. William
                            C. Herrington. It is hoped that participation of the American observers
                            will result in a more conciliatory attitude on the part of both
                            Governments and establish the basis for a satisfactory settlement.</p>
                        <p>I believe, therefore, that the approach we are currently making should be
                            given time and opportunity to succeed before considering other
                            measures.</p>

                        <p>1415. I recommend following US position for Tokyo negotiations on Japan’s
                            defense program. General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>
                            concurs.</p>
                        <p>1. Talks with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> Washington and
                            here and discussions with <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> officials
                            suggest Japanese presently plan propose at resumed talks (a) ground
                            force of 180,000 by April 1957 with increase of 30,000 (including 10,000

                            in five years with 150 light planes as starter next year (Japanese plan
                            tentatively includes army aviation types), and (d) <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> budget of 144–149 billions in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1954 compared with current years 123.4
                            billions. 144–149 figure in (d) will break down into 87–92 billions for
                            Japanese defense forces compared with present appropriation of 61.4
                            billions of which 5 billions to be obtained by reduction in contribution
                            to US forces from 62 to 57 billions.</p>
                        <p>2. Japanese position formulated with full knowledge Washington views and
                            apparent understanding probable extent US assistance available. It is
                            unlikely Japanese can be persuaded deviate substantially from foregoing
                            program.</p>
                        <p>3. In secret talk with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>
                            November 27, he told me Japanese program which he did not reveal, now
                            fairly firm and under consideration by Finance Ministry in anticipation
                            budget decisions about December 25. He said it would be held close and
                            expressed concern lest it be substantially less than US absolute minimum
                            in which case long negotiation would be necessary.</p>
                        <p>4. In my view long delay in arriving at US minimum position for long
                            negotiation should be avoided because the respective US-Japanese
                            program, real or fancied, would be bandied about in press and Diet;
                            propensity to support lower figure would be built up in public <pb xml:id="pg_1557" n="1557" facs="0501"/>mind; whatever was eventually
                            agreed on would inevitably give rise to charges of American pressures;
                            Government would again be under attack for secret diplomacy and
                            subservience US; and next forward step would start out under cloud
                            because program adopted would appear to be US rather than Japanese
                            product. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> himself foresaw
                            this possible sequence of events and stressed importance from standpoint
                            of interests both countries that we must find some way to avoid it.</p>
                        <p>5. Because of these considerations I promised <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> I would try to supply in not more than two weeks
                            time those initial yearly increases in forces which the US considers the
                            minimum required as effective steps toward reasonable force goals for
                            Japan. In return he promised not to let Japanese position be frozen in
                            meantime.</p>
                        <p>6. In view long talks with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> in
                            Washington, no useful purpose would be served in going over same ground.
                            We should now put in figures which may not satisfy us but represent the
                            most, especially on ground forces and budget, that Government and
                            conservative forces in this country can attempt. In formulating our
                            position we compelled face Japanese realities, particularly
                            constitutional problem, unreadiness of large part of public opinion, and
                            vulnerability of conservative forces to leftist attack if build-up too
                            rapid, at this time. Moreover, we cannot ignore widespread fear here,
                            shared by <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> himself, of
                            return of military clique if build-up too rapid, and impact on budget of
                            irresistible demands for relief from this year’s great flood damage and
                            crop failure which will require heavy expenditures next fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>7. While we should maintain that US considers ground force of at least
                            300,000 is minimum adequate for Japan’s defense, do not think It
                            desirable or practicable seek present commitment to this figure. Any
                            insistence on commitment this time that Japan should have ground force
                            this size would not only fly in face of Japanese realities outlined
                            paragraph 6 above but would obstruct maturing efforts towards
                            conservative cooperation and unification. With <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> agreement on defense and return <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> and most of his followers to
                            Liberal Party real progress has been made in this direction. Efforts to
                            win over progressives to unified party of all conservative forces
                            expected to bear fruit early spring. This obviously in US interest for
                            it would provide firmly based government that could then move forward
                            more swiftly on all fronts including adoption realistic defense
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>8. Reason I am certain such commitment would block this most desirable
                            development and that Japanese Government would never agree now to US
                            ground force goal is that public opinion would be alarmed by such figure
                            and enable left opposition to capitalize on public fears. Government as
                            well as opposition conservatives, whom <pb xml:id="pg_1558" n="1558" facs="0502"/>Liberal Party now wooing, would regard such commitment
                            as serious political liability which might well tip the scales against
                            conservatives should there be early election. It would be unfortunate if
                            we obtained such a commitment only to have a united conservative party
                            publicly repudiate it for electoral reasons. Finally, if we obtained
                            secret commitment, we must bear in mind secrets are not kept in Tokyo
                            and secret agreement would not be binding on any new government. For all
                            these reasons I believe we should at this time concentrate on immediate
                            objective of getting initial build-up started at once. Japanese are
                            finding first steps hardest; once they are taken road will become
                            easier.</p>
                        <p>9. In view these considerations which I put to General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>, he and I agree we should take

                                Japan appears prepared spend between 23.9 and 27.7 billions in
                                    <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 54 on air and navy. Because
                                we think political opposition to more rapid ground force build-up
                                may limit what we can get in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 54
                                to maximum of 30,000 men, we think we should press for higher
                                sea-air budget of at least 30 billion yen. To implement sea and air
                                program in paragraph 9B and C would require exact determination of
                                costs and of sharing of these costs as agreed between US and Japan.
                                Embassy hopes proposed Japanese appropriation of 30 billion plus
                                drawing on reserve of 15 billion (see 10C below) as necessary will
                                be adequate to finance Japan’s share of costs.</item>
                            <item>C. We should also seek to commit Japanese to 15 billions to
                                finance any increment ground force over 30,000 men, to constitute
                                obligational authority for wide range of necessary supporting
                                facilities, and as reserve on which we can call to finance projects
                                we will try to persuade them to undertake during course <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 54.</item>

                                to foregoing (48 billions for ground, 30 for sea-air, and 15 for
                                reserve) would give total defense budget of 155 billions or 31.6

                            on a message No. 1415, dated 7 December 1953, from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> in Tokyo to the Department of
                            State on this subject.</p>
                        <p>3. With regard to Japanese force levels, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            believe that the revised force goals for the Japanese National Safety
                            Agency (<gloss target="#t_JNSA1">JNSA</gloss>), as enumerated in the
                            Appendix hereto, represent the minimum forces necessary for the adequate
                            defense of Japan when U.S. forces have been withdrawn. The revised force
                            goals recommended herein should supersede the previous Japanese force
                            levels indicated in the memorandum for the Secretary of Defense dated 13
                            December 1951,<note n="3" xml:id="d720fn3">The correct date is Dec. 12,

                            Defense Forces”.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>, with the
                            concurrence of the Commander in Chief, Far East, (<gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>), has recommended a U.S. position
                            for negotiations on the build-up of Japanese forces. Based on
                            discussions with Japanese officials, it is the Ambassador’s view that
                            the Japanese are likely to agree to an early build-up of their defense
                            forces, but they are unlikely to deviate substantially from the 5year
                            program previously proposed by them in Washington, i.e., a <pb xml:id="pg_1561" n="1561" facs="0505"/>ground force of 180,000, a
                            navy of 150,000 tons, and an air force of 1500 planes. The Ambassador
                            believes that these goals represent the most the Japanese Government can
                            attempt at this time. Therefore, he considers the immediate objective in
                            negotiations should be to obtain agreement on a reasonable build-up of
                            forces at once, with the understanding that the schedules proposed
                            represent a minimum phasing and will not reduce the ultimate
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>5. Although the Ambassador has proposed as a negotiating position a
                            ground force of 210,000 by April 1956, he has submitted an alternative
                            proposal which he considers politically more palatable, i.e., a ground
                            force of 180,000 (excluding civilians) by April 1956 in exchange for
                            certain commitments on the part of the Japanese Government. Acceptance
                            of this alternative proposal would permit the Ambassador to press for a
                            higher budget for naval and air forces thereby emphasizing the build-up
                            of these forces and tending toward a more balanced force structure.</p>
                        <p>6. Although the Japanese have been informed that the U.S. is willing to
                            consider supplying destroyers and destroyer escorts on a loan basis, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that it would be to the best
                            interests of both the United States and Japan, if Japan, with
                            appropriate financial assistance, constructed the majority of the ships
                            for the Coastal Safety Force. However, in order that the Japanese will
                            have sufficient experience and training to operate naval units
                            effectively, the U.S. is willing to provide on a loan basis, the
                            following ships, to be programmed during the first year of military
                            assistance (estimated <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 54):</p>
                        <p>2 Destroyers (1600 Ton type)</p>
                        <p>2 Destroyer Escorts (<gloss target="#t_DE1">DE</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>1 Submarine (<gloss target="#t_SS2">SS</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>2 Minesweepers (<gloss target="#t_AMS1">AMS</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>1 Minesweeping Craft (<gloss target="#t_MSB1">MSB</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>in addition, naval air squadrons (Patrol or <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> attack aircraft) will be provided, with one squadron
                            programmed in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 54.</p>
                        <p>7. In the air force build-up proposed by the Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>, the number of training aircraft
                            is far in excess of that previously recommended to <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> by the Commander, Far East Air
                            Forces (<gloss target="#t_COMFEAF1">COMFEAF</gloss>), but there is no
                            provision for combat aircraft during <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>
                            1954. A message from <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> has
                            indicated a requirement which makes it essential that combat aircraft be
                            introduced into the program at the earliest practicable stage in the
                            development of the Japanese air force. To achieve the most effective
                            defense program within budget limitations, <gloss target="#t_COMFEAF1">COMFEAF</gloss>’s recommendations should be used as a guide in
                            resumed negotiations.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1562" n="1562" facs="0506"/>
                        <p>8. The Joint Chiefs of Staff realize that the negotiating position
                            proposed by the Ambassador is only a basis upon which to resume
                            negotiations with a view toward getting a build-up started as soon as
                            possible. Further appraisal of the over-all program will be made as the
                            negotiations proceed and upon receipt of detailed information concerning
                            the proposed build-up schedule covering the entire 5–year period.</p>
                        <p>9. As to the estimated schedules referred to in subparagraph 1 c above
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not consider it possible to predict the
                            schedule of build-up, at this time, to which the Japanese Government
                            might be expected to agree.</p>
                        <p>10. With regard to the probable yen requirements of U.S. forces in Japan,
                            mentioned in subparagraph 1 d above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not
                            consider it possible at this time to prepare the data you have
                            requested. This data is contingent upon the phase-out of U.S. forces
                            from Japan which in turn depends upon (1) the adequate buildup of
                            Japanese forces, and, (2) the final U.S. policies and objectives which
                            may be adopted with respect to Korea affecting the deployment of U.S.
                            forces in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>11. In light of the foregoing it is recommended:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. That the revised force goals for the Japanese National Safety

                            <item>b. That, subject to the comments in paragraphs 5, 6, 7, and 8,
                                above, the Department of Defense concur with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>’s proposal for resumption

                            Japanese National Safety Force would be expanded to a balanced
                            fifteen-division ground defense force of 348,000. Divisional
                            organization will be <pb xml:id="pg_1563" n="1563" facs="0507"/>of a
                            reduced type U.S. Army infantry division of 12,022 men each. The Plan
                            also includes a Reserve Force, a Labor Service Corps, and provisions for
                            a Civil Defense Organization. It does not substantially increase the
                            requirements for personnel or major items of equipment over the
                            presently approved 10–division plan.</p>

                                    <item>The formation of an initial reserve of civilian component
                                        type combat and service units will add flexibility to
                                        emergency mobilization plans. Reserve combat units and guard
                                        units could augment the active force and assume the
                                        responsibility of internal security. The formation of these
                                        reserve units decreases the requirements for many types of
                                        active units which would otherwise be on a “standby” status.
                                        The reserve will include Combat Prefectural Guard units and
                                        a mobilization reserve to supplement the active and reserve
                                        forces in event of a general emergency.</item>

                            undertake negotiations with the Japanese with respect to the

                                pertaining to pending civil court actions in Article V of the main

                            I propose be approved to effect the transfer. In the course of the
                            negotiations it was agreed that: (a) the transfer arrangements should be
                            expressed in a formal agreement with official minutes rather than an
                            exchange of notes; (b) the United States would pardon the three
                            prisoners convicted by <gloss target="#t_USCAR1">USCAR</gloss> courts
                            who remain in Okinawa, thereby making unnecessary the assumption by
                            Japan of an obligation to carry out the sentences; (c) the transfer to
                            Japan of specified accounts owing to relief and reconstruction agencies
                            in the Ryukyus should be made without provision that collections from
                            the accounts be made available to <gloss target="#t_USCAR1">USCAR</gloss>; (d) Japan assume full responsibility to replace “B”
                            yen now circulating in the Amamis with Japanese yen without obligation
                            by the United States to reimburse Japan; and (e) the statement
                            concerning our intentions with respect to the other islands of the
                            Ryukyus be made as a unilateral declaration by the United States rather
                            than as part of a United States–Japanese exchange of notes. In other
                            respects, the agreement achieved by the negotiators is in substance the
                            same as that which you approved as the basis for the negotiations.</p>

                            December 24 and become effective December 25. They are calling a special
                            Diet session on December 24 to approve the agreement. In an effort to
                            meet this deadline, clearances of the agreement are being sought in
                            Defense and Treasury simultaneously with our clearance. We informed the

                            <item>(c) Noted that your budget estimate re ground force <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>54 lower than Japanese estimate. As
                                we understand initial cost of 1 million yen per man full amount this
                                cost incurred even if man inducted last day of year. If Japanese
                                figures correct 30,000 man increment would therefore cost 30 billion
                                not 15. Our interpretation that maintenance costs new forces would
                                be additional. Assuming even phasing 30,000 new men, this would add
                                about 5 billion yen more. <pb xml:id="pg_1567" n="1567" facs="0511"/>Therefore your cost estimate appears approximately 20 billion yen
                                below Japanese estimate for equivalent forces.</item>

                                should be examined from standpoint expenditures as distinguished
                                appropriations since we are interested results and actual impact on
                                economy. In view probable carry over expenditures may be somewhat
                                higher than appropriation and this approach may assist Congressional
                                justifications. We told <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>
                                budgetary contribution of about 200 billion yen would be necessary
                                for justification aid to U.S. Congress. Our thought was could
                                probably accept 180 billion expenditure for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>54 if other elements defense arrangements generally

                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated that he was not yet prepared to present
                            the report requested by the National Security Council on the civil
                            administration in the Ryukyu Islands, but that he would perhaps be ready
                            to give his views at the next meeting.<note n="6" xml:id="d723fn6">See

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then turned to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and asked him
                            whether he wished to go ahead with the announcement of the return of the
                            Amami group of islands. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied in <pb xml:id="pg_1569" n="1569" facs="0513"/>the affirmative, unless Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ forthcoming report on the civil
                            administration of the Ryukyus made it desirable to postpone the
                            announcement. In any case, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added, he liked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ proposed draft of the
                                announcement.<note n="7" xml:id="d723fn7">A draft text of the

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> warned the
                            members of the Council that when we announced that we were going to
                            continue for an indefinite period our control of all the Ryukyu Islands
                            except the Amami group, we could expect a very unpleasant reaction, not
                            only from Japan but in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as well.
                            While Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that
                            he was very much inclined to defer to the views of the Defense
                            Department as to the necessity, from a security point of view, of
                            retaining U.S. control of these islands, it would nevertheless make more
                            difficult relations between the United States and Japan. The effect of
                            such bad relations might go far to offset the military advantages we
                            would gain from the military rights we retained in Okinawa, for
                            instance.</p>
                        <p>The President noted the very strong feeling in Japan for the removal of
                            our forces stationed there, and wondered whether it would not be best
                            not to emphasize in the announcement our intention of holding on to all
                            the Ryukyu Islands except the Amamis indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            would like to hear the Vice President’s views on this issue, since he
                            had recently been in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President replied that he had little new to add to the Council’s
                            information. While at Okinawa he had chiefly heard the familiar military
                            viewpoint, namely, that the United States would soon have to remove its
                            forces from Japan proper, and accordingly it was vital to retain our
                            hold on Okinawa. However, the Vice President added, he found himself
                            compelled to agree with what the Secretary of State had said as to the
                            difficulties which this decision would involve us in, not only with
                            respect to Japan, but to many other parts of Asia. A major weapon of the
                            Communist campaign against us throughout Asia was the charge that we
                            supported colonialism. If we continue to stay in Okinawa we must expect
                            the Communists to agitate on this theme. Nor would the agitation be
                            confined only to the Communists. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and the Asian Nationalists would also make use of
                            it. Accordingly, said the Vice President, if we propose to persist in
                            our decision to stay in the Ryukyus, we should begin now to develop some
                            sort of face-saving legalistic <pb xml:id="pg_1570" n="1570" facs="0514"/>device, such as double citizenship, lease or something else, which
                            would sugar-coat the pill for the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that we not lose sight of the fact that the
                            Russians are in the Kuriles and lots of other places where they don’t
                            belong. We should not neglect to use this fact. It was a good
                            argument.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> stated his own
                            belief that if our military situation in the Far East deteriorates
                            seriously, it is going to be a much more difficult problem than that of
                            meeting charges of colonialism. After all, the Orient, said Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, respects
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, said the President, it seemed to him that there was very
                            little we could do to win <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>
                            over to an understanding of our position. Did the Vice President agree?
                            The Vice President answered in the affirmative, but noted the success of
                            Soviet propagandists in pinning the colonial-imperialist label on the
                            United States while avoiding it themselves.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then asked if he
                            could read to the Council the proposed text of the announcement on the
                            retention of the Ryukyus. After he had read the announcement, the
                            President inquired whether it would not be more persuasive if we would
                            stress why we have decided to remain in some of these islands, but that
                            as soon as our objectives and those of the free world have been assured,
                            we would get out.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion of the problem, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that it would be necessary
                            to issue this statement within a very few days. While this did not
                            exclude the possibility of thinking about other arrangements which could
                            be worked out in the future, it seemed, on balance, best to issue the
                            proposed announcement at once.</p>

                        <p>On December 24, representatives of Japan and the United States signed at
                            Tokyo an Agreement concerning the Amami Islands. The Agreement was
                            accompanied by an Annex, an Exchange of Notes, an Agreed Official
                            Minute, a Draft of Minutes to be adopted by the Joint Committee under
                            the Administrative Agreement, and a Record of Meeting. For texts of all
                            but the last two mentioned instruments, see 4 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> (pt. 2) 2912.</p>
                        <p>The Draft of Minutes concerned arrangements made regarding the future
                            presence of United States forces in the Amamis under the Security Treaty
                            and the Administrative Agreement. The Record of a Meeting of December
                            24, principally concerned the legal status of persons and corporate
                            persons with permanent domiciles in the Amamis, but actual residence in
                            that area of the Ryukyus which was to remain under United States
                            jurisdiction. Both the Draft of Minutes and the Record of Meeting are
                            enclosures to despatch 984 from Tokyo, December 30.

                        <p>1586. When I showed <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> advance
                            text of Secretary’s statement emphasizing United States intended to
                            retain administrative control of remainder of Ryukyus during
                            “foreseeable future”, he said grimly, “I guess it can’t be helped”. He
                            later during conversation referred to statement often attributed to
                            Quezon regarding Philippine desires for independence that it was better
                            to live in poverty and be independent than be prosperous under foreign
                            ruler. However <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> was on
                            whole philosophical on matter and recognized realities of situation.</p>
                        <p>Much of good effect of Secretary’s statement has been spoiled by United
                            Press story from Washington by-line of Steward Hensley which begins
                            “American officials Thursday said that it would be reasonably safe to
                            predict that entire chain of Ryukyu Islands <pb xml:id="pg_1572" n="1572" facs="0516"/>eventually will be returned outright to Japan
                            instead of being placed under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            trusteeship as was envisaged in Japanese peace treaty.” Story appears
                            under such headlines as “Return of all Ryukyus seen” and “Japan is seen
                            slated to get Ryukyus back”. Body of story quotes American officials as
                            saying return of Amami Oshima group had set “a precedent” which probably
                            would be followed when conditions permit relinquishment of American
                            control over rest of group. Although Hensley’s story does point out that
                            United States intends to stay for foreseeable future, nevertheless its
                            whole emphasis is on future return of Ryukyus rather than indefinite
                            American administration.</p>

                            distant future with the reestablishment of world security—especially
                            security of Asia.” If that reestablishment of security now seems much
                            more distant than <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            apparently then hoped, that is in no small part due to the fact that
                            Japan itself has not made the contribution to restoring security which
                            we had hoped. I am frankly disappointed that Japanese fallen far behind
                            Germany in recovery and willingness to contribute to security. I refer
                            not only to lag in rearmament, which contrasts sharply with German
                            readiness to rearm, but also to failure to exclude Communist influence
                            in labor unions, intelligentsia and youth circles, and widespread
                            Communist propaganda in Japan directly against the U.S. which makes a
                            very sharp contrast with the close and friendly relations between West
                            German people and the U.S. Also, the Japanese squandering of windfall
                            from Korean war rather than practice of austerity makes very bad
                            impression. Japanese are constantly asking more and more from U.S.
                            without feeling any obligation themselves to do what is necessary to
                            promote security in Asia.</p>

                        <p>I talked frankly along these lines to [<persName corresp="#p_IY1">Izeki</persName>?] personally when he came to see me<note n="3" xml:id="d726fn3">Reference uncertain.</note> and I think it is time
                            that the Japanese leaders realized they cannot expect forever to be on
                            the receiving end without any corresponding effort on their part.</p>
                        <p>I still have confidence that the Japanese people possess qualities
                            necessary to enable them to play a major role, but so far they certainly
                            have succeeded in keeping these qualities under wraps.</p>

                            While I agree Japanese performance to date in both defense and economic
                            fields leaves much to be desired, there has been considerable progress
                            in last few months. This is in large part due to frank presentation by
                            you to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> of situation as you
                            saw it. Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName>’s
                            forthright statements also had good long-run effect although there was
                            originally some bitterness.</p>
                        <p>If I may be permitted to be the Devil’s disciple for a moment, I should
                            like to review the situation in Japan as I see it. What follows is
                            dictated without benefit of my files in Tokyo but I believe it to be
                            substantially correct.</p>
                        <p>Japanese reluctance to rearm is at least in part due to American policy
                            and pressures during first years of occupation. This reluctance has been
                            widespread and Japanese Government has only recently been in a position
                            to carry majority of Diet with it in advocating hitherto unpopular
                            defense and economic measures.</p>
                        <p>With return to Liberal fold of majority of <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> party and with agreement reached with
                            sufficient members of Progressive <pb xml:id="pg_1574" n="1574" facs="0518"/>Party to ensure <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> carry through his policies, I look for
                            increasing tempo in carrying out defense measures and in enacting more
                            austere economic measures. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            is now in a position somewhat similar to that of Woodrow Wilson late
                            1916. He knows what should be done but is only now beginning to get
                            sufficient support both in the Diet and throughout the country to carry
                            out his intentions. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s 1917
                            should come within the next year.</p>
                        <p>Within past four months, there has been considerable change in thinking
                            of people. This has been reflected in agreement reached by <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> with his principal opposition to
                            a revision of National Safety Agency Law to make possible use of <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> to repel direct aggression as well as
                            put down internal subversion. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> told us last week that after considerable
                            argument he has now obtained agreement that resistance of external
                            aggression would have equal status with combatting subversion as
                            objectives of <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>. Opposition had held
                            out for first place going to latter while government advocated former as
                            chief ends of <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>. Equality was the
                            compromise but it is a step ahead. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> over protests of other
                            Cabinet Ministers have now obtained Cabinet agreement that defense
                            portion of new year’s budget will be only one to be increased. All
                            others will be reduced. This in face of great popular demand for
                            increase in flood relief appropriation and the 20 percent decline in
                            rice crop with the consequent necessity of importing far larger amounts
                            from abroad than planned.</p>
                        <p>Anti-American propaganda is definitely on the decline—it never was as bad
                            as the American press made out. The non-Communist Labor leaders are
                            slowly gaining influence—and the Bank of Japan is beginning to put the
                            brakes on wasteful spending. While much remains to be done, there has
                            been progress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>’s distress at the Okinawa
                            statement was, I believe, the instinctive emotional response to being
                            told large number of Japanese would remain indefinitely under foreign
                            rule. As I pointed out, however, he soon calmed down and recognized the
                            realities of the situation—and there have been no further recriminations
                            of any kind. Japanese Government leaders do, I believe, recognize their
                            obligations for helping create security in Asia but they cannot act
                            without consent of people’s representatives in Diet. To date, majority
                            of people have been saying “America disarmed us and told us anything
                            military was bad—now America wants us to rearm—all right, let the
                            Americans arm us”. Government leadership has been woefully weak and slow
                            in bringing about a change in this attitude—but again a beginning is
                            being made. In this connection, it should be recalled that our detailed
                            exposition to <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> in Washington
                            last fall was the first time any Japanese leader had been given a real
                            insight into the reasons back of our belief in the <pb xml:id="pg_1575" n="1575" facs="0519"/>necessity of speedy Japanese rearmament. Since
                            then, both General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> and I
                            have attempted to follow this up in Tokyo and we are just now beginning
                            to get results. Japanese pace is naturally slow and they do not move in
                            straight lines but if a graph were drawn, the curve would be seen to
                            tend upward.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and his
                            government offer the best hope for the immediate and mid-term future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> is getting stronger—to
                            some extent he gets stronger as people believe he is not an American
                            puppet. My understanding of your policy, with which I heartily agree, is
                            that we want allies, not satellites. The fact that Japanese are talking
                            back and not immediately saying “yes” to every American request is
                            indicative of a resurgence of the old Japanese spirit—if we can continue
                            to work with that and guide it, in the right direction, which I believe
                            we are now doing—we will have an ally with spirit, and eventually
                            strength, on whom we can rely.</p>
                        <p>The task will require firmness, when we think they are wrong, but above
                            all patience. The potential for good of the 85 million Japanese is so
                            great that I believe the task is well worth while.</p>
                        <p>May success continue to come to you and the President in your great
                            endeavors over the coming year.</p>

                        <p>As you know, there has been considerable discussion and interagency
                            review of the matter of the size of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> for Japan. At one point the proposal of the Pentagon
                            was for a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> totalling 1489 Americans
                            plus a sizable number of local employees. This would have made it by far
                            the largest <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in the world. We now
                            understand that the Defense Department and the Far East Command have
                            agreed on a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> of 878 Americans plus
                            a possible addition of 92 for a joint <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> headquarters. In addition there would be 1206 locals
                            plus possibly 75 more for the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            headquarters. These figures indicate that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> for Japan would still be the largest in the world. The
                            Embassy feels that there could be a further sizable cut in this latest
                            figure down to 500 Americans.</p>

                        <p>It has occurred to me as I have reviewed the latest draft telegram<note n="1" xml:id="d728fn1">Sent as telegram 1568 to Tokyo, Jan. 5. In it
                                the Department concluded: “Request Embassy discuss matter <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> in effort reach agreement. If

                            considerable amount of unrealistic planning is taking place. At the

                            realistic approach to the size of the forces which the United States is
                            urging them to provide for their own defense. Present Japanese plans
                            call for an increase of 24,000 in the ground force with a total increase
                            by March 31, 1955 in all of the armed forces of close to 45,000 over the
                            present 110,000.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, for the United States Government to undertake serious
                            negotiations with the Japanese with respect to a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> of the size proposed by Defense
                            would, in my opinion, expose the United States unnecessarily to serious
                            criticism as to the size of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            and the cost which this would entail for the Japanese in terms of such
                            local currencies as they may be required to provide.</p>
                        <p>May I suggest that the State Department strongly support Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> by urging upon the
                            Pentagon a far more realistic approach to the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in terms of the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>
                            program that materializes. To the extent that the Pentagon has in mind
                            other purposes to be served by the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            it may well be that at this stage they can be provided for in some other
                            way without bringing into focus the grossly disproportionate number of
                            people in relation to the size of any presently possible Japanese <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> program.</p>

                            the Budget to draft promptly an Executive Order, in consultation with
                            interested agencies, to formalize the delegation to the Department of
                            Defense of administrative responsibility, and serve as the public
                            document providing a “bill of rights” for the Ryukyuan people and giving
                            evidence of the responsible manner in which the United States proposes
                            to exercise its stewardship.</p>
                        <p rend="center">[Tab C]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary of Reconsideration of Directive in the
                            Light of Comments From Outside Sources</p>
                        <p>(1) The first group of comments goes to the underlying political decision
                            to retain the present degree of control indefinitely, and not to apply
                            for trusteeship. These points have some validity. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> argued the case for them in the past, but eventually
                            came to the conclusion that strategic considerations are overriding and
                            that the policies embodied in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            decision should be followed.</p>
                        <p>(2) The “legal structure”. The comments include significant questions on
                            the legal framework for the Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>The law applicable to all persons in the Ryukyu Islands under the
                            directive would be: (a) such legislation as has already been, or as
                            shall be enacted by the Government of the Ryukyu Islands (<gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss>) provided that it is not vetoed or
                            suspended by the US Civil Administration, and (b) such legislation as is
                            promulgated by the US Civil Administration directly. Generally speaking
                            the laws and Constitution of the United States will not be applicable in
                            the Ryukyu Islands. US courts may, however, hold certain specific US
                            statutes and provisions of the US Constitution to be applicable in the
                            Ryukyus, and it may at some time be desirable to ask the President to
                            specify by Executive Order that certain US statutes be made to apply in
                            the Ryukyus, for example, the Civil Aeronautics Act.</p>
                        <p>It is not considered desirable to ask Congress for an organic act for the
                            Government of the Ryukyus because such an act would imply more permanent
                            control over the Ryukyus than we intend to exercise and, by virtue of
                            such implication, would unnecessarily irritate the Japanese. The
                            arrangements for our exercise of control should be as authoritative as
                            possible—short of an organic act—and consequently the issuance of an
                            executive order, establishing the framework for our exercise of control
                            through the Department of Defense and such directive as may be issued,
                            is preferable to the issuance solely of a directive by the Joint Chiefs
                            to the Governor.</p>
                        <p>The questions concerning judicial remedies for persons who are not
                            Ryukyuan nationals have prompted a revision of the paragraph of the
                            directive dealing with the establishment of Ryukyuan courts <pb xml:id="pg_1579" n="1579" facs="0523"/>and the deletion of a
                            paragraph authorizing the Civil Administration to establish <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> tribunals to exercise jurisdiction in
                            specific individual cases of particular importance affecting United
                            States security and personnel. Under the proposed revision Ryukyuan
                            courts would exercise jurisdiction in all cases except cases of criminal
                            offenses committed by US military personnel, civilian employees or
                            dependents, who are subject to trial in US military courts under
                            provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This proposed
                            revision would eliminate the exercise of civil jurisdiction and criminal
                            jurisdiction by Civil Administration courts from which individuals would
                            have no right of appeal, and which are not subject to any statutory
                            safeguards of individual rights as are Ryukyuan courts and US military
                            courts established under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">The Governor</hi>. The term “Military Governor” has
                            been changed to “Governor” in the only place in which it appears. The
                            suggestions that the Governor and Deputy Governor be appointed by the
                            President of the United States has been adopted in paragraph A3 of the
                            revised directive. It is contemplated that the Commander in Chief, Far
                            East will be appointed as Governor.</p>
                        <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">The “primary mission”</hi>. Paragraphs 1 and 2
                            under B have been revised to make it clear that the well-being and good
                            government of the inhabitants of the islands are not merely by-products
                            of the security mission.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Exercise of a “security” veto over the Ryukyuan
                                Government</hi>. In recognition of the proposal that some restraint
                            be placed on the exercise of the veto power by the Governor, paragraph
                            C1 has been revised to provide that, except in emergencies, all of the
                            powers of the Civil Administration specified in the paragraph (to veto
                            or suspend laws, to promulgate laws, to review or modify court
                            decisions, to remove officials from office) will be exercised by the
                            Governor only after approval by the Secretary of Defense with the
                            concurrence of the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>(6) As suggested in the “Comments”, paragraph C2 has been eliminated and
                            will be made a part of a covering instruction rather than of the
                            Directive. However, the substance of subparagraph (f) has been retained
                            as the “bill of rights” for the Ryukyuan people.</p>
                        <p>(7) Paragraph H has been revised to eliminate the invidious comparison
                            between the standards of health and welfare which may be satisfactory
                            for the Ryukyuans and those which may be considered necessary for United
                            States personnel.</p>
                        <p>(8) Paragraph L has been revised to eliminate the qualification “to the
                            extent appropriated funds are available” from the requirement to make
                            “fair and prompt compensation” to the Ryukyuan people for the use of
                            their land and for their labor. Since existing <pb xml:id="pg_1580" n="1580" facs="0524"/>law imposes a bar against over-spending of an
                            appropriation, the qualification is unnecessary.</p>

                            Administration of Ryukyus Other Than Those Prompted by the Comments</p>
                        <p>1. The Preamble to the Directive has been revised to follow more exactly
                            the language of Article 3 of the Treaty of Peace.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe, as we urged in the Department of State presentation to the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board in connection
                            with the basic decision on the Ryukyus, that an Executive Order is
                            necessary in order to formalize the delegation to the Department of
                            Defense of responsibility for administration and to serve as the public
                            document which provides the “bill of rights” for the Ryukyuan people and
                            which gives evidence of the responsible manner in which the United
                            States proposes to exercise its stewardship. Much of the material from
                            the present Directive could be lifted bodily and incorporated into such
                            an Executive Order. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in acting on the Directive should request the Bureau of
                            the Budget, in consultation with other interested agencies, promptly to
                            develop the Executive Order. In the future it may be necessary to
                            propose that additional Executive Orders be issued which would make
                            certain US legislation applicable to the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> has had certain recent indications
                            that the question of compensation for the use of land is still a source
                            of considerable difficulty. We therefore propose to include in the
                            document transmitting the directive an instruction requiring the
                            submission of an early and detailed report by the Governor to the United
                            States Government on land compensation, and Paragraph J of the Directive
                            has been revised to state that the Civil Administration will consult
                            with local authorities on the selection of land for use.</p>
                        <p>4. It is planned in transmitting the Directive to instruct the Governor
                            of the Ryukyus to make semi-annual progress reports to the United States
                            Government on reduction of United States responsibility for civil
                            administration and, when feasible, to suggest specific plans for the
                            relinquishment of administrative responsibilities. Semiannual progress
                            reports will give the Operations Coordinating Board an opportunity for
                            periodic review of this question.</p>

                            Ryukyu Islands</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. The Underlying Political Decision</p>
                        <p>The directive itself does not deal with the basic political decision
                            involved in setting up a U.S. civil administration of the Ryukyu Islands
                            for an indeterminate future. These comments are made without reference
                            to any National Security Council paper presenting that problem.</p>
                        <p>The directive is apparently based upon the political assumption <hi rend="italic">either</hi> that the anticipated arrangement will be
                            reasonably satisfactory to the Japanese and the Ryukyuans <hi rend="italic">or</hi> that the arrangements must be carried through
                            despite their opposition.</p>
                        <p>If the proposed arrangement is not considered to be reasonably
                            satisfactory to the Japanese and the Ryukyuans, the gravity of the
                            political decision should not be minimized. So far as our relations with
                            the Japanese are concerned, the rapid rise of an irredentist issue over
                            the Ryukyus could seriously entangle U.S.-Japanese relations and
                            undermine the security position of the United States in Japan itself. In
                            the longer run, the attitude of Japan would appear to be infinitely more
                            important to us than our position in Okinawa. As for the Ryukyuans,
                            serious opposition to the arrangement would throw an issue of self
                            determination before the American people and before the rest of the
                            world in which the United States would be cast in the role of imposing
                            its rule upon several hundred thousand unwilling subjects of another
                            race and culture. Such a situation would cut across the conscience and
                            long tradition of our people and would greatly weaken our influence and
                            relationship with the peoples of Asia, the Middle East and even Latin
                            America. It would provide an issue easily exploitable by the Communists
                            and deepen the impression that the Soviet Union is the principal great
                            power ally of anti-colonial peoples. That the issue would be a false one
                            does not remove its dangers.</p>
                        <p>Can the above issues be met without endangering the military position
                            which the United States desires in the Ryukyus? They can be, at the cost
                            of some inconvenience and by accepting risks of a lesser order of
                            magnitude than those posed above.</p>
                        <p>First, it is not clear why a joint U.S.-Japanese Trusteeship of the
                            Ryukyus should not be submitted for approval to the United Nations.
                            While there is no obligation to do so under the terms of the Japanese
                            Peace Treaty, there is a strong implication that such a step would be
                            taken in the absence of the most compelling reasons. Such a Trusteeship
                            need not be “strategic” in type, subject to a <pb xml:id="pg_1582" n="1582" facs="0526"/>veto in the Security Council; it can be of the
                            general type, subject to General Assembly approval. There is no
                            provision which could be written in one type of Trust Agreement which
                            could not be written in the other; security matters can be effectively
                            dealt with. A joint U.S.-Japanese Trusteeship could make the Japanese
                            responsible for non-security matters and the U.S. responsible for
                            security. While the drawing of a line between the two functions might be
                            difficult, it can be done unless the United States wishes to exercise
                            its “security” responsibility in a frivolous and irresponsible manner,
                            far beyond the arrangements we are willing to accept in such places as
                            Hawaii, Alaska and other Pacific islands.</p>
                        <p>If a joint Trusteeship is believed unacceptable because we are fearful of
                            the longer-run attitude of the Japanese, it is suggested that Japan’s
                            attitude become our principal concern and that we deliberately move to
                            tie Japan to us with even stronger ties, one of which would be
                            partnership in the Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>A joint Trusteeship would be the surest safeguard against an issue of
                            self-determination being raised against us in the United Nations, for
                            the United Nations itself would have approved the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Second, if Trusteeship is unacceptable by the United States, it is
                            believed that certain steps could be taken to minimize the dangers
                            involved in the proposed arrangement. For example, the real position of
                            the United States under the arrangement is more favorable (in terms of
                            U.S., Japanese, Ryukyuan and world opinion) than the position which is
                            to be made public. This rests upon the understanding that the concept of
                            eventual return to Japan is not to be a part of the directive to be made
                            public. Can this be kept secret in any event? Will not political
                            pressures smoke out this concept? If so, why not make this clear at the
                            beginning?</p>
                        <p>Third, the arrangement in the Ryukyus might be linked more specifically
                            to other events in such a way as to explain U.S. desire for continued
                            control and to place a share of responsibility where it belongs, namely,
                            upon Communist aggression. For example, the United States might declare
                            that it is prepared to return the Ryukyus to Japan conditioned upon the
                            return of the Kuriles. Or we might declare that we will consider the
                            future of the Ryukyus after a satisfactory settlement in Korea,
                            Indo-China, and with respect to the general peace and security of the
                            Pacific area.</p>

                        <p>The following comments are offered on the draft directive, accepting the
                            underlying political assumption upon which it appears to rest:</p>

                                    <pb xml:id="pg_1583" n="1583" facs="0527"/>
                                    <item>Certain questions arise as to the legal position. It is
                                        clear that, as a matter of international law, the United
                                        States is entitled to exercise executive, legislative and
                                        judicial authority in the Ryukyus. It is not clear, as a
                                        matter of American law, how this authority is to be
                                        exercised. What law governs the American military
                                        establishment in the Ryukyus? Under what laws will U.S. and
                                        foreign civilians be governed? Are we planning to exercise
                                        residual governmental authority over several hundred
                                        thousand people by, in effect, military fiat established by
                                        an executive order? There is no indication that it is
                                        proposed to ask Congress for an organic act for the
                                        temporary government of the Ryukyus: would such be
                                        desirable? Will the laws and Constitution of the United
                                        States be applicable at least to U.S. and non-Ryukyuan
                                        aliens in the islands? Are all non-Ryukyuan personnel in the
                                        islands to become subject to the Uniform Code of Military
                                        Justice? Is this code adequate to cover the vast range of
                                        situations which might develop in governing the
                                        islands?</item>
                                    <item>It would seem to be completely fundamental that the
                                        exercise of American power over a population be on the basis
                                        of law, and that law be adequate and well known to all who
                                        come under it. The directive appears enlightened and
                                        satisfactory insofar as the law applicable to Ryukyuans is
                                        concerned. But except for U.S. military personnel under the
                                        Uniform Code of Military Justice, what recourse is there for
                                        any individual who feels himself the victim of an arbitrary
                                        act of military power? If the answer is “there is none”, the
                                        proposed arrangement would be intolerable.</item>

                                    <item>The directive purports to establish a “Civil
                                        Administration”; why not call the chief officer a “Governor”
                                        rather than a “Military Governor”, even if it is anticipated
                                        that he shall always be a military person? It is not easy to
                                        defend the governing of large numbers of people by a
                                        “Military Governor” in peace time; the term raises a false

                                    <item>Further, it is strongly recommended that the Governor and

                                        Ryukyus and would serve to remind the individuals concerned
                                        that they are carrying a very heavy responsibility which
                                        goes far beyond a routine military assignment.</item>

                                        Their safety, well being and good government are a first

                                    <item>Paragraph C. 2, on page 3 contains wholesome advice to the
                                        Governor in the direction of using his influence to insure
                                        developments in the islands which will not force him to use
                                        his residual authority. It is suggested that some of this
                                        material be dealt with in a supplementary instruction rather
                                        than in the directive itself. The publication of the present
                                        text would cast Ryukyuan authorities in the role of
                                        “puppets” and would arouse unnecessary cynicism about the
                                        nature of the self government which the directive tries to
                                        extend.</item>

                                        Ryukyuans and something quite different for Americans. This
                                        section is unnecessarily tactless and could provoke the
                                        deepest resentment in many parts of the world. We do not
                                        need to suggest that disease and filth are all right for
                                        some people, unless they get close enough to Americans to
                                        infect us. This is not a matter of substance, but of more
                                        skillful wording.</item>

                                    <item>Section L, page 9, in providing for fair and prompt
                                        compensation “to the extent appropriated funds are
                                        available” for Ryukyuan land, labor or other Ryukyuan
                                        resources by U.S. agencies, suggests the possibility that
                                        the Civil Administration may require private land, private
                                        labor and private resources for which it can not pay for
                                        lack of U.S. appropriated funds. This loophole should be
                                        plugged, at least for circumstances short of an actual
                                        operational military emergency. If the need is important
                                        enough to levy upon the Ryukyuans, it is important for
                                        Washington to bestir itself to find the necessary
                                        funds.</item>

                        <p>While the above comments have been largely confined to adverse criticism,
                            they have been directed toward suggestions for improvement of a
                            directive which, given its assumptions, is to be commended for its
                            breadth of spirit and its obvious attempt to remove some of the adverse
                            consequences of the underlying political decision. Had time been taken
                            to do so, specific compliments would have been directed to most of its
                            provisions. The primary questions are whether the United States
                            Government feels that it is fully satisfied with the basic political
                            decision and the legal framework within which the Civil Administration
                            would operate.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Confidential</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary: I have been concerned that the United States should
                            adequately and responsibly perform the difficult task of conducting
                            civil administration for the 700,000 alien people in the Japanese Treaty
                            Islands still under our control. Not only do we owe it to the people
                            themselves that we do a good job of administration, but we owe it to our
                            position in the United Nations and before world opinion generally that
                            we avoid any just criticisms of our performance. With these thoughts in
                            mind I have had the draft Civil Affairs Directive thoroughly examined
                            both inside and outside the Department of State. As a result of this
                            examination, I am sending you under cover of this letter a proposed
                            revision of the Directive.</p>
                        <p>I believe that you will find that the suggested changes are compatible
                            with military requirements, and that you will be able to agree that the
                            National Security Council should approve the Directive in the revised
                            form, as enclosed.<note n="1" xml:id="d730fn1">Not found attached, the

                        </p>
                        <p>In addition, I plan to suggest to the National Security Council that it
                            should direct the Bureau of the Budget to prepare promptly an Executive
                            Order which would formalize the delegation to the Department of Defense
                            of administrative responsibility and serve as the public document
                            providing a “bill of rights” for the Ryukyuan people and giving public
                            evidence of the responsible manner in which the United States proposes
                            to exercise its stewardship. Some of the language of the present
                            Directive can no doubt be utilized in the Executive Order creating the
                            United States Civil Administration. I hope that you will also be able to
                            agree to the suggestion for the prompt preparation of such an Executive
                                Order.<note n="2" xml:id="d730fn2">

                                    administration in the Ryukyu Islands was discussed at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting held on Jan. 14. The
                                    Council’s consideration of this topic is summarized in the
                                    memorandum of discussion as follows:</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> informed the
                                    Council that while the State Department had finally sent to the
                                    Defense Department its views with regard to the administration
                                    of the Ryukyus, the State proposals were of such a character
                                    that the Defense Department had not yet recovered from the
                                    shock. Accordingly, they would want another month before this
                                    subject received final consideration by the National Security
                                    Council. After the laughter had subsided, the President said
                                    ‘Don’t tell me that the State Department wants to take over the
                                    civil administration of the Ryukyus.’</p>

                                    a humorous vein, said that this appeared to be the essence of
                                    their proposal, but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> denied this, and said that State was
                                    merely proposing that the Governor of the Ryukyus be appointed
                                    by the President rather than by the Secretary of Defense.”

                            Ryukyu Islands were administered as enemy territory under U.S. military

                            Article 3 of the Peace Treaty have been and will continue to be

                            Defense, will in the future exercise all powers of the United States
                            with respect to the relations of the Ryukyu Islands with foreign
                            governments and international organizations.</p>

                                </ref>.</note> there are several general
                            points which should be emphasized. While program is still less than we
                            would have liked, nevertheless it represents increease over what
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> was talking about in
                            Washington and over what <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>
                            put forward on December 28. Even more significant is fact that no
                            attempt has been made this year in formulating Japanese defense budget
                            to reduce expenditures. This is in sharp contrast to attitude one year
                            ago when defense appropriations were cut by approximately 60 billion yen
                            from previous year. Amount allocated to National Safety Agency this year
                            is 20 billion yen more than in previous year’s budget. This, of course,
                            is obtained by saving of 5 billion yen in Japan’s contribution to United
                            States forces so that actual Japanese additional expenditure is only 15
                            billion yen. In opinion of Treasury Attaché <persName corresp="#p_DWW1">Diehl</persName>, inclusion in budget of 10 billion yen
                            reappropriation for relocation expenses is real victory for United
                            States. <persName corresp="#p_DWW1">Diehl</persName> is also of opinion
                            that while 20 billion yen estimated by Japanese to be rental value of
                            state-owned property turned over to United States security forces may be
                            somewhat exaggerated, nevertheless turning over of these properties does
                            represent real contribution by Japanese Government and even if it is
                            only half of amount estimated, it deserves consideration as part of
                            Japan’s defense contribution.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to over-emphasize problems Japanese Government has faced
                            and will continue to face in formulating budget wherein <pb xml:id="pg_1597" n="1597" facs="0541"/>only advances are in defense
                            items. There has been and continues to be considerable agitation against
                            decreases, particularly in such items as social security and welfare
                            funds. At least four Ministry of Finance officials have been physically
                            beaten by irate mobs protesting against budget cuts. Threats to other
                            Finance officials have been so common that budget examiners have been
                            taken to and from work in armored cars and have met in various places
                            throughout Tokyo other than Finance Ministry in order to avoid
                            protesting mobs. In spite of this agitation, government has so far
                            remained firm and this is due primarily to strong stand being taken from
                            very top by <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In our opinion chief United States interest is in seeing substantial
                            increase in numbers of personnel added to armed forces. We believe
                            present proposals do represent substantial increase and are most that
                            government can do politically at this time. Real significance should be
                            attached to addition of 33 persons for high-level liaison with United
                            States forces as this is first concrete step taken by Japanese to enable
                            them to carry out combined planning with United States forces which has
                            long been one of principal United States desiderata. The increase of 213
                            civilians to the staff of National Safety Agency to work directly under
                            Masahara is also of real importance as it indicates Japanese Government
                            means business in setting up real defense organization. The over-all
                            increase in defense manpower is slightly more than 33 percent, which in
                            light of still formidable opposition to rearmament is commendable. From
                            other Japanese Government sources we are informed that definite plans
                            and legislation are being formulated for creation of a reserve. These
                            plans not yet sufficiently concrete to report however.</p>
                        <p>In light of above it is our considered opinion that United States
                            agreement to some reduction in Japan’s contribution to United States
                            forces is Justified and would be real factor in encouraging Japan to
                            continue along road it has now at long last started. However, we believe
                            that full amount of 5 billion yen should not be agreed to. Therefore
                            request authority to tell Japanese on or before afternoon January 14
                            United States will accept reduction in Japanese contribution of
                            2,500,000,000 yen, providing force goals remain at approximate levels
                            given me last night.</p>
                        <p>Following is <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> position:</p>
                        <p>Although force increases are well below United States position, <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> concurs in belief that forces are
                            probably maximum that can be expected at this time. It is also
                            recognized that reduction of yen support of <gloss target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss> might encourage Japanese public support of <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_1598" n="1598" facs="0542"/>program. However, withdrawl
                            of this support will necessitate increased dollar appropriation.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Cabinet must submit to the Diet within the next few days the
                            national budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, with the support of
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, Ichimada, Governor of
                            the Bank of Japan, and other financial leaders, has made a strong plea
                            for a balanced budget and a reduction of governmental expenditures. (See
                            attached Embassy telegram 1624, Tab A.)<note n="1" xml:id="d733fn1">Dated Dec. 30, 1953, not printed. (794.5 <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/12–3053)</note> The preliminary budget submitted to
                            the Cabinet by the Finance Ministry on December 29 called for total
                            expenditures of 994 billion yen for the coming year, which is slightly
                            less than the current year’s budget and roughly half of the total budget
                            requests of the various ministries. If this budget is actually approved
                            by the Diet, it would be the first postwar year in which governmental
                            expenditures were reduced from the level of the previous year. The draft
                            budget provides for reductions in all major categories of expenditures
                            except defense which would be increased from 123 billion yen to 145
                            billion yen (plus a reappropriation of 10 billion yen of JFY1953–1954
                            funds).</p>
                        <p>In view of the opposition to rearmament and the great pressures for
                            increasing appropriations for public works, farm relief (necessitated by
                            last Year’s floods and typhoons), aid to small business, social
                            security, etc., it has taken considerable political courage on the part
                            of the Prime Minister to support a budget which actually calls for
                            reduced appropriations for all purposes except defense. It is uncertain
                            whether the austere budget proposed by the Finance Ministry will be
                            adopted, but for the first time the Prime Minister and his financial
                            advisers are willing to take a strong stand in favor of a sound
                            financial policy in spite of the political dangers involved.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1599" n="1599" facs="0543"/>
                        <p>Included in the draft budget is a figure of 57 billion yen ($158 million)
                            for support of United States forces stationed in Japan. This is 5
                            billion yen ($14 million) less than the Japanese are obligated to make
                            available to United States forces under the terms of Article 25 of the
                            Administrative Agreement. The Agreement itself contemplates a periodic
                            reexamination of the Japanese contribution, however, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> has asked for our concurrence by
                            January 14 in this proposed reduction.</p>
                        <p>Japanese defense plans for the coming fiscal year appear reasonably firm.
                            They call for an increase of about 32,000 uniformed personnel and 10,000
                            civilians, 7,000 of which will release uniformed personnel from clerical
                            and administrative positions. The actual increase, therefore, in the
                            number of uniformed personnel available for military service will be
                            about 39,000. This is an increase of about 33 percent over present
                            strength. This program is not appreciably better, from our point of
                            view, from that proposed to us by <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>
                            talked in terms of an increase of 35,000 uniformed personnel. Thus the
                            present program calls for 3,000 fewer new recruits than proposed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, but, due to the
                            transfer of 7,000 uniformed personnel out of clerical jobs, the
                            effective strength of the National Safety Force will be increased by
                            4,000 more than <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> indicated.
                            The Japanese goals, accordingly, are lower than we have hoped, but
                            represent considerable progress toward acceptance of their
                            responsibilities for self-defense, and are believed by our Embassy to be
                            the most that the Government can do politically at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has proposed that we agree to a reduction of 2.5 billion yen
                            ($7 million) in the contribution to United States forces. (See Embassy

                            reduction, but in view of the cuts being made in other elements of the

                            favorable political effect. It would not only indicate our general

                            Embassies to come in for the purpose of reviewing the Japanese defense
                            program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName>
                            summarized recent developments and future plans with respect to the

                        <p>The New Zealand and Australian representatives indicated a particular
                            interest in the development of Japan’s naval forces and asked if any
                            carriers or cruisers would be provided the Japanese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName> replied that the United
                            States had no plans at this point of providing Japan with any naval
                            vessels larger than a destroyer. He mentioned that in addition to naval
                            vessels, consideration was being given to the possibility of providing
                            an auxiliary supply vessel. He also stated that the Japanese had
                            requested two coastal submarines for use in anti-submarine training and
                            that this request was under consideration. The New Zealand and
                            Australian representatives indicated that this might cause their
                            governments some concern and urged that information on this be handled
                            carefully. They requested specific information regarding the size and
                            range of the submarines which might be provided which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName> agreed to make available
                            when definite plans had been developed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName> stressed the classified nature of information
                            which had been provided.<note n="2" xml:id="d734fn2">In a memorandum of
                                a conversation held with J.L. Allen on Feb. 23, <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName> quoted an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> handed him by Allen, which
                                stated the Australian Government’s view that submarines should not
                                be given or lent to Japan even for training in antisubmarine
                                warfare. “Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName> said
                                that there was no likelihood that a submarine would be transferred
                                to the Japanese in the near future in any event, and that perhaps
                                something could be worked out to avoid any possibility that this
                                issue would be injected into the Australian election campaign.”

                                (694.0026/1–2654)</note> in which he reviewed Japanese attitudes
                            with respect to the question of war criminals sentenced by the United
                            States and proposed a reexamination of our present policy with a view to
                            granting general amnesty, or if such procedure was unacceptable, the
                            speeding up of releases by the Clemency and Parole Board. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> indicated that the
                            question of war criminals in Japan was becoming a farce in view of the
                            Japanese Government’s laxity of control over the prisoners who were
                            permitted to attend baseball games and other activities in Tokyo.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> indicated that
                            he was aware of the problems facing <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>
                            with respect to an amnesty for German war criminals and inquired if it
                            would be possible to take some action less than amnesty with respect to
                            the Japanese war criminals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> indicated that the Board
                            of Clemency and Parole had to date paroled 113 persons, that the
                            majority of the remaining prisoners were sentenced to fairly long terms
                            of life imprisonment and had been guilty of particularly heinous crimes.
                            He pointed out that the Board was operating on the Federal system for
                            the granting of parole—a procedure that had originally been instituted
                            by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. He also pointed out that under
                            this system those persons sentenced to life imprisonment would not be
                            eligible for parole until 1960 or 1961. He noted that in some instances
                            the Board had granted a reduction of sentence so as to make the prisoner
                            eligible for parole. He indicated that this procedure could and would be
                            followed in the future but that a number of cases fell into such a
                            heinous category that the prisoners might never be granted parole or
                            clemency. He noted that it would be possible for the Board to change the
                            “ground rules” so as to make lifers eligible for parole after serving 10
                            instead of 15 years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Raymond<note n="3" xml:id="d735fn3">Assistant Legal Adviser for
                                German Affairs.</note> indicated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> felt strongly that a grant of amnesty would
                            undermine the entire legal basis of the war crime trials in that amnesty
                            or pardon had the effect of wiping out the crime. He indicated that the
                            grant of parole or clemency fell into a different category and did not
                            necessarily prejudice the legal basis of the trials. On his arrival Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> reiterated this point.
                            Mr. Bonbright stated that while a grant of general amnesty to Japanese
                            war criminals would seriously affect the German question, <pb xml:id="pg_1603" n="1603" facs="0547"/>a speeding up of the process
                            of the granting of parole and clemency within the framework of the

                            for the release of Japanese war criminals, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> indicated that the sentiment
                            came from all quarters, that various organized groups frequently called
                            at the Embassy to discuss this question and that it was often raised in
                            personal conversations by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>. Mrs. Dunning pointed out that the situation in
                            Japan differed in at least one particular aspect from that in Germany in
                            that the Philippine and Chinese Governments had granted amnesty to
                            Japanese war criminals sentenced by their courts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> pointed out, however, that a
                            number of war criminals sentenced by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia and the Netherlands were still incarcerated
                            in Sugamo Prison and that these outnumbered those sentenced by US
                            courts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> queried Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> if the Clemency and
                            Parole Board in considering the cases of prisoners who had committed
                            acts against Filipinos and Chinese were taking into consideration the
                            action of the Philippine and Chinese Governments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> answered in the affirmative. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> also indicated that the
                            Embassy in commenting upon the cases had recommended against parole or
                            clemency in 69 cases. He also added that the Japanese Government had not
                            yet submitted recommendations with respect to all of the prisoners in
                            Sugamo Prison.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> then suggested that
                            the group consider the recommendations submitted by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>. With respect to the suggestion
                            that the Clemency and Parole Board receive authority to make final
                            decisions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> pointed out
                            that the President had established the Board by Executive Order, had
                            taken a personal interest in the recommendations of the Board and had
                            turned down several of these recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> suggested that in
                            the future it might be desirable to meet Japanese pressure by
                            publicizing the crimes for which the various prisoners had been
                            sentenced, emphasizing the reaction in this country to the seriousness
                            of such crimes, and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> might make this point in meeting pressure from
                            Japanese Government officials. It was generally agreed that this course
                            in addition to a continued expeditious handling of cases by the Clemency
                            and Parole Board was the only feasible action to be taken at this
                            time.</p>

                        <p>In accordance with your suggestion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> and I met yesterday with General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>, General Ogden, Admiral Davis and
                            some others from Defense to discuss the differences between State and
                            Defense on the text of the Civil Affairs Directive for the Ryukyus. With
                            one exception we were able to reach agreement on the attached draft (Tab
                                A).<note n="2" xml:id="d736fn2">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>That one exception occurs on page 2 of the Directive. The language we had
                            agreed upon yesterday would have required that the Governor of the
                            Ryukyu Islands be appointed by the President upon recommendation of the
                            Secretary of Defense. Since our meeting, Defense changed the language to
                            read “His name will be submitted to the President by the Secretary of
                            Defense for approval.” I believe that this misses the point, and that it
                            is important to give the Governor the added prestige of appointment by
                            the Chief Executive of the United States. I therefore recommend that you
                            urge the National Security Council to accept the language agreed upon
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>In other respects I believe that the attached draft represents a
                            reasonable position and that it incorporates a substantial portion of
                            the changes suggested by the Secretary in his letter of January 11 to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. It includes the
                            statement dictated by the Secretary as to the mission of the United
                            States Civil Administration but adds some Defense Department language
                            concerning the primary responsibility of the Civil Administration. It
                            eliminates the gap which existed in the earlier draft of the Directive
                            with respect to civil and criminal jurisdiction over non-Ryukyuans who
                            are not employed by the United States armed forces.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it does not require the prior approval by the United
                            States Government of the exercise of the emergency powers to suspend
                            actions of the local government, although it does require prompt reports
                            to Defense and State when the power is exercised. Another item missing
                            from the attached draft is a requirement <pb xml:id="pg_1605" n="1605" facs="0549"/>for periodic progress reports on the reduction of
                            responsibility for civil administration.</p>

                        <p>I recommend that you support the attached draft at the National Security

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commented that after
                            eight long months the lion and the lamb had at last agreed to lie down
                            together, since he was informed that the Departments of State and
                            Defense had reached agreement as to the directive in question. Whether
                            the lion was actually on top of the lamb, as had been hinted, was
                            something which he would leave Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> to state.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> said that four
                            days ago, when the text of the directive had been presented to him, it
                            had included five foolscap pages of disagreements between State and
                            Defense. Happily, General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>
                            had been on hand in Washington, and a conference had been arranged which
                            had ironed out all these disagreements. Accordingly, when the text had
                            left this conference Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> had believed that it represented complete
                            agreement between the two departments. Since then, however, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> gathered that Defense
                            had suggested one additional “slight change”. To this, which called for
                            the nomination of the Governor of the Ryukyus by the Secretary of
                            Defense, the State Department disagreed. State still believed that the
                            President should appoint the Governor on the recommendation of the
                            Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> said that while he had
                            got his copy of the draft directive only at 5:15 the previous day, a
                            brief glance was sufficient to make the Budget Bureau fear that it moved
                            too far away from the area of civilian control and placed too much
                            authority in the hands of the Defense Department.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KRM1">Kyes</persName> replied that if the
                            arrangement in the present draft prevailed and the Defense Department
                            revision was not accepted, the President would be obliged to have his
                            candidate for the <pb xml:id="pg_1607" n="1607" facs="0551"/>Governorship confirmed by the Senate, even though by terms of the
                            directive this Governor was to be a military officer. This seemed a
                            needless complication.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> disagreed with the
                            view of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KRM1">Kyes</persName>, and the
                            President added that of course he made a good many appointments without
                            Senate confirmation.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> commented that quite
                            possibly all this was a mere fuss over wording. As far as he was
                            concerned—and, of course, among the hats he was now wearing was that of
                            Governor of the Ryukyus—either wording would be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> reminded the
                            Council that the Secretary of State had felt very strongly that the
                            Governor of the Ryukyus should not be a military man. In view of the
                            many modifications and concessions which he had already made to meet the
                            views of the Defense Department, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> suggested that it would be best if the Council
                            postponed action until Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> returned from Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that of course there was no use kidding ourselves
                            that we were holding on to Okinawa for any other purpose than to protect
                            our security in the Pacific. For that reason we needed a military
                            commander there.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> added that all
                            those who had participated in the conference to reach agreement on this
                            text, including himself, had agreed that the present draft constituted a
                            satisfactory and decent arrangement. It provided, on the one hand, for
                            the Department of Defense the control that it needed in the interests of
                            security; while, on the other, it gave at least a flavor of civilian
                            administration. He then reiterated his belief that the Governor of the
                            Ryukyus should be appointed by the President and not by the Secretary of
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>The President said that, above all, he did not want another row such as
                            had occurred between <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Taft</persName> in the Philippines in
                            1908 because a civilian administration for these islands had been set up
                            too early. Furthermore, continued the President, he didn’t think that
                            the formula for appointment of the Governor was really the guts of the
                            problem. He had some doubts as to whether it was wise to name a military
                            man at all. Would it not be better to name as Governor a civilian,
                            perhaps an Assistant Secretary of Defense?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KRM1">Kyes</persName> said that of course
                            the main thing was to assure adequate control of operations by the
                            Department of Defense, since Okinawa was our great bastion of defense
                            for the Pacific. Moreover, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KRM1">Kyes</persName>, we feel that political pressures will generate and
                            make things very difficult for us if we proceed too rapidly in creating
                            a genuine civilian administration in the Ryukyus.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1608" n="1608" facs="0552"/>
                        <p>The President said that in any event he did not see that any particular
                            urgency attached to the problem at this precise moment. It would become
                            urgent only when our forces were removed from Japan and Okinawa became
                            the more important base. Accordingly, the President said he was not
                            inclined to make any decision until Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> returned. He was, after all, a
                            very “wise fellow” in these affairs. The question of who appointed the
                            Governor of the Ryukyus, continued the President with some force, was
                            nobody’s business but his. Whether or not he delegated to the Secretary
                            of Defense his prerogative of appointment was wholly his decision.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> asked the
                            President’s permission to offer a few points for his consideration.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> said that he had
                            recently been obliged, in his capacity as Governor, to appoint certain
                            judges for the Ryukyus. The candidates from whom he had to make his
                            selection were of pretty poor caliber. This was an indication that the
                            peoples of the Ryukyus not only did not understand democracy, but were
                            incompetent to run their own affairs. Since our only real reason to be
                            in these islands was a military reason, he had no personal concern as to
                            who appointed the Governor. But he felt that it would be useful for the
                            President to know about his experience with these recent
                            appointments.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded the discussion by indicating the need to make a
                            judgment between the military requirements and the political
                            appearances.</p>

                            addressed a large group of military and civilian personnel in the

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> described the
                            current status of Japanese defense plans and the difficulties which they
                            face. He stressed the fact that the present Government had crossed a
                            major stream in the presentation of current defense plans to the
                            Japanese Diet and in recommending a change, in the assigned mission of
                            the Japanese forces. He pointed out that while the steps which the
                            Japanese were taking were slower than we would like, and there was every
                            reason to malntain a continued pressure upon the Japanese in private
                            interviews with Japanese leaders, it could he adverse to our interests
                            publicly to criticize the pace of their rearmament.</p>

                            the 2 1/3 divisions now there could create serious political

                            readiness of the Japanese to use the equipment in question. The main
                            difficulty expressed by the Committee, however, was the relationship of
                            this legislation to the Mutual Security legislation, and its apparent
                            open-ended character. It was suggested, for instance, that it might be
                            necessary to put in an amount, e.g., $500 million, which the transfers
                            could not exceed. Senator Saltonstall said that he would ask Mr. Hensel
                            to confer with him privately on how the bill could be redrafted to avoid
                            objections.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> was interrogated on
                            a wide variety of questions concerning both Japan and Korea. In reply to
                            a question on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> offer of a
                            division for Laos, he said that in his opinion the transfer of one
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division would not have serious
                            effect upon his military mission as United Nations Commander in Korea.
                            He intimated that there were objections of other kinds but did not
                            enlarge upon it.</p>
                        <p>On February 23 staff officers of Defense conferred with the staff of the
                            Senate Committee preparatory to Hensel’s meeting with Senator
                            Saltonstall. The Committee staff urged inclusion in the <pb xml:id="pg_1611" n="1611" facs="0555"/>Mutual Security Act (which
                            Defense strongly opposes) and the insertion of a ceiling of some
                            character on the equipment to be transferred. Defense has asked Army to
                            make a study of the possibility of an acquisition—cost valuation, which
                            would reduce the figure from about $500 million to about $250 million.
                            They also discussed the possibility of a proviso requiring the amount
                            and character of equipment to be reported to and approved by the
                            Congressional Committees.<note n="3" xml:id="d740fn3">Next to this

                                which would follow the former bill but would add a provision

                            modified to conform with agreements negotiated with other countries—thus
                            making the agreement more acceptable to the Japanese. The provisions

                            the Agreement have been tightened. The article and annex dealing with

                                attached),<note n="1" xml:id="d742fn1">Not found attached.</note>
                            following is negotiating history of annex on scope of assistance:</p>
                        <p>Early in the negotiation (August) the Japanese proposed a number of
                            changes in the United States draft which would give an economic window
                            dressing to the military assistance agreement. The purpose of this
                            approach was to make the agreement more palatable to the Diet and also
                            to insert a wedge in the United States position that no direct economic
                            assistance was to be given to Japan. While the Japanese were forced to
                            accept the United States position that most of their proposals had no
                            place in a military assistance agreement, the Embassy (August 31)
                            recommended acceptance of a boiled down statement covering those points
                            which the United States was already in the process of implementing or
                            was fully prepared to do. The Department watered down this statement
                            even further—authorizing on September 3 inclusion of the following
                            statement in the minutes or if necessary in an annex:</p>
                        <list>
                     <item>“During course discussion concerning present agreement, representatives
                            Government of United States stated that, in view desirability from point
                            view both Governments that defense industries Japan be developed and
                            modernized, US Government will give every consideration, to extent other
                            factors will permit, to procurement in Japan of supplies and equipment
                            to be made available to Japan, as well as to other countries, where
                            feasible, and to providing information to and facilitating the training
                            of technicians from Japan’s defense-production industries. The
                            representatives of both governments recognized advisability establishing
                            adequate liaison between two governments to facilitate US procurement in
                            Japan.”</item>
                  </list>
                        <p>The Japanese in early October proposed the addition of a statement on the
                            part of their representative to the effect that the development of
                            Japan’s defense capacities would greatly be facilitated if the US would
                            give consideration to furnishing Japan with such items as machine tools
                            and financing to her production industry. On October 24, in view of the
                            US proposal on Section 550 the Department authorized the acceptance of
                            this proposal provided the <pb xml:id="pg_1614" n="1614" facs="0558"/>reference to machine tools was deleted. (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 977).<note n="2" xml:id="d742fn2">Not printed.

                        <p>In summary the inclusion of this annex was based on the following
                            considerations:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. The desirability of giving the military agreement a slight
                                economic overtone insofar as defense industries were
                                concerned.</item>
                            <item>2. The United States has developed in the past and is continuing a
                                program of offshore procurement in Japan. This year’s program will
                                total about $100 million.</item>
                            <item>3. The Department of Defense has undertaken a program of providing
                                information to and facilitating the training of technicians from
                                Japan’s defense-production industries.</item>

                        <p>Transcript reads: “There is target figure we talked about as long ago as
                            time <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> here last October for
                            offshore procurement in Japan during this US fiscal year. That target
                            figure is $100 million. It not commitment but what we think will
                            probably be spent there. Actually I expect it may be little more rather
                            than less. I think use of figures caused confusion. This Agreement like
                            any other Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement—and there are lots of
                            them—simply states terms and conditions under which military assistance
                            will be provided. It does not specify and is not meant to any specific
                            amount or type assistance. That remains to be worked out between experts
                            both sides.”</p>

                        <p>When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> was here
                            in February he mentioned to you a memorandum prepared for him by the
                            Embassy staff on Communist Influence in the Japanese Trade Union
                            Movement. A summary of this memorandum follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1618" n="1618" facs="0562"/>
                        <p>While there is a good deal of evidence to show extensive Communist
                            influence and manipulation of the Japanese trade union movements,
                            reaction against this infiltration is developing both within and outside
                            the trade unions. This, rather than Communist ascendancy, has been the
                            outstanding development during the last year in the Japanese trade union
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>It became increasingly clear during 1953 that the pro-Communist positions

                            regard to ability of Japanese economy to meet such increases, criticism
                            of <gloss target="#t_ICFTU1">ICFTU</gloss> and several abortive efforts
                            to organize an Asian Trade Union Congress in opposition to <gloss target="#t_ICFTU1">ICFTU</gloss>—represented chiefly the thinking of
                            a minority sector of Communist cells, holding key posts and working

                            unions), the one and a half million workers who belong to independent

                            leaders, who by the end of the year began to revolt against Takano and
                            his pro-Communist leadership and to make plans to oust him as
                            Secretary-General of <gloss target="#t_Sohyo1">Sohyo</gloss> by
                            mid-1954.</p>
                        <p>This curious state of affairs has evolved because of the infancy of the
                            Japanese trade union movement, which is influenced by the primitive
                            Marxist concepts which dominated it before the war; the reluctance of
                            anti-Communist union leaders to expel Communists from their unions on
                            the grounds that “democracy” tolerates all opinions; the natural
                            reaction of the Japanese against 7 years occupation which Takano and the
                            Communists made the most of; fear of union leaders who disagreed with
                            Takano’s radical policies to speak out publicly and willingness on their
                            part to capitalize on the anti-American tide which was running strong
                            during the first half of 1953; immobilization of the Left Socialist
                            Party, which is predominantly neutralist, by fear of losing <gloss target="#t_Sohyo1">Sohyo</gloss>’s potent political support if it
                            forced a break.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_Sohyo1">Sohyo</gloss>’s convention last July marked the
                            high point of Communist and Takano’s strength since 1949 and the
                            beginning of the reaction against these. Despite the subsiding since
                            then of anti-Americanism, <pb xml:id="pg_1619" n="1619" facs="0563"/>making it less dangerous for union leaders to take a balanced view of
                            United States–Japan relations, Takano has persisted in keeping to a
                            pro-Communist course. The result has been the secession of the Minroren
                            unions and increasing estrangement from the Left Socialist union leaders
                            in <gloss target="#t_Sohyo1">Sohyo</gloss>, previously Takano’s chief
                            support. In late 1953, Minroren gathered its forces to organize an
                            anti-Communist federation of labor (called Zenro)<note n="4" xml:id="d747fn4">National Council of Japanese Labor Unions.</note>
                            in opposition to <gloss target="#t_Sohyo1">Sohyo</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Developments outside trade union ranks are also restricting both
                            Communist influence in the unions and the unions’ ability to influence
                            Japanese opinion. Among the most important of these outside forces are
                            the growing cohesion of conservative forces; increasing assurance and
                            more effective techniques of employers in dealing with labor demands and
                            union “struggle tactics”; changing attitude on the part of the press;
                            and a developing attitude that labor activity in the first year and a
                            half after the end of the occupation was one of that period’s excesses
                            that demands correction.</p>
                        <p>The new power relationship evolving in Japanese society, assisted by the
                            requirements of an austerity program, can be expected to result in a
                            diminution of labor as well as Communist influence.</p>

                        <p>With the signing of the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement with Japan on
                            March 8 and the recent submission to the Diet by, the Japanese Cabinet
                            of a defense plan for the coming year calling for a moderate increase in
                            Japanese defense forces, it would appear timely for the interested
                            agencies of the United States Government to begin planning the military
                            aid to be provided Japan out of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>54 and
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>55 mutual defense assistance funds.
                            The Diet must ratify the aid agreement before it becomes effective, but
                            we anticipate favorable Diet action within three to six weeks.</p>
                        <p>In anticipating the signing of the aid agreement, <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> has urged the working level of <gloss target="#t_OMA1">OMA</gloss> to begin planning the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>54 aid program.</p>

                        <p>In spite of assurances during and since the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> talks that the required aid would be forthcoming
                            when the agreement comes into force, we are now unable to get from
                                <gloss target="#t_OMA1">OMA</gloss> any indication of the aid which
                            can be made available to Japan during the balance of this fiscal year
                            except aid for the ground forces which will be supplied from the
                            previously authorized $528 million Army program. The reasons given at
                            the <gloss target="#t_OMA1">OMA</gloss> working level for their
                            inability to move on the Japan program are: (1) <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>54 requirements for Indochina, which have top priority,
                            are still indefinite and this has necessitated a temporary freeze of all
                            other Title III programs; and (2) Japanese requirements cannot be
                            determined until the aid agreement is ratified<note n="1" xml:id="d748fn1">The <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> Agreement

                                Government from the Japanese Government of written notice of
                                Japanese ratification.</note> and detailed discussions take place

                        <p>We fully appreciate the need for priority treatment of the Indochina

                            meet the most urgent of Japan’s requirements. As to the second reason

                            have been going on in Tokyo between the Far East Command and the
                            Japanese for some months and the Command has made specific
                            recommendations as to aid requirements for the Japanese fiscal year
                            beginning April 1. Obviously no aid can be delivered until the aid
                            agreement is ratified, but <hi rend="italic">it is possible to take

                        <p>With respect to the Japanese Air Force, the Far East Command has made
                            specific recommendations as to the number (166) and types (primarily
                            trainers) of aircraft which the Japanese can utilize in the year
                            beginning April 1. (See page 2 of attachment I).<note n="2" xml:id="d748fn2">Telegram CX 67032 from <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> to the Department of the Army, Feb. 6, not

                            <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> considers the Japanese Air Force

                            Command recommendations. As you may know, the Japanese at present do not
                            have an air force but have included funds in their budget for the year
                            beginning April 1, 1954 for a force of over 5000 men. With respect to

                            on the phone earlier this week, we believe it essential to include Japan
                            for a specific amount in the illustrative program now being readied for
                            the Congressional presentation. It is virtually certain that our
                            military aid agreement with Japan will come into force before the end of
                            this fiscal year and will require implementation on our part during
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>55. <hi rend="italic">It would be
                                most damaging politically, after such strenuous efforts to conclude
                                the aid agreement and our repeated assurances to the Japanese that
                                aid would be forthcoming, if Japan were to be excluded from the
                                    <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>55 program</hi>.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if you could discuss these questions with General
                            Stewart within the next few days. I would be happy to provide you with
                            additional background on the Japanese program and to participate in your

                        </list>
                        <p>The recent experiences of representatives of three well-known American
                            firms, Studebaker Corporation, Schaeffer Pen Company, and Coca-Cola
                            Corporation, in attempting to make equity investments in Japan,
                            underlines the Embassy’s long-standing belief (previously reported, most
                            recently in Embassy Despatches 623 of October 9, 1953; 753 of November
                            5, 1953; and 919 of December 14, 1953),<note n="3" xml:id="d750fn3">None
                                printed. (811.05194/10–953, 811.05194/11–553, and 811.05194/12–1453,
                                respectively)</note> that responsible Japanese Government officials
                            do not favor the introduction into Japan of equity capital. This
                            attitude has been especially evident in those instances where private
                            foreign capital, particularly American, desired to make investments
                            involving majority ownership and control. However, it has also been
                            applied in other cases. The chief difficulty, the Embassy believes, is
                            the unwarranted fear that foreign capital will result in competition
                            which will be detrimental to domestic producers. There is also reason to
                            believe that this view is shared by a significant number (perhaps a
                            majority) of business leaders. This attitude is adhered to adamantly
                            despite the general admission that Japan is in need of foreign capital.
                            Capital is desired but on Japanese terms. This is defined generally to
                            mean in the form of loans or technological assistance agreements
                            involving royalty arrangements for the transfer of patent and industrial
                            know-how for a stipulated period. With only a few conspicuous
                            exceptions, postwar investments have been almost entirely in these two
                            categories. There is every indication that this trend will continue, as
                            evidenced by the latest overt <pb xml:id="pg_1624" n="1624" facs="0568"/>display of hostility to the proposals made by Studebaker, Schaeffer,
                            and Coca-Cola. Pertinent elements of the proposed investment plans of
                            these three companies follow:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Studebaker Corporation</p>
                        <p>This company has concluded an agreement with the Daihatsu Company, a
                            large manufacturer of three-wheel vehicles in Japan, under which the
                            latter would produce Studebaker automobiles under a mutually
                            satisfactory arrangement. In this case, Studebaker did not request
                            either majority ownership or control. The extent of its participation
                            was to supply knock-down assembly units, technical and managerial
                            know-how, a limited amount of specialized machinery, and the facilities
                            of its world-wide sales organization to market Japan-made Studebakers.
                            It was agreed that as many parts as possible would be purchased locally,
                            initially this was to include batteries, tires, upholstery, steering
                            wheels, hardware, and accessories. Eventually, additional parts would be
                            purchased in Japan. In this way, foreign exchange expenditures could be
                            reduced to the very minimum and greater opportunities would be given to
                            the utilization of local facilities, thereby providing employment, a new
                            source of tax revenue and, perhaps most important, contribute foreign
                            exchange to Japan. A lesser but by no means insignificant contribution
                            envisaged was to make a high quality car (compared with domestic makes)
                            available for domestic consumers at a price considerably below that
                            currently quoted on Japanese cars. Moreover, the Studebaker would be
                            suitable for the Japanese market because it is light, has a short wheel
                            base and reputed economy in fuel consumption.</p>
                        <p>Several discussions were held between Mr. Dewey Smith, the Studebaker
                            representative, who came to Japan to negotiate the agreement, and
                            Japanese Government officials. He also sought the advice of Embassy
                            officers. It was apparent that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> was anxious to conclude the arrangement and was
                            willing to make concessions to achieve his objective. He altered his
                            proposal several times in the hope of satisfying Japanese Government
                            officials but to no avail. He even went so far as to guarantee to the
                            Japanese Government that the Japanese company would not ask for more
                            foreign exchange than it earned, after a reasonable preparatory period.
                            Furthermore, he obtained agreement from Studebaker dealers in Argentina
                            that they would purchase 50 cars per month from Japan, if the price
                            would not be more than $100 per unit higher than similar cars from the
                            Studebaker plant in South Bend, Indiana. He also stressed that vigorous
                            efforts would be made to expand the market in Southeast Asia for
                            Japan-made Studebakers, and as a start, whenever possible, consideration
                            would be given to <pb xml:id="pg_1625" n="1625" facs="0569"/>supplying
                            the present market in certain Asian countries from Japan. In this
                            connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName> indicated
                            that during the year 1952 approximately 5,000 Studebaker cars had been
                            exported from the United States to various Asian countries. He envisaged
                            that Japan could secure 10 percent of this total.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Schaeffer Company</p>
                        <p>The Schaeffer Pen Company has indicated interest in establishing a joint
                            Japanese-American company to produce fountain pens for sale in Japan and
                            abroad, primarily in the Far East. Under the proposed arrangement, the
                            joint company would produce the pen cases and other parts, and only the
                            fillers and points would be imported. A small allocation of dollars
                            would be required, estimated at about $20,000 for a six-month period.
                            The Schaeffer representative alleged that it had a market for such pens
                            in <gloss target="#t_PX1">PX</gloss>s, Ship Stores and Far Eastern
                            countries, and his company was willing to guarantee that the arrangement
                            would generate more foreign exchange than requested for the importation
                            of parts. In fact, he was reasonably certain that this would approximate
                            half again as much as the dollar allocation required for such imports.
                            He also sought to import ink concentrate for bottling in Japan, all
                            other requirements, including bottles to be manufactured in that
                            country.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Coca-Cola</p>
                        <p>This company indicated its willingness to guarantee the development of an
                            export business in bottles, cases, advertising, ingredients, building
                            supplies, coolers, and other allied products which, based on a
                            conservative estimate, would exceed by 100 percent the dollar exchange
                            required for syrup for domestic bottling and distribution. In support of
                            this contention, the firm submitted a statement to the effect that,
                            during the period July, 1952 through November, 1953, it had generated
                            exports in these items of approximately $1,500,000 from Japan through
                            sales to Guam, Okinawa, and Korea. Based on a recent market analysis,
                            the company was convinced that it could expand this export business and
                            make cocacola available to the Japanese at a reasonable price. As both
                            domestic and export sales increased, additional benefits would accrue to
                            the Japanese economy in the form of capital expenditures for land,
                            buildings, and machinery. The business would provide additional
                            employment, tax revenues, improved techniques in the soft drink
                            industry, and an expanded market for other Japanese raw materials and
                            products.</p>
                        <p>Despite the repeated efforts on the part of Embassy officers over an
                            extended period to impress upon Japanese officials the beneficial
                            effects to the Japanese economy of various investment proposals of a
                            similar nature to those made by the aforementioned companies, <pb xml:id="pg_1626" n="1626" facs="0570"/>no improvement in their
                            restrictive attitude is discernible. As a matter of fact, from the
                            discussions recently held on these three cases with officers in the
                            Economic Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there is reason to
                            believe that the arguments have fallen on deaf ears. The same cliches
                            were expounded; they all appear to be intellectual rationalizations for
                            a fundamentally emotional attitude which manifests itself in fear and
                            suspicion of foreign equity capital investment.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office officials indicated on behalf of the Ministry of
                            International Trade and Industry (<gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>)
                            that these three projects were unacceptable. The principal reason given
                            was that the firms involved were unable to positively assure that
                            exports would actually develop, and therefore the proposals might
                            constitute a drain on Japan’s limited dollar exchange holdings. This
                            attitude is yet another example of the basic inability of many Japanese
                            bureaucrats to think in terms of a market as dynamic and not static.
                            Therefore, they discount the idea of selling cars or coca-cola or other
                            items to Argentina or Southeast Asia or elsewhere in larger quantities
                            at lower prices. They consider the proposals as subterfuges by the
                            American companies to obtain a foothold in the economy. After the facade
                            and rationalizations are stripped away, the basic reasons for the
                            negative decision is clearly exposed, fear of competition.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. Otabe indicated so well, Studebaker would be very serious
                            competition for the local industry, and how right he is! And how
                            salutary it would be for Japan’s position in world markets if it were
                            more competitive. Of course, the <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>
                            officials are correct when they say that, if the Studebaker case were
                            approved, other American and perhaps foreign companies may ask for the
                            same treatment, and <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> would be hard
                            put to deny such requests. This is further evidence that the evaluation
                            of private foreign investment is not made in terms of the beneficial
                            effects to the economy of Japan and its balance-of-payments position, as
                            stipulated in the Foreign Investment Law, but rather on the basis of its
                            effect on the competitive position of domestic producers and the degree
                            of ownership or control exercised by foreigners.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the reference telegram, the Ambassador plans to discuss
                            this matter in most serious terms with the Foreign Minister. He intends
                            to impress upon him that the United States Government considers this
                            matter of prime importance, not only because it adversely affects our
                            interests, but also that it is inimical to Japan’s own self-interest. He
                            will stress that the restrictive attitude is contrary to the provisions
                            of Japan’s Foreign Investment Law and is in violation of the spirit and
                            the letter of the <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> Treaty. In
                            accordance with the Department’s permissive authorization, <pb xml:id="pg_1627" n="1627" facs="0571"/>a formal protest will be made
                            to the Japanese Government under Article VII of that Treaty, unless
                            there is a discernible improvement in the investment climate in the near
                            future.</p>

                            controls down to China Committee level since items involved are already

                            Japan was promised multilateral treatment in due course and time has
                            come to fulfill that promise. Japan has waited 20 months for Korean
                            settlement and for China Committee to act. Believe we should now say to
                            Japan that, as far as US is concerned, Japan’s international commitments
                            re China trade are no greater than those of other members of Paris

                            promote Japanese support for US positions in forthcoming meetings or
                            thereafter. Embassy suggests only reservation to termination of

                        <p>Meanwhile, accelerated release from list of 400 and items deleted from US
                            security lists should be permitted. If Washington continues to believe
                            some 15 percent from “400” list should be held for possible proposal to
                            China Committee. Embassy urges short-term deadline be specified for
                            China Committee action. Further prolonged postponement of date when
                            Japanese Government will be able to announce that China controls have
                            been reduced to multilateral level is likely to generate unfortunate
                            repercussions that would be much too high a price to pay for continued
                            embargo by Japan of items which China is able to obtain from other China

                            is planning to take in the current fiscal year. I should like to refer

                        <p>4. Japan will make arrangements as soon as possible for effective
                            combined planning by its defense forces with the United States armed
                            forces in Japan.</p>

                        <p>I should also like to propose that our representatives meet at an early

                                as set forth above, but added that the Japanese Government would
                                have to seek enabling legislation and budgetary appropriations and,

                            importance.</p>
                        <p>Purpose US proposal is (a) enable Japan meet political pressures for

                            underway. While necessary for Japanese Government indicate that another
                            step has been taken in direction bringing Japanese controls into
                            conformity with multilateral controls, highly desirable no attempt be
                            made by Japanese Government dramatize accelerated removal of items from
                            embargo as new policy or as indication Japan no longer recognizes need
                            for multilateral cooperation in maintenance controls on China trade. Our
                            hope is that Japanese handling of decontrol would so closely resemble
                            disciplined decontrol procedure followed in past six months that could
                            not be regarded by Chinese Communists as evidence inability countries of
                            free world continue maintain high level controls on strategic trade with
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Department defers to Embassy judgment that it is unwise to condition
                            proposal for cancellation bilateral upon Japanese undertakings support
                            US other trade control matters. But US proposals will demonstrate
                            willingness US to cooperate with Japan on realignment Japanese controls
                            and will enable Japanese ease political pressures for reduction Japanese
                            controls to multilateral level. Consequently Embassy requested

                                    12, the Embassy, after reviewing the medical situation,
                                    concluded:</p>
                                <p>“We doubt, however, as situation now stands and after successive
                                    representations to Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, that our
                                    further preachments for cooperation will produce more than
                                    limited sharing of Japanese medical investigations. If an
                                    accurate knowledge true condition patient are sufficiently
                                    important to our national health interests to make denial of
                                    direct US access matter of grave concern, we shall probably have
                                    to move to some form or other of coercion and sanctions. This
                                    will require major effort in view emotionalism that surrounds
                                    subject here, weakness of government, entrenched position of
                                    government scientists and bureaucrats, and jingoistic
                                    sensationalism of press. We doubt that threat to withhold
                                    compensation would be enough, but if we go in with something
                                    more severe, we should be prepared to see it through. Under
                                    these circumstances and as Department has left timing to me, I

                                Japanese controls on trade with Communist China.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>On March 19, 1954, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, while making
                            no change in general US policy regarding controls on trade with
                            Communist China, decided that the US should release Japan “gradually, as
                            appropriate” from its obligation under the US-Japanese bilateral
                            agreement to maintain controls on exports to Communist China higher than
                            the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> level. The difference
                            between the multilateral level of controls on trade with Communist China
                            and the level maintained by Japan under the bilateral is composed of two
                            categories of items. The first category consists of items which the
                            Japanese agreed to embargo to Communist China because the United States
                            prohibits or controls quantitatively their export to Eastern Europe,
                            although they are not controlled by our Allies under multilateral
                            agreement. The second category is the special list of “400” items which
                            the Japanese agreed to embargo pending mutual determination on whether
                            the items should be considered strategic.</p>
                        <p>The two categories of items covered under the bilateral are much less
                            significant than they once were. Some of the items have in the past two
                            years been adopted by <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> for
                            multilateral control. Over 100 of the items on the “400” list have, in
                            the past seven months, been determined by the United States to be
                            non-strategic, and have been removed from embargo by the Japanese. But
                            the most important development has been the decision of the United
                            States, as a result of a review of its security lists, to permit
                            shipment of a large number of items to Eastern Europe. The deletion of
                            these items from US security lists not only sharply reduces the number
                            of items covered under the first category of the bilateral but also
                            undermines the justification for the retention of the less important
                            items covered under the second category of the bilateral. Although the
                            United States is obligated to notify the Japanese promptly of items
                            removed from the first category of the bilateral, there are 183 such
                            items on which no notification has yet been <pb xml:id="pg_1635" n="1635" facs="0579"/>given to the Japanese. Since the Japanese
                            Government is pressing the United States for agreement to drop 127 items
                            there can be little doubt that it would use its legal right to remove
                            all of these 183 items from the embargo list immediately upon such
                            notification.</p>
                        <p>In implementing the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decision we have
                            kept the following objectives in mind: (1) the need for easing political
                            pressures in Japan; (2) the desirability of securing Japanese
                            cooperation in maintaining multilateral controls; and (3) the avoidance
                            of any adverse effects on the Geneva conference. In telegram 2229 to the
                            Embassy of April 8, the Embassy was authorized to inform the Japanese
                            that the United States was prepared to cancel the bilateral subject to
                            assurances that the Japanese would spread the removal of items from
                            embargo over a period of at least three months and that the Japanese
                            would minimize publicity concerning their reduction of controls. We
                            asked the Embassy at the time it presented our proposal to the Japanese
                            to seek their cooperation in maintaining a high level of multilateral
                            controls. We also cautioned that if there were any deterioration in the
                            Far East situation we would depend upon Japan and our other Allies to
                            tighten their controls.</p>
                        <p>The gradual reduction of Japanese controls to the multilateral level over
                            the next three months will help us to secure wider support from Japan
                            for the maintenance of a high level of multilateral controls against
                            Communist China. The Embassy has estimated that the increase in Japanese
                            exports to Communist China as a result of reduction of Japanese controls
                            to the multilateral level will not be greater than $25 million a year. A
                            reduction in Japanese controls has been going on for seven months. While
                            this reduction will now proceed at an accelerated rate it can be
                            explained as a continuation of the Japanese policy of re-examining items
                            which Japan embargoes above the multilateral level for the purpose of
                            removing them if they are considered not to be of strategic
                            importance.</p>

                            asked but thought possibility worth exploring. Tsuchiya promised to do
                            his best and would communicate results his efforts two or three days. He

                            intervention probably not extemporaneous. Formula of single lump-sum
                            would obviate litigiousness of interim claim as now formulated and would
                            avoid precedent for indirect damages to fishing industry which might
                            establish basis for extensive and continuing liability in Japan and
                            elsewhere. We would, of course, probably wish to indicate in any public

                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary: While you were in Berlin, the National Security
                            Council discussed the proposed Revised Directive for the U.S. Civil
                            Administration of the Ryukyu Islands. Since there were certain aspects
                            of the proposed directive still unresolved between our departments, and
                            in recognition of your previously expressed personal interest in this
                            matter, the President decided to defer further consideration until your
                            return. More specifically, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action
                            No. 1047, resulting from its meeting of 17 February 1954 on the subject,
                            reads as follows:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>“a. Discussed the draft directive on the subject prepared by the
                                Departments of State and Defense and transmitted by the reference
                                memorandum of February 16, 1954.”</item>
                            <item>“b. Noted that the President would make a final decision regarding
                                the draft directive after further discussion with the Secretary of
                                State and Defense.”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Since this question remains unresolved, it has been impossible for this
                            Department to issue what is felt to be much needed revision <pb xml:id="pg_1638" n="1638" facs="0582"/>of the current directive. It
                            is my view that the proposed directive agreed upon by representatives of
                            the Departments of State and Defense at a meeting on 15 February 1954
                            should be issued. In order that the civil administration in the Ryukyu
                            Islands may be facilitated, it is hoped that the Departments of State
                            and Defense may be able to arrange for a discussion with the President
                            in the near future so that a final decision may be made.<note n="2" xml:id="d758fn2">

                            fishermen is being handled in Japan. The low point in Japanese medical
                            hostility came with the last report<note n="1" xml:id="d759fn1">Telegram
                                2574 from Tokyo, Apr. 21, not printed. (711.5611/4–2154)</note> in
                            which certain Japanese doctors had said that they had asked for
                            assistance but had received no reply. Actually, the best American
                            assistance available had been offered. Dr. Morton and Mr. Eisenbud had
                            gone to Tokyo, but since their assistance was not used and the
                            information they could have <pb xml:id="pg_1639" n="1639" facs="0583"/>provided was apparently not required, they had left. However, they had
                            emphasized that the offer for assistance still holds good. The Acting
                            Secretary said that it would be extremely unfortunate if anything should
                            mar the harmony in the relations between the U.S. and Japan, especially
                            at this time as we approach a conference when the Communists will
                            undoubtedly make every fantastic charge they can think of. He requested
                            the Ambassador to convey to his Government our concern, and said he felt
                            he must protest in the most friendly way possible the statement made by
                            the Japanese doctors.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> said that there
                            was some feeling in Japan that Dr. Morton was not as sympathetic in the
                            treatment of patients as he might have been in his work at Hiroshima.
                            When he saw the injured fishermen he expressed no word of consolation to
                            them. However, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName>
                            said he did not want to offer excuses. He had sent a telegram to his

                            would just let us know. He hoped that a pattern of cooperation could be
                            developed, particularly since we are both anxious that nothing should
                            happen which might interfere with a successful trip to the United States

                            appropriation, which would probably mean that even presently existing
                            capacity will not be utilized. This is most inauspicious prospect for

                        <p>We realize Japan will have to carry increasing part of burden of defense

                        <p>When Howard Sheperd, Chairman of Board of National City Bank, was in
                            Tokyo last week, he told me bank was being informally approached by
                            Japanese with view to opening line of credit in US during <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s visit. In response to his
                            query I said my initial reaction was unfavorable for two reasons:</p>
                        <p>In the first place, I felt timing was wrong and that if Japanese believed
                            they could get substantial loan or line of credit from United States it
                            would delay their taking necessary steps on their part to shore up
                            present precarious economic situation. I admitted that even if Japanese
                            should take all possible steps of their own it would probably still be
                            necessary for them to receive some economic and financial aid from US
                            but my present opinion was that in Japan’s own long-run interest America
                            should at this time be hard boiled.</p>
                        <p>In second place, I expressed opinion that grant of loan to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> at this time when he has just
                            surmounted one political crisis and while political situation still
                            unstable might well backfire. If loan granted, opposition could claim
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> was being “bought” by
                            America and that under such circumstances, retention of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> in power would only mean
                            continued servile subservience of Japanese Government to United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Sheperd told me he thought my points were well taken and he would caution
                            his people to be careful in any talks that might take place. Japanese
                            Vice President Johnson of National City Bank has just come in to tell me
                            that on afternoon prior to Sheperd’s departure, he had had interview
                            with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and Suzuki of Finance
                            Ministry in which Japanese put forward request for line of credit in
                            neighborhood of $150 million. According to Johnson, Mr. Sheperd advanced
                            as his own two opinions given above and asked specifically whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> did not agree that grant
                            of loan to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> at this time
                            might backfire. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> is reported
                            to have replied that on contrary, if <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> did not come back with something it would be
                            final and fatal blow to him and Liberal Party. Everyone would say that
                            in spite of all <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had done
                            to cooperate with United States he could not even obtain any sort of
                            loan. I pointed out to Johnson that in many respects Japanese
                            cooperation with United States, in economic as well as other matters,
                            left considerable to be desired and that I still was of the opinion
                            timing was not ripe for grant of such line of credit. Johnson said
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> indicated that Japanese
                            would be satisfied with strict conditions being placed on line of credit
                            and would expect to have to justify thoroughly individual projects
                            before money would be forthcoming. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> claimed that for every million dollars Japan
                            received it would be necessary to use 25 to 50 million yen and that
                            therefore it was not likely that there would be any sudden influx of
                            dollars into Japanese economy. Sheperd told <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> that he did not wish to make any decision at that
                                <pb xml:id="pg_1642" n="1642" facs="0586"/>time as to whether or not
                            private American banks would look with favor in granting credit to Japan
                            but said that in any case this would not be done unless the banks knew
                            they had approval of American Embassy in Tokyo and United States
                            Government. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> stated that
                            Japanese did not wish to approach Embassy at this time but rather
                            desired to obtain informal reaction of American bankers. If this was
                            negative, Japanese would then drop matter and would endeavor to make
                            clear that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s trip was only
                            “good will” tour without any expectation of conducting important
                            negotiations. Sheperd reserved comment but, according to Johnson, cabled
                            factual report of meeting to his head office.</p>
                        <p>In addition to what I had previously said, I told Johnson confidentially
                            that I was reinforced in my opinions as result of conversations with
                            Italian Ambassador here who has just recently returned from Rome.
                            Ambassador told me that American aid to Italy, in his opinion, had
                            effect of “dope” on Italians and because it had been given too freely
                            and without sufficient conditions attached prevented Italians themselves
                            from getting down to business and doing what they should have done to
                            improve their own situation. This had played into hands of left wing and
                            Communists in Italy according to D’Ajeta. Johnson agreed that there was
                            danger in giving too much too soon but pointed out that if we waited too
                            long Japan might get into such critical economic situation that it would
                            cost far more to bring her back.</p>
                        <p>Do not yet have any final recommendations on this matter but in view of
                            fact that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> has said he

                        <p>1. End of 1954 Pacific nuclear tests gives us opportunity for first
                            assessment import <hi rend="italic">Fukuryu Maru</hi> incident for
                            US-Japan relations. Full implications may not be known for years but
                            certain conclusions of critical import to US policies are now
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>2. Conclusions are unpleasant, some even ominous. However, espionage or
                            provocation by vessel or crew do not seem be in picture. No intelligence

                        <p>4. This was psychological and political background for <hi rend="italic">Fukuryu Maru</hi> incident. When new pressures of Japan’s exposure
                            to “ashes of death” were added, government and people cracked. Period of
                            uncontrolled masochism ensued, as nation aided by unscrupulous press,
                            seemed to revel in fancied martyrdom, and US-Japanese cooperation broke
                            down. For a time, on <hi rend="italic">Fukuryu Maru</hi> incident,
                            government in Japan ceased to govern.</p>
                        <p>5. Breakdown was triggered by small group Japanese scientists and
                            doctors, many of whom were fuzzy-minded leftists, pacifists,
                            neutralists. Nearly all seemed animated by resentments arising from
                            occupation with its ban on Japanese atomic research; by hostility toward
                            ABCC and its <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>-founded
                            correspondent, the National Institute of Health; by sense of outrage
                            over purges in medical and scientific field. All of them had vistas of
                            nation-wide publicity at home and world-wide scientific prominence as
                            exclusive proprietors of world’s first hydrogen-bomb patients.</p>

                            uncontrolled statements and releases made more lurid by sensationalist
                            press. Then Communist and pacifist and neutralist agitation and
                            propaganda apparatus moved into situation that was made to order for
                            them to (a) alienate Japan from US; (b) derive nuclear intelligence; (c)
                            pose as champions of Asian racialism; (d) attempt delay or have

                            complaints turned from mere sensationalism to avalanche of abuse against
                            US. American doctors were vilified; US offers of assistance portrayed as
                            attempts to conceal evidence or minimize injury to Japan; Embassy
                            expressions of regret over incident denounced as either belated or
                            insufficiently effusive. National responses to combined exertions
                            Communists, scientists, and press irresponsibility were immediate and
                            overpowering. The most senior levels of the government under incessant

                                reporters and photographers were freely allowed aboard. Samples of

                                Prime Minister to Cabinet and from Ministers to staff were flouted;
                                formal commitments to US were ignored. Government suffered and
                                accepted series humiliating retreats. Over opposition of Welfare and
                                Education Ministries bureaucrats, government was unable comply with
                                successive Embassy requests; (i) to turn <hi rend="italic">Fukuryu

                                made at Cabinet level for them to visit patients were refused by

                                government doctors or to restrain slanderous attacks on US but it
                                was also unable have its own statements and corrections published.

                                unreported, as did subsequent press conference by Minister

                                strenuous in these instances, for we know of no previous case in

                                What must now be recognized is depth of Japanese fear of nuclear
                                weapons, their conviction of doom in event of war, and, as
                                consequences their readiness to panic and their intense gullibility
                                in nuclear matters. Throughout past eight weeks, no report of
                                long-range air or sea contamination, no story of food or water
                                pollution, no theory of genetic deterioration seemed too wild for
                                acceptance. To unlimited targets of opportunity in Japan, to total
                                lack of civilian defense organization must now be added this
                                dangerous psychological vulnerability of Japanese to weapons and
                                devices of nuclear technology. If Communists understand this latter
                                element, and there is no reason to believe it has escaped their
                                attention, the consequences for our military planning with respect
                                to Japan could be extremely grave. In the event of war or an
                                imminent threat, if Communists astutely manage and carefully prepare
                                a psychological-military operation involving threat of nuclear
                                weapons against Japan, this might well on basis present record

                            of this. Furthermore, press has begun to call on government to exact

                            that US could bring nuclear weapons into Japan without informing

                            on this we still await Japanese response to our compensation formula.
                            With compensation settlement and end 1954 series much of sensationalism
                            surrounding incident should disappear. It will be to Japanese interest
                            to close out or explain away administrative deficiencies and national
                            vulnerabilities incident has illuminated. It is probable that short of
                            imminent threat of war in Far East, point of our greatest dependence on
                            Japan, we shall not again be shown so sharply lack of Japanese domestic
                            security, absence of effective control over bureaucratic apparatus,
                            paralysis of government in information field, and desire to pull free of
                            US and other foreigners. Strength of Japanese neutralism and
                            isolationism may more often be evident.</p>
                        <p>9. Remedies for these weaknesses must be sought in development stronger,
                            tougher-minded Japanese Government and in recovery of people from
                            postwar psychosis. But a regime fortified with increasingly centralized
                            security and information controls, indispensable as such a development
                            is on present evidence, would not of itself be enough. It is highly
                            questionable whether stronger Japanese Government had it existed in
                            March 1954 would have produced different national response to <hi rend="italic">Fukuryu Maru</hi>. Panic might have been more
                            controlled; hysteria might have been more managed and purposeful. We
                            might more quickly have arrived at present dead center where government
                            seems to be letting matter ride. Specific actions it could now take, if
                            it desired to bring incident to speedy close, would be to provide us
                            with complete clinical reports re patients, to submit lump-sum
                            compensation estimate, to control utterances of at least senior
                            personnel. Failure take any these steps is at this date probably
                            attributable more to lack of willingness than to lack of capability. And
                            this reluctance in turn would seem derive from desire extract some
                            advantage from uncontrolled panic of March and April in terms stronger
                            bargaining position re Japan’s role in Far East collective action system
                            or revision of security treaty. Also government not unmindful political
                            advantages demonstrating independence from US.</p>
                        <p>10. In these matters whether we deal with strong or weak government in
                            Japan we are involved in heart of problem of Japan’s national survival
                            in nuclear age. Neutralism in Japan will vary in direct proportion to
                            conclusion Japanese leaders reach as to whether relationship with US can
                            provide, more than any other course of Japanese action, defense and
                            security in period when both US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> possess thermonuclear weapons. Ultimate significance
                            of <hi rend="italic">Fukuryu Maru</hi> incident will thus be first
                            whether we can devise a defense <pb xml:id="pg_1648" n="1648" facs="0592"/>strategy for Japan’s security in light enormous new
                            complications that 1954 thermonuclear test series has established and

                        <p>11. Many of conclusions above patently serious. This, of course, does not
                            of itself mean we should draw in our lines but rather that certain
                            realities with which we have to live are now more apparent. I look

                        </list>
                        <p>The Bikini accident of March 1 spotlighted the following major facts and
                            implications to the United States of the situation in Japan:</p>
                        <p>1. The present <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government
                            is not at all times able to control its own bureaucracy. We doubt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> will remain much
                            longer as Prime Minister and he may retire after his world trip in June
                            and July. However, the trend in Japan is toward a more powerful grouping
                            of the dominant conservative forces and a <pb xml:id="pg_1649" n="1649" facs="0593"/>more effective government. This is a problem which the
                            Japanese must solve for themselves.</p>
                        <p>2. International problems, particularly Japan’s mounting foreign exchange
                            crisis, the strong role being taken by Red China, Russia’s thermonuclear
                            capability, and Indochina, cause the Japanese Government and people
                            concern over the value of their political and security ties to the
                            United States. We expect to discuss these matters with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> here in June and believe it
                            would help if you personally would assure him of our determination to
                            hold the line in Asia and as necessary to help Japan in its economic
                            troubles.</p>
                        <p>3. The Japanese are pathologically sensitive about nuclear weapons. They
                            feel they are the chosen victims of such weapons. We are doing several
                            things to meet this situation:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. <hi rend="italic">Compensation</hi>. Embassy Tokyo feels this
                                is the most important specific issue to dispose of. We have publicly
                                announced we would compensate the injured fishermen and we have
                                suggested to the Japanese Government the sum of $150,000. Any agreed
                                figure would probably require Congressional appropriation. There are
                                several difficulties: we have not been permitted to examine the
                                fishermen; the Japanese will probably claim heavy damages of an
                                indirect type such as for fish thrown away and lost profits. We feel
                                we should be prepared to raise our initial figure, perhaps to
                                $300,000, to avoid legalistic haggling and gain rapid agreement. We
                                should then pay promptly.</item>
                            <item>b. <hi rend="italic">Exchange of Information</hi>. With the
                                cooperation of <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> we have
                                transmitted to the Japanese scientific information on radioactivity.
                                In conjunction with <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> we have
                                several exchange projects in process. We feel that in the long run
                                scientific interchange is the best remedy for Japanese emotion and
                                ignorance and we intend to push such projects.</item>
                            <item>c. <hi rend="italic">
                                    <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>

                                incident and our desire to assist, and to give these statements wide
                                publicity. We also plan to tell <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> we had hoped for more effective cooperation
                                by subordinate Japanese officials, for more effective public
                                information activities by the Japanese Government, and for better
                                security measures. We think these improvements are likely in time
                                and will go far to combat neutralism and apathy in Japan.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>4. Effective defense of Japan will be very difficult until the Japanese
                            assume a fair load themselves and until they understand their stake in
                            the struggle against Communist tyranny. We are trying to prod them into
                            doing more and are giving them very substantial military assistance. The
                            most important thing that we can do to help is to treat Japan as a full,
                            free-world partner and bring her as much as possible into our own and
                            free world counsels. This is essential if we are to count upon the use
                            of Japanese bases and other cooperation in any future conflict. We
                            recommend regular high-level consultations with the Japanese on
                            politico-military problems.</p>

                        <p>5. Japan’s economic problem is becoming increasingly serious. Things we
                            should do to help solve it include:</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">John</persName>: At today’s meeting of
                            the Consultative Group, General Magruder<note n="2" xml:id="d764fn2">Lt.
                                Gen. Carter B. Magruder, USA, Chief of Staff, Far East
                                Command.</note> expressed his personal view that the present
                            situation in Washington with respect to defense appropriations and
                            defense production make our policy of promoting the re-establishment of
                            Japan’s defense industries out of date. It was my impression that
                            General Magruder was speaking on the basis of his background in the
                            Pentagon, which he left some eight months ago, rather than on
                            instructions from the Defense Department.</p>
                        <p>General Magruder pointed out that the policy to develop the Japanese
                            mobilization base was originally formulated in the expectation of
                            imminent war with Russia and as a result of the then inadequacy of the
                            U.S. mobilization base. While the policy is still on the books,
                            developments over the past few years make it no longer valid. In the
                            first place, the U.S. mobilization potential has been greatly increased
                            and there is no longer any urgency about developing defense facilities
                            outside the U.S. Furthermore, with the present cut-backs in American
                            defense production, there is no justification now for expending funds to
                            promote a defense production base in Japan. General Magruder pointed to
                            one other factor which, in his view, argued against the likelihood of an
                            effective program to promote development of Japanese defense production.
                            The U.S. program for promoting Japanese defense production was based on
                            a 10–division force, for which the U.S. would place in Japan the initial
                            orders for much of the original equipment with the thought that the
                            Japanese would then take over the procurement <pb xml:id="pg_1651" n="1651" facs="0595"/>of equipment from the Japanese plants.
                            However, the Japanese were unwilling to build up the defense forces to
                            such levels and to make any large appropriations for material and
                            equipment for their forces. Therefore, the only way to stimulate
                            Japanese defense production would be through placement of U.S. orders
                            for end items. Defense appropriations projected for U.S. fiscal year
                            1955 do not envisage any such large-scale procurement in Japan, and, in
                            the present mood of Congress, it would be virtually impossible to
                            justify further appropriations to stimulate Japanese defense production
                            unless the Japanese show they are willing to build up their forces and
                            expend far larger sums for defense.</p>
                        <p>In sum, General Magruder confirms the Embassy’s impression that the
                            prospective volume of U.S. contract awards in Japan will not be
                            sufficient to permit an appreciable development of Japan’s mobilization
                            base. He said that the military would continue to explore every
                            possibility for offshore procurement here and that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> had recently addressed letters to the
                            three services along this line. Nevertheless, he feels, as we do, that
                            special dollar receipts will continue to decline and that Japan for
                            balance of payments purposes can not rely on any upturn in such receipts
                            in the absence of large-scale hostilities in which the U.S. is
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>I thought General Magruder’s remarks worth passing to you at once in view
                            of the several points that were novel, if depressing, to all of us. I’m
                            afraid he is correct in his judgment.</p>

                        <p>1. Informal negotiations have begun in Tokyo for settlement of Japanese
                            claims arising from the recent United States nuclear test series in the
                            Pacific. With the Department’s approval the Embassy tentatively proposed
                            to the Foreign Office a settlement of $150,000.</p>
                        <p>2. The Foreign Office has now informally replied that the United States
                            figure is too low and has estimated total damage to Japan at slightly
                            over 7 million dollars. Of this total about $800,000 would be for direct
                            damage and the remainder would be for loss of profits, <pb xml:id="pg_1652" n="1652" facs="0596"/>depressed prices, and
                            governmental expenditures. Attached at Tab A is Tokyo’s 2954<note n="1" xml:id="d765fn1">Dated May 29, not printed. (211.9441/5–2954)</note>

                        <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> considers
                            the problem as primarily political and not legal. He has discussed the
                            problem with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and recommends that he be authorized to
                            negotiate for settlement at a figure between $500,000 and one million
                            dollars. The Ambassador considers that <hi rend="italic">ex gratia</hi>
                            payment of about $800,000 (300 million yen) should not be ruled out and
                            that even if negotiations should be conducted on a legal basis this is
                            the figure the Japanese Government would probably maintain with
                            considerable rigidity. Attached at Tab B is Tokyo’s 2960<note n="2" xml:id="d765fn2">Dated May 31, not printed. (211.9441/5–3154)</note>

                            of this matter in United States–Japan relations, compensation settlement
                            of as much as one million dollars would not be unreasonable.</p>
                        <p>5. A and H are of the opinion this problem should be informally discussed
                            with appropriate members of both appropriations committees and both
                            foreign affairs committees of the Congress in order to explain the

                            million dollars. Upon the basis of this understanding further
                            negotiations could then be carried on in Tokyo.<note n="4" xml:id="d765fn4">

                                    We won’t know until tonight or tomorrow. The Sec. asked what was
                                    behind it. A. said the Socialists are being difficult about the

                            situation while not at all alarming required him to stay here until
                            Parliamentary Government had been established on a firm basis. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> felt that at all costs
                            a repetition of the disturbances of two nights ago must be avoided. If
                            at some time in the future the Prime Minister should decide to make the
                            trip, he would be sure to give us ample notice of his intentions. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK2">Okumura</persName> then offered the
                            sincere apologies of his government for any difficulties caused in
                            Washington and expressed regret that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> had been so inconvenienced. I
                            told <persName corresp="#p_OK2">Okumura</persName> I was sure my

                            apologies. I thought that there might well be feeling of relief in
                            Washington at indefinite postponement as it might have been most
                            difficult to make revised plans for later this month. <persName corresp="#p_OK2">Okumura</persName> said Prime Minister was meeting
                            with Liberal Party leaders this morning preparatory to moving ten-day
                            extension of Diet session later today. Chief Cabinet Secretary

                                an accelerated release of Class B and C war criminals, the

                                effectively is bound to cause our broader interests here to suffer

                                Japanese of issue which they can exploit when it suits their
                                purpose.” (694.0026/5–2154)</note> that a large bloc of Japanese war
                            criminals be immediately released. Only those who committed the most
                            heinous crimes would be left in Sugamo. This, of course, applies only to
                            the 293 war criminals convicted by United States courts.</p>

                            of February 16, 1954<note n="2" xml:id="d767fn2">For Dunning’s

                        <p>Expediting release of war criminals is not anticipated by the Parole and
                            Clemency Board because of the serious nature of the crimes committed by
                            the 293 war criminals convicted by the United States. 145 of these have
                            life sentences and 30 have sentences of over 30 years. The fact that the
                            President recently disapproved 4 recommendations by the Board for parole
                            reflects his strong feelings and acts as a deterrent to more rapid
                            action by the Board. The Board is, however, considering a change in its
                            rules whereby all prisoners would be eligible for parole after serving
                            10 years. This would mean that most of the war criminals would be
                            eligible for release in 1955–56 rather than some years later as would
                            now appear to be the case. HICOG’s views regarding this <pb xml:id="pg_1655" n="1655" facs="0599"/>change in rules is now being
                            sought. To cut through this morass of legal and technical problems I
                            think an approach based on overriding political considerations is
                            required.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. The continued incarceration of a large number of Japanese war
                                criminals is hardly consistent with United States policies of
                                dealing with Japan as a sovereign and responsible ally and
                                constitutes a continuing source of friction between this government
                                and Japan.</item>
                            <item>2. This issue creates a psychological resistance among the
                                Japanese to full cooperation with the United States on defense
                                measures and other questions. It is a major obstacle to Japanese
                                rearmament.</item>
                            <item>3. While a number of problems involving Japan are beyond
                                resolution by the United States alone, i.e., Japanese-Korean
                                relations, Japanese relations with Southeast Asia etc., this
                                question is one on which the United States can take constructive
                                action without cost to the United States.</item>
                            <item>4. The grant of amnesty by the Philippines and China places the
                                United States and other “white powers’’ in an embarrassing and
                                anomalous position.</item>
                            <item>5. The Japanese do not understand western concepts of law. They
                                consider the Communists equally guilty of war crimes, but see these
                                persons go unpunished while Japanese war criminals remain
                                incarcerated.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you stress the above considerations to the appropriate
                            officials and that you propose:</p>
                        <p>1. Immediate release of Japanese war criminals not necessarily on the
                            basis of amnesty, excluding perhaps a few guilty of the most heinous
                            crimes.</p>
                        <p>2. In the alternative, expeditious release by shortening the period for
                            eligibility for parole perhaps to 8 or 9 years, of most of the war
                            criminals. This could enable substantial numbers to be released in 1954
                            and 1955. I think that by the end of 1955 all but a very few should be
                                released.<note n="3" xml:id="d767fn3">No record of any

                                held the post of Finance Minister from February 1949 to October
                                1952.</note> stated that he had just come from a long conference
                            with the Prime Minister, who was determined to remain in power even if
                            it became necessary to sacrifice a coalition of all Liberal forces.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said he had gone to the
                            Prime Minister determined to recommend his retirement, but found him so
                            adamant and confident regarding the retention of power that he dared not
                            broach the subject. He remarked, “If a man of 74, 20 years my senior,
                            has the will to fight and is confident of victory, I could scarcely
                            advise him to surrender.” Although the remark was made as a commonplace
                            observation, it reveals the Japanese respect for age and the degree to
                            which the country is subject to seniority rule.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> next commented that he
                            would have to leave the luncheon to attend a meeting of the Conservative
                            forces at 2:00 P.M. The conferees, he explained, had already agreed on a
                            platform. The current meeting would determine the voting procedure by
                            which the President of the new Conservative Party (which it is hoped
                            will be constituted) will be selected. The forces opposed to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> advocated a ballot in
                            which each member of the party would record his first, second, and third
                            choice; the candidate receiving the largest total number of votes would
                            be designated President. The <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> forces favored a single ballot, in the belief
                            that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> would be able to
                            capture a majority of the total vote. The opposition were of the opinion
                            that under their plan Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName>
                            would be the successful candidate; in fact, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> stated as general <pb xml:id="pg_1657" n="1657" facs="0601"/>knowledge that Oasa,
                            political advisor to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>,
                            had conferred yesterday with <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> and had agreed on a slate of <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> for President and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> for Vice-President. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> estimated that among the
                            Conservative forces in the Diet, ⅓ favored <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, ⅓ <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>, and ⅓ were undetermined. From this latter
                            group, the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> forces hoped to
                            obtain sufficient votes to give their candidate a majority.<note n="3" xml:id="d768fn3">A single Conservative Party was not formed at this

                        </p>
                        <p>It is Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s desire to unite
                            the Conservative forces in the Diet under his leadership, if that is
                            possible. Should he be unable to accomplish this objective, then he
                            would attempt to attract as many Progressives as would join a revised
                            Liberal Party under his leadership, in the hope of obtaining a firm
                            majority in the Diet. Once this is accomplished, he would feel free to
                            embark upon his delayed world tour, possibly in August. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> remarked that, under such
                            circumstances, he would accompany the Prime Minister, explaining that
                            all of his personal and party transactions had been audited and that as
                            a result he had been completely cleared by the procurator of recent
                            charges. When the Prime Minister returned from his trip, with an
                            anticipated enhancement of prestige, he believed it might be a strategic
                            time to dissolve the Diet and go to the country in an election, with the
                            objective of obtaining an even more solid Conservative base. With this
                            accomplished, he could then, after a brief rule, retire as an elder
                            statesman, feeling that he had made the maximum possible effort toward
                            the constitution of democracy in Japan on a firm foundation.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> commented that he had found
                            the Prime Minister severely troubled by the grave economic problems that
                            faced Japan. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> was worried
                            regarding the policy of deflation now being pursued and its ultimate
                            effect upon business and employment. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> advised the Prime Minister that the policy, even
                            though painful, must be pursued; that, while business failures and
                            unemployment might result temporarily, it was essential to check the
                            inflationary forces in the Japanese economy and to bring about an
                            improvement in the competitive position of Japanese goods in world
                            markets, as well as the position of the yen in world trade. He also
                            remarked that the Prime Minister could not expect to receive a
                            sympathetic hearing abroad unless he was pursuing a rigorous fiscal and
                            credit policy at home. In response to a statement that one basic need of
                            Japan appeared to be increased efficiency in production and a reduction
                            in costs, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> replied that
                            modernization in industrial plant would require capital and that this
                            would necessitate <pb xml:id="pg_1658" n="1658" facs="0602"/>the
                            imposition of credit controls, which he favored and which might be
                            possible if the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> forces
                            obtained a Diet majority.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> was told that foreign
                            investment, if encouraged, could make a distinct contribution to the
                            strengthening of the Japanese economy and would accelerate the
                            introduction of new industrial plant and modern techniques of both
                            production and management. He replied that he had long favored the
                            introduction of foreign capital; in fact, he had been invited to
                            accompany the Prime Minister on his ill-fated world tour in June, but
                            had refused, stating that he could not visit the United States because
                            he had been unable to keep his promise to liberalize the provisions for
                            the entry of foreign capital. The new and strengthened Conservative
                            forces under <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> would, if
                            they materialize, enact appropriate legislation. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> himself proposed a merger of the
                            foreign exchange control law and the foreign investment law with a view
                            to liberalizing the provisions of both.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> went on to say that in
                            his conference with the Prime Minister the latter asked how he could
                            most effectively broach the subject of loans in the United States.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> advised against raising
                            the subject, arguing that it was premature until Japan had taken
                            appropriate steps on its own behalf. He urged instead that the Prime
                            Minister should seek to obtain from the United States assurances of
                            continued interest and support in this period of Japan’s economic
                            tribulation. He added that the Prime Minister might seek to obtain a
                            commitment from the United States to extend, should it prove necessary,
                            a line of credit for the purpose of a currency stabilization. This, he
                            argued, would restore confidence in the integrity of the yen, check
                            irresponsible rumors of devaluation, and enhance Japan’s trading
                            position.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Leader-Follower Relationship</p>
                        <p>In discussing the desire of the Japanese for basic assurances from the
                            United States, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> smiled and
                            said, “You realize that Japan has been a modern state for less than 100
                            years. It has been traditional in Japanese life for the people to look
                            for guidance, assistance, and support to some wealthy, influential
                            patron. The United States could exploit this attitude to our mutual
                            advantage.” He went on to explain that assumption of the role of
                            protector and advisor need not be costly. What the Japanese so
                            desperately desire is the assurance of someone strong enough to make it
                            meaningful. As a nation they seek the security which such assurance
                            would afford, just as individuals covet the support of an employer, a
                            political mentor, or a wealthy friend. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> observed that perhaps the United States was making
                            a mistake to treat Japan as a sovereign nation equal in strength and
                            importance to itself. Perhaps, he said, <pb xml:id="pg_1659" n="1659" facs="0603"/>it would be better if the relationship were that of a
                            teacher to his student. We commented that before the war the Japanese
                            had had the advantage of the British alliance and that this had been the
                            focal point for many years in determining their foreign policy. With
                            that relationship no longer in force, Japan was at sea without a rudder
                            and felt the urgent need of a substitute. In a rare burst of confidence,
                            he observed that the Oriental mind, philosophy, and attitude differed
                            from those of the west. He said the Oriental is patient; if something
                            cannot be accomplished immediately, perhaps it can in a hundred years,
                            whereas the American seeks action this minute, this hour, or this day.
                            He characterized Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            as an example of a typical American mind. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> went on to say, with a wry expression, that
                            perhaps the British were wiser and more skillful, even though often more
                            insolent and insulting, and observed that the United States appeared
                            frequently to have been used by the British to support their policies
                            and to accept the disapprobation therefrom.</p>
                        <p>It was obvious that <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> was
                            pleading for the understanding of the United States and the continuation
                            (with appropriate modifications) of the role of Shogun so admirably
                            filled during the years of occupation. He probably spoke for a majority
                            of the Japanese who would like to feel the comforting security of the
                            strength of the United States acting in the role of patron and mentor.
                            The traditional need of Japan for such a sponsor offers the United
                            States a unique opportunity.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> dated June 14. In it
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName> had reviewed
                                the arguments for an accelerated release of war criminals and
                                concluded: “I, therefore, suggest that you consider discussing with
                                the [Parole and Clemency] Board the development of a procedure
                                whereby (1) all prisoners would become eligible for parole after
                                serving 9 years and (2) all cases will be reviewed by the end of
                                1955 and recommendations made to the President with respect to all
                                but the most heinous cases.” (694.0026/6–1454)</note> proposing that
                            Japanese war <pb xml:id="pg_1660" n="1660" facs="0604"/>criminals be
                            eligible for parole after serving 9 years and that all cases be reviewed
                            and recommendations made to the President by the end of 1955 leaving
                            only a hard core incarcerated.</p>
                        <p>The General indicated that he did not believe the Board would accept the
                            9 year proposal but would recommend to the President that eligibility
                            for parole be set at 10 years in view of the fact that a round figure of
                            10 had some relationship to federal procedures while nine had nothing
                            but political considerations to justify it. I indicated that it was my
                            hope that the Board would see fit to accept the 9 year figure. He
                            pointed out this would make no major difference in that the Board by the
                            end of 1955 would have reviewed all the cases and have made
                            recommendations to the President in all instances except those involving
                            the most heinous crimes. If it appeared desirable to parole a person
                            even though he was not eligible automatically for parole, the Board
                            could always exercise clemency and reduce the sentence so as to make the
                            person eligible. He had no idea what number would constitute the final
                            hard core. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">Finn</persName> suggested a
                            two digit figure might look good. I ventured to guess that 25 might be
                            justified.</p>
                        <p>The General went on to say that the Army and Navy JAG’s would complete
                            their review of the cases by the end of 1954. In reply to a question
                            from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">Finn</persName>, the General
                            indicated that the Department did not review the cases because neither
                            the files nor the personnel were available. Later he pointed out to me
                            that the Embassy acted for the Department in reviewing the cases. The
                            General also pointed out that he performed the role of “advocator” of
                            clemency and parole in opposition to the more conservative views of the
                            Defense and Justice members. He noted that the Board maintained careful
                            records of the cases as considered in order to justify its and the
                            President’s decisions if ever their actions were challenged.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">Finn</persName> thinks that in view of
                            the curtain of legality surrounding all actions on war criminals,
                            continuing informal consultations with General <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> may be the most effective way for
                                <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> to make its views known. This
                            would of course be secondary to positive recommendations from the
                            Embassy.</p>

                            could not agree to assignment of an <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>
                            Minister to Tokyo until and unless my Deputy had equivalent rank.</p>
                        <p>However we cannot be placed in position of merely negative
                            obstructionism. I therefore suggested that Clarence Meyer (whom <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> wish to appoint as Mission Chief Tokyo)
                            be detailed to make detailed survey in cooperation with Embassy with
                            view to submitting recommendations in not more than three months as to
                            what can and should be done by US to aid Japan economically and what
                            type if any <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> mission is required.</p>
                        <p>I have long acquaintance with and highest regard for Meyer and believe
                            this is best solution at this time for our problem. Baldwin<note n="2" xml:id="d770fn2">Charles F. Baldwin, Economic Coordinator in the

                            spoke in high terms of <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName> and
                            expressed strong hope he would be able work with Meyer on survey and if
                                <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> mission should be decided on
                            that <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName> would accept Deputy’s
                            position. I expressed doubts that he could be persuaded but said I had
                            no objection <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> trying. I
                            think we do not yet need to cross that bridge but I wish you would
                            discuss whole matter frankly with <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName> and personally show him this message. If possible
                            for him to delay his departure six to eight weeks to assist in survey it
                            would be most helpful. (I realize how difficult <pb xml:id="pg_1662" n="1662" facs="0606"/>this will be.) <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> offered this morning to send <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName> to London, Paris and Spain at
                                <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> expense if it would help in
                            showing <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName> how <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> missions operate and perhaps persuade
                            him of importance and possibilities of Deputy position. Needless to say
                            whatever results of survey I should be most reluctant lose <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName>’s extremely valuable and
                            efficient services.</p>
                        <p>I understand Meyer would be available for survey almost immediately. I
                            shall wish discuss whole matter immediately on my return.</p>

                        <p>In <persName corresp="#p_MLA1">Minnich</persName>’s “Supplementary Notes”
                            on the Legislative Leadership Meeting held June 21, the section
                            concerning Japan reads:</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Japan</hi>—The President took note of the different
                            groups on the Hill which preached either ‘no trade with Red China’ or
                            ‘no war in Southeast Asia’ or ‘no further liberalization of trade’ or
                            even ‘no trade with Japan.’ It was his own feeling, however, that if we
                            didn’t do a little of some of these, we would lose Japan. Should Japan
                            go communist (in fact or in sympathy) the U.S. would be out of the
                            Pacific, and it would become a communist lake.</p>
                        <p>“The President thought something had to be done for Japan through the
                            Mutual Security program, or trade or otherwise; the U.S. just couldn’t
                            let the situation be dominated by the irresponsible groups that are
                            shouting on the Hill. We’ve got to steer a clear and steady course, he
                            said, with at least a modicum of sense in it.” (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, Staff Secretary’s

                        <p>The memorandum of a telephone call received by <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> from the President early in the
                            evening of June 22 reads: “The Pres. said he has to talk with editors
                            this evening and wondered about giving them something to clarify their
                            minds re the Western Pacific. He mentioned Japan with 85 million people,
                            the importance of trade, the importance of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> etc. to keep them in our orbit. He had talked about
                            Japan before some Congressmen. The Sec. said it sounded all right to
                            him.” (Memorandum prepared by Phyllis D. Bernau, <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> papers, “Telephone

                        <p>In his remarks later that evening before the National Editorial
                            Association the President outlined the problems faced by the United
                            States in determining the extent of its foreign aid, the degree to which
                            it was prepared to allow or agree to its allies’ trade with Communist
                            states, the degree to which it would become involved in Southeast Asia,
                            and the amount of trade it should itself engage in with countries with
                            lower labor and living standards. He continued:</p>
                        <p>“Well now, my friends, I want to take a situation in the world that
                            focuses all of these considerations and these facts upon one particular
                            problem that we have to solve. Over in the western Pacific, the key to
                            its defense is Japan. Japan comprises 85 million people—industrious,
                            hardworking, inventive. Actually, the power that they developed against
                            us in World War II was such as to be frightening when we saw what they
                            could do alone. Consequently, it becomes absolutely mandatory to us, and
                            to our safety, that the Japanese nation does not fall under the
                            domination of the Iron Curtain countries, or specifically the Kremlin.
                            If the Kremlin controls them, all of that great war-making capacity
                            would be turned against the free world. All of the soldiers, all of the
                            armies, all of the air force, they could use. Japan would be given the
                            task of producing all the great navies that they need. And the Pacific
                            would become a Communist lake.</p>
                        <p>“Now, my friends, what is Japan? Eighty-five million people, living on an
                            area no larger than California. Now we of course admit that California
                            is a very wonderful and prosperous place, but as yet there are not 85
                            million people there. And even if there were, they would have access to
                            all the markets of the United States on a free basis.</p>
                        <p>“Japan cannot live, and Japan cannot remain in the free world unless
                            something is done to allow her to make a living.</p>
                        <p>“Now, if we will not give her any money, if we will not trade with her,
                            if we will not allow her to trade with the Reds, if we will not try to
                            defend in any way the southeast Asian area where she has a partial trade
                            opportunity, what is to happen to Japan?</p>
                        <p>“It is going to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>“Now, no one of these programs pursued alone could possibly help Japan;
                            and any one of them pursued to an extreme would ruin us.”</p>

                            recommended to the President, 17 cases which the Board has acted on but
                            has not approved and 15 cases with respect to which the Japanese
                            Government has not to date submitted recommendations.</p>
                        <p>The nine year rule would have made the persons set forth in the table
                            above eligible for parole a year earlier. General <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> points out that 41 of the 70 to
                            become eligible in 1956 become eligible within the first four months of
                            that year.</p>
                        <p>The General also informed me that the Board on June 21, acted favorably
                            on seven cases. 11 of the Board’s recommendations are now before the
                            President, several for sometime, but action has not been taken by the
                            President. Four of these cases are lifers which involved a reduction of
                            sentence in order to make the prisoner eligible for parole.</p>
                        <p>The General indicated that the Board has accepted <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss>’s recommendation to review all cases before the end of
                            1955. The Board will continue to recommend reductions in sentence so far
                            as possible in order to bring the cases down to the hard core by the end
                            of 1955. In this way recommendations would be transmitted to the <pb xml:id="pg_1665" n="1665" facs="0609"/>President by the end of 1955
                            with respect to all prisoners except the hard core. General <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> indicates that it is impossible at
                            this time to predict what number will actually constitute the hard

                            by the United States at Bikini. After several days, some of the members
                            of the crew began to suffer from skin burns and were found upon arrival
                            in Japan to have been injured as a result of the nuclear test. The
                            United States has indicated to the Japanese Government its willingness
                            to provide compensation, without admission of any liability, for this
                            and other damage resulting from the Bikini incident. The State
                            Department has been conducting informal negotiations with the Japanese
                            Foreign Office. Japan has estimated total direct personal and property
                            damage to be about $800,000, with an additional $6,000,000 of indirect
                            damage resulting from loss of profits by the fishing industry, depressed
                            prices, and governmental expenditures. Under the circumstances described
                            by the American Embassy in Tokyo, and in view of the great importance of
                            this matter in United States–Japan relations, and in view of its
                            corresponding importance to the security of the United States, the
                            Department of State has concluded that a final compensation settlement
                            of $750,000 to as much as $1,000,000 would not be unreasonable.</p>
                        <p>The Operations Coordinating Board has considered this problem at length,
                            and has concluded that the promptest and most desirable method of
                            compensating the Japanese nationals injured in the Bikini incident would
                            be through the furnishing of not more than <pb xml:id="pg_1666" n="1666" facs="0610"/>$1,000,000 worth of relief and rehabilitation
                            assistance under the terms of Section 513 (b) of the Mutual Security Act
                            of 1951, as amended.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, it is recommended that the President determine, pursuant to
                            Section 513 (b), (1) that up to $1,000,000 of the funds available under
                            the Mutual Security Act may be used for the purpose of furnishing
                            special assistance to Japan for the compensatory relief and
                            rehabilitation of Japanese nationals who sustained personal and property
                            damage as a result of the recent nuclear test in the Marshall Islands,
                            without regard to the requirements of the Mutual Security Act or any
                            other Act for which funds are authorized by that Act, and (2) that the
                            use of these funds is important to the security of the United States. In
                            the event that you make this determination, it is contemplated that the
                            funds to be used for this purpose will be drawn from the funds
                            appropriated by the Mutual Security Appropriation Act, 1954, for
                            assistance authorized by Section 540 of the Mutual Security Act of 1951
                            for the purpose of Section 101 (a) (1).</p>
                        <p>This recommendation has the concurrence of the Secretary of State, the
                            Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. The

                                    <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison, John</persName>)</note> you
                            will remember that we were unable to finish our conversation regarding
                            Japan and its economic problems. It has occurred to me, therefore, that
                            you might be interested in some observations which time did not permit
                            me to make when we last met.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s economic plight is indeed most serious, owing in part to its own
                            actions (or failure to act) and in part to forces, both domestic and
                            international, beyond its control. In recent years the
                            balance-of-payments position of Japan has steadily deteriorated from a
                            surplus, adding $331 million to its foreign exchange reserves in 1951,
                            to an estimated deficit (based on returns for 5 months) of $452 million
                            in 1954. Obviously this situation cannot long continue. Japan is at
                            fault because it has not adopted those measures of austerity which the
                            United Kingdom, West Germany, and the Netherlands found necessary to
                            rebuild and strengthen their economies. And the free world is also at
                            fault because it has not recognized the magnitude of the problem and
                            offered Japan admittance into the society of free nations on terms of
                            equality.</p>
                        <p>You are fully aware, I realize, of the importance of preventing Japan
                            from slipping behind the “bamboo curtain,” of keeping it enrolled in the
                            cause of the free world. To assure this result, however, there must be a
                            cooperative effort by Japan, the United States, and the other free
                            nations. The United States cannot provide the solution alone. The
                            deterioration in Japan’s economic position has occurred despite special
                            dollar receipts (expenditures for goods and services) which averaged
                            annually $750 million in 1951–53 and may equal $600 million in 1954. In
                            fact these expenditures have been utilized to raise the level of living
                            in Japan to a height (slightly above the prewar level) which unassisted
                            it cannot afford to maintain.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1668" n="1668" facs="0612"/>
                        <p>Although I strongly believe that the United States must assist Japan to
                            develop a self-supporting economy, the primary effort must come from
                            Japan itself. Until that country is prepared to make such an effort,
                            assistance from the United States, in whatever amount, will fail to
                            accomplish its objective. Instead it will merely postpone the inevitable
                            readjustment which will gain in severity by the delay.</p>
                        <p>I am most anxious that the United States should avoid assuming the
                            obligation of underwriting the stability of Japanese economy.
                            Consequently, I believe that we should make it crystal clear to the
                            Japanese, in a firm but friendly fashion, that assistance from the
                            United States is contingent upon Japanese efforts to adopt and adhere to
                            a program of austerity designed to maximize self help. Such a program
                            should probably include sound fiscal and credit policies, restriction of
                            imports, stimulation of exports, allocation of imported raw materials,
                            land reclamation, expansion of power facilities, modernization of
                            industrial plant, and encouragement of foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>With such a program in force, the United States could then offer
                            assistance to expedite the necessary development, confident in the
                            knowledge that its efforts would bear fruit which thus far has failed to
                            materialize. If Japan is willing to help itself, the United States could
                            offer to maximize procurement in Japan, thus providing dollars and
                            strengthening Japan’s industrial base. It could also continue its
                            present endeavor to secure for Japan most-favored-nation treatment and
                            improved export opportunities through multilateral negotiations with the
                            contracting parties in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
                                (<gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>). Two other measures occur to
                            me which would provide assistance at minimum cost to the United States.
                            Concerning these I would appreciate your personal opinion as well as
                            your estimate of the probable reaction of the Congress.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we have proposed that Japan liquidate its <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> obligation to the United States
                            on a basis comparable to the settlement made with Germany. In the case
                            of Japan this would amount to approximately $700 million, or 37.5
                            percent of its total obligation, with interest at 2.5 percent, and
                            principal payments, after a 5year moratorium, in 60 semi-annual
                            payments. Many Japanese labors under the false impression that postwar
                            assistance from the United States was a gift; hence they see no
                            necessity for repayment. This makes the assumption of the obligation a
                            difficult political task for the Japanese Government. Moreover, with
                            their deteriorating balance-of-payments position, they hesitate to
                            assume this additional foreign exchange burden despite the liberal terms
                            of the proposal. Japan today is in need of capital for urgent economic
                                <pb xml:id="pg_1669" n="1669" facs="0613"/>projects to reclaim land,
                            expand power facilities, and modernize industrial plant—capital in
                            excess of that which it can provide in order that these essential tasks
                            may be undertaken and completed within the limited time remaining.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I would propose that Japan be asked to pay this entire
                            obligation ($700 million) in 7 annual installments in terms of yen. Each
                            year this payment (equivalent to $100 million in yen) would be loaned to
                            the Government of Japan for the purpose of developing land, power, and
                            industrial plant. After a 7–year moratorium, principal payments in
                            dollars would be made in 50 semiannual installments. Interest would be
                            at 2.5 percent from the date of the funding of the obligation on the
                            unpaid balance.</p>
                        <p>This proposal appears to have several distinct advantages. It would
                            stimulate projects essential to strengthen Japan’s economy and thus
                            operate to facilitate ultimate repayment of the obligation, now far from
                            certain. Japan would more readily accept the settlement because it would
                            be designed to provide assistance as well as repayment. Since the yen
                            payments would be derived from budgeted tax revenues, the loans would
                            not be inflationary because tax payments would be returned to the
                            economy without any net addition to purchasing power. Countries claiming
                            reparations could not charge that the United States had extracted its
                            “pound of flesh” to their detriment, as they will otherwise be inclined
                            to do. The United States will lose nothing by the proposal; on the
                            contrary, it will be encouraging projects designed to make repayment
                            possible. The terms will not be dissimilar from those granted Germany;
                            indeed the formula utilized to obtain the total net obligation would be
                            the same and the debt would be paid in 32 rather than 35 years. If, in
                            any case, the United States will find it necessary to assist Japan, why
                            not turn this <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> obligation into
                            a mutual asset rather than a mutual liability?</p>
                        <p>A second proposal to which I should like to draw your attention concerns
                            the disposal of United States stocks of surplus agricultural products.
                            Japan, a deficit food area, is deeply interested in the prospect of
                            acquiring such products, particularly if it is permitted to make
                            purchases in yen and secure a substantial portion on a grant basis. If
                            it is assumed that the United States, to assist Japan and at the same
                            time dispose of its agricultural surpluses, is willing to offer generous
                            terms of sale including a substantial portion of the yen proceeds as a
                            grant-in-aid, then I suggest a stipulation that such funds be so
                            utilized as to provide the maximum benefit to the Japanese economy. I
                            believe that a special advantage would be obtained if the grant portion
                            of the yen sales were utilized to facilitate regional development in
                            Southeast Asia by assisting Japan in the settlement of the reparations
                            problem. The absence of such a <pb xml:id="pg_1670" n="1670" facs="0614"/>settlement has prevented the restoration of normal political and trade
                            relations between Japan and the Philippines, Indonesia, Burma, and the
                            Associated States of Indochina. Prolongation of the dispute will
                            intensify the antagonism of the claimant states toward Japan. Part of
                            the difficulty has been the failure to reach agreement on the amount of
                            reparations to be paid, and a second barrier has been the requirement in
                            the Treaty of Peace that reparations should impose no foreign exchange
                            burden on Japan. Hence, if claimant countries desire capital goods on
                            reparation account, they must, under the provisions of the Treaty,
                            provide the raw materials essential to the manufacture of such goods or
                            the equivalent in foreign exchange. This the claimant countries have
                            been unwilling to do. Both of these difficulties might be overcome if
                            Japan were to utilize the grant funds, which the United States would
                            make available in any case, to augment reparation payments and eliminate
                            the requirement that claimant countries provide the raw materials to be
                            utilized in the manufacture of capital goods on reparation account.</p>
                        <p>A number of considerations appear to favor this proposal. The United
                            States would be assured that its grants of surplus products had been
                            constructively employed; moreover, by strengthening the economies of
                            Japan and claimant countries, it would ultimately share in the mounting
                            volume of trade arising from increased purchasing power. Japan would
                            find it easier to dispose of the troublesome reparations problem, both
                            because it could afford to offer a larger settlement and because
                            claimants would be freed from the contingent liability of providing raw
                            materials for capital goods. The claimant countries would receive a
                            larger total sum and could order whatever capital goods their economies
                            might require. Both Japan and the claimant countries would find trade
                            between them expanding because of the resumption of normal political
                            relations and the gradual expansion of purchasing power arising from the
                            profitable employment of reparations equipment. Finally, claimant
                            countries would obtain a share in the disposal of surplus agricultural
                            products by the United States, which participation might otherwise be
                            denied them inasmuch as none is a food deficit area.</p>
                        <p>I regret having written at such length. The subject, however, is of great
                            importance to the United States and its future position in the Pacific.
                            I am most anxious to have your views on these proposals and shall look
                            forward to your reply with great interest.</p>

                                Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom that the United States was
                                planning to initiate discussions with Japan concerning the loan of a
                                training submarine to Japan for training purposes, that it would
                                probably be 8 to 10 months before the vessel could be transferred,
                                and that since it could be expected that the information might
                                become public in advance, the Commonwealth powers might desire to
                                prepare the ground so that public reaction could be minimized. In a
                                briefing memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">McClurkin</persName> dated June 21, <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">Finn</persName> stated: “We should make it plain that we intend
                                to move ahead on the loan in any event. Only a major protest from
                                the Australian Government should delay further consideration of this
                                loan.” (794.5621/6–2154)</note> that a United States submarine
                            should be transferred on loan to the Japanese Government for use in
                            anti-submarine training of Japanese naval forces. The Ambassador desires
                            to express the Australian Government’s appreciation of the Secretary’s
                            action in informing them of this proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Australian Government would have preferred it if the United States
                            submarine had been manned by United States personnel. At the same time
                            the Government appreciates that, for defensive purposes, Japan needs
                            numbers of anti-submarine craft, and that for the training of these
                            craft it is necessary to have a target submarine. The Australian
                            Government is therefore agreeable to the above proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Australian Government hopes however that publicity on this phase of
                            Japanese defence preparations would be kept to a minimum. It should also
                            be pointed out that the above decision does not imply that Australia
                            would necessarily approve provision to the Japanese of submarines for
                            combat purposes.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Preamble</p>
                        <p>Under Article 3 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan the United States is
                            exercising all and any powers of administration, legislation, and
                            jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants of Nansei Shoto south of
                            29° north latitude, including territorial waters, except with respect to
                            the islands in the Amami Oshima group, the administration of which the
                            United States has relinquished to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The remaining islands of Nansei Shoto specified in Article 3 of the
                            Treaty of Peace with Japan over which the United States continues to
                            exercise authority (hereinafter referred to as the Ryukyu Islands) are
                            of critical strategic importance to the security of the free world. For
                            this reason the United States has developed in these islands a system of
                            military bases and other installations to serve the defense of the

                        <p>1. Prior to the coming into effect of the Treaty of Peace with Japan the
                            Ryukyu Islands were administered as enemy territory under U.S. military
                            occupation. With the effective date of the Treaty the Islands ceased to
                            be enemy territory. However, the administrative, legislative and
                            judicial powers over the Islands, conferred on the United States by
                            Article 3 of the Peace Treaty have <pb xml:id="pg_1674" n="1674" facs="0618"/>been and will continue to be exercised by the

                            good relations with their neighbors. It is the primary responsibility of
                            the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands to foster conditions
                            in the islands which will enable the U.S. Armed Forces to carry out
                            their mission successfully.</p>
                        <p>2. In pursuance of this mission the basic objectives of the Civil

                                the efforts of the Ryukyuan people.</item>

                            These courts shall exercise jurisdiction over all resident Ryukyuans.
                            Their jurisdiction will be extended, at the discretion of the Civil

                        <p>1. The Civil Administration will conduct a civil information and
                            education program, the primary purposes and principles of which are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>(a) The skills and facilities available through the program will
                                be utilized in all possible ways to facilitate and hasten
                                achievement of the basic objectives of the Civil Administration, and
                                to assist the components of the Civil Administration in the
                                accomplishment of specific projects and programs.</item>
                            <item>(b) The civil information and education program will give strong
                                encouragement and assistance to the development, among the Ryukyuan
                                people, of competence and willingness to assume progressively
                                greater responsibility in the conduct and support of civil
                                affairs.</item>
                            <item>(c) The civil information and education program will provide
                                advice and counsel to Ryukyuan educational institutions at all
                                levels, encouraging the establishment and maintenance of an
                                educational system appropriate to the needs and capabilities of the
                                Ryukyuan people and to their Japanese heritage.</item>
                            <item>(d) In fulfilling the other objectives set forth in this section
                                the civil information and education program will strive to create
                                among the Ryukyuan people attitudes of understanding, friendship,
                                trust, and common interest relative to the United States and other
                                members of the free world community.</item>

                        <p>The Civil Administration will cooperate with the Government of the Ryukyu
                            Islands to secure satisfactory standards of public health and welfare
                            for the Ryukyuan people. The Civil Administration may contribute, out of
                            available funds, to the maintenance of such standards.</p>

                        <p>The Civil Administration will advise and assist the Government of the
                            Ryukyu Islands and the local governments to establish public safety
                            systems which will assure the peaceful maintenance of law and order in a

                        <p>1. The exercise of full governmental powers in the Ryukyus on the basis
                            of the Peace Treaty with Japan provides authority for the Civil
                            Administration to utilize the public property of the Japanese Government
                            in the Ryukyuan Islands as the United States authority designated to
                            exercise the United States powers of administration, legislation and
                            jurisdiction in the islands. The Civil Administration may in its
                            discretion permit the Government of the Ryukyu <pb xml:id="pg_1679" n="1679" facs="0623"/>Islands to use or dispose of such property on
                            such terms and conditions as it determines.</p>
                        <p>2. The Civil Administration will be the U.S. agency responsible for the
                            acquisition of real estate and other facilities in the Ryukyu Islands
                            required for the use of United States Government agencies. Property for
                            the use of United States Government agencies will be acquired by
                            purchase or lease, negotiated by the <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss>
                            when appropriate, with the owners of the property. In addition, when
                            appropriate and when funds have been authorized for the purpose, use of
                            certain property for so long as it may be needed by the United States
                            may be procured by the acquisition of easement interests in such
                            property, full compensation in the amount of the appraised value of the
                            property being made initially to the owners. In the event that purchases
                            or easements for property cannot be negotiated on equitable and
                            reasonable terms, the Civil Administration shall determine, after
                            consultation with local authorities and the Government of the Ryukyu
                            Islands, whether the property is required for use by the United States.
                            The Government of the Ryukyu Islands shall acquire for the United States
                            the necessary leasehold or easement interests in the property by the
                            exercise of the right of eminent domain in condemnation proceedings and
                            the United States shall make reasonable and prompt compensation. The
                            condemned property shall be made available to the United States by the
                            Government of the Ryukyu Islands or acquisition may be affected by the
                            Civil Administration directly.</p>
                        <p>3. The Civil Administration in determining the facilities and areas to be
                            made available to the United States armed forces in carrying out their
                            military mission shall give full consideration to the effect which such
                            determination may have on the economic and social life of the Ryukyuan
                            people and give adequate respect to the property rights of the
                            individuals concerned.</p>
                        <p>4. The Civil Administration will act as the agent of the United States in
                            compensating private owners of real estate or other property for the use
                            of their land and/or other property subsequent to July 1, 1950.</p>
                        <p>5. The Civil Administration will advise and encourage the Ryukyuan
                            Government in developing and maintaining adequate records of land
                            titles.</p>
                        <p>6. Nonresident individuals or corporations owning real estate in the
                            Ryukyu Islands which is not needed by the United States Government may
                            continue to control such property, if it is reasonably utilized to the
                            benefit of the Ryukyuan economy. Should these owners decline to permit
                            such use of their property, the Government of the Ryukyu Islands may, at
                            the direction of the Civil Administration, <pb xml:id="pg_1680" n="1680" facs="0624"/>condemn the land and use it for the benefit of the
                            Ryukyuan economy.</p>
                        <p rend="center">K. Supplementary Instructions</p>
                        <p>1. The Civil Administration will assist the Government of the Ryukyu
                            Islands in the development of a program to resettle Ryukyuans, who have
                            been deprived of land by the requirements of U.S. military forces,
                            within the Ryukyuan archipelago and other suitable areas.</p>
                        <p>2. The Civil Administration will have prepared and will transmit to the
                            Department of Defense from time to time, as requested, estimates, with
                            complete justification, of appropriations from United States funds for
                            the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyuan Islands. It will be
                            responsible for the expenditure, under approved procedures, of funds
                            made available for such purposes. Monthly progress reports will be
                            prepared and submitted to the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>3. All United States agencies in the Ryukyu Islands will abide by and
                            conform to Civil Administration ordinances and directives.</p>

                            by this directive.</p>
                        <p>5. The proclamations, ordinances and directives heretofore issued by the

                        <p>In exercising its powers the Civil Administration will maintain close
                            contacts with Ryukyuans in responsible and influential positions. Within
                            these contacts it will be appropriate for the Civil Administration <pb xml:id="pg_1681" n="1681" facs="0625"/>to provide information,
                            assistance and guidance rather than to exercise authoritative
                            prerogatives. Every effort will be made, through such counsel and
                            consultation methods, to insure that final actions by the Government of
                            the Ryukyu Islands and its functional and local subdivisions will embody
                            solutions acceptable to the Civil Administration. This will considerably
                            reduce the necessity for the Civil Administration actually to take the
                            extreme step of vetoing legislation, nullifying an election, reversing
                            an announced executive action, or otherwise overriding an act of the
                            Government of the Ryukyu Islands or interfering with the latter’s normal
                            functions. It is the policy of the U.S. to reduce its responsibilities
                            for civil administration of the Ryukyus as rapidly as compatible with
                            military requirements. The ultimate authority to control the government
                            of the Islands rests with the Civil Administration. Subject to the
                            foregoing, however, the Administration will:</p>
                        <p>1. Promote an atmosphere of mutual cooperation and understanding in which
                            the Government of the Ryukyu Islands can be permitted to exercise the
                            normal power of government in all matters of domestic
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>2. Advise and consult with the appropriate Ryukyuan executive and
                            legislative authorities in advance of legislation by the Ryukyuan
                            legislature or the municipal legislative bodies with a view to making
                            unnecessary the uses of the veto power.</p>
                        <p>3. Refrain from the exercise of the authority to review decision of the
                            Ryukyuan courts except in cases involving a serious threat to the
                            fulfillment of the Civil Administration mission.</p>
                        <p>4. Cooperate and coordinate with the Government of the Ryukyu Islands and
                            with the municipal governments of all levels in the formulation and
                            development of programs, policies and procedures, while recognizing that
                            such governments should be accorded as much freedom as possible in
                            achieving the political aspirations of the Ryukyuan people in fostering
                            their trade, commerce, and industry, and in developing the resources of
                            the islands.</p>
                        <p>5. Refrain from exercising its power to remove from office officials of
                            any level of Ryukyuan government except in instances where the
                            continuance of the official in office would constitute a serious threat
                            to the fulfillment of the Civil Administration mission.</p>
                        <p>6. Encourage political parties, with rights of assembly and public
                            discussion. However, such rights need not be extended to political
                            groups or organisations which advocate political, governmental or social
                            change by means other than orderly legal processes or peaceful petition,
                            or which operate in such fashion as to preclude effective control over
                            party policies and activities by the full membership of such
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>7. Make every reasonable effort to achieve its civilian administration
                            objectives with a minimum disruption of the lives of the Ryukyuan
                            people.</p>

                        <p>My Dear Mr. Minister: May I take this opportunity of expressing
                            appreciation for your letter of May 31, 1954,<note n="2" xml:id="d778fn2">Transmitted in telegram 2984 from Tokyo, June 3,
                                not printed. (811.05194/6–354)</note> on the subject of American
                            investment in Japan, and the offer of your Government to discuss with
                            the Embassy specific proposals for investment.</p>
                        <p>Your letter reiterates your Government’s long-standing position that it
                            generally welcomes foreign investments. This statement is appreciated
                            for, as you know, it is the belief of the United States Government that
                            foreign investment can make a significant contribution in strengthening
                            Japan’s economy. The Government of the United States believes strongly
                            that Japan should encourage those American investments which will assist
                            Japan in augmenting its foreign exchange reserves. The application of
                            any other policy would not only deprive Japan of assistance it might
                            otherwise obtain, but would also be in contravention of the provisions
                            of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between our two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>It is with this in mind that I take the liberty of commenting on the
                            criteria which you state in your letter will be used by the Japanese
                            Government in evaluating applications for American investment. In the
                            opinion of my Government, the <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> Treaty
                            recognizes only one qualification as modifying Japan’s obligation to
                            grant national treatment to American businessmen seeking to make
                            investments in Japan, with the exception of public utilities and other
                            enterprises specified in paragraph 2 of Article 7. The sole
                            qualification to which I refer is contained in paragraph 6 of the
                            Protocol to the Treaty which recognizes that either party may impose
                            such restrictions on the introduction of foreign capital as may be
                            necessary to protect its monetary reserves. In view of this provision, I
                            regret to note that the Japanese Government intends to apply additional
                            restrictions in screening investments. You indicate <pb xml:id="pg_1683" n="1683" facs="0627"/>that “it is the policy of the Japanese
                            Government to welcome foreign investments which contribute to the
                            development of our essential industries and public enterprises,” and
                            that the Japanese Government will “consider favorably any application
                            for such investments even if they compete to a certain extent with the
                            domestic industries.” As an overall consideration you point out that
                            careful study must be given to any investment “which would result in an
                            increase of luxury items or purely nonessential commodities in the
                            domestic market.”</p>
                        <p>My Government believes that the <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss>
                            Treaty contains no provision which would permit the exclusion of an
                            American investment on the basis of either the competition it affords to
                            domestic industries, or the degree of essentiality of the investment.
                            The sole criterion recognized by the Treaty is the effect of the
                            investment on Japan’s balance of payments. In view of the recent
                            deterioration in this aspect of Japan’s economy, it would appear that
                            any foreign investment which does not violate Japanese law should be
                            welcome, provided such investment serves to strengthen Japan’s foreign
                            exchange reserves by either expanding exports or reducing dependence
                            upon imports.</p>
                        <p>In addition to contributing to the strength of Japan’s foreign exchange
                            position, private American capital can provide increased employment, new
                            markets for Japanese products, modern equipment and technology, and new
                            sources of tax revenue. Thus, through increased efficiency and reduction
                            in cost, not only will the competitive position of Japanese products be
                            improved abroad, but also the domestic economy will be strengthened.</p>
                        <p>The United States has been assisting Japan in a number of ways to cope
                            with its foreign exchange problem. It has been making a substantial
                            portion of its offshore procurement in Japan and promoting arrangements
                            for expanding Japan’s export markets. It has undertaken to provide
                            military assistance to Japan and to pay all dollar costs and part of the
                            yen costs of maintaining United States forces in Japan. To reduce the
                            burden which the United States has assumed principally because of
                            Japan’s foreign exchange difficulties, the United States has a strong
                            interest in assuring that the Japanese Government does not reject such
                            American investments as can be expected to improve Japan’s foreign
                            exchange position. This interest adds to the concern which the United
                            States Government always feels to assure that the treaty rights of
                            individual American investors are respected.</p>
                        <p>It is my hope that Japan will not deny itself the simple and profitable
                            avenue of self-help which the encouragement of the investment of private
                            foreign capital can afford. I trust further that your Government will
                            re-examine its policies and practices regarding <pb xml:id="pg_1684" n="1684" facs="0628"/>foreign investment with the objective of
                            modifying them in accordance with the provisions of the <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> Treaty between our two countries. May I
                            request that the subject raised in this letter receive the thoughtful
                            consideration of your Government. I shall hold myself in readiness
                            further to discuss this problem at your early convenience.</p>

                            as Governor of the Ryukyu Islands. I am happy that agreement on the

                                the President had on Aug. 2 approved the directive and had also,
                                pursuant to its paragraph A2, approved General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> “for appointment as Governor

                        </p>
                        <p>The final sentence of paragraph 1, Section A of the directive provides:
                            “The Department of State, in consultation with appropriate agencies of
                            the Department of Defense, will in the future exercise all powers of the
                            United States with respect to the relations of the Ryukyu Islands with
                            foreign governments and international organizations.” I have noted that
                            acceptance of this provision is contingent upon the conclusion of an
                            understanding between the Department of Defense and the Department of
                            State with respect to this Department’s foreign relations responsibility
                            for the Ryukyu Islands and the means by which this responsibility is to
                            be exercised. I consider that this Department’s responsibility for the
                            foreign relations of the Ryukyu Islands might include the representation
                            and protection of Ryukyuan interests with respect to foreign countries
                            and international organizations. In my view this responsibility <pb xml:id="pg_1685" n="1685" facs="0629"/>should be exercised through
                            an officer of the Department of State who would act as a consultant on
                            foreign relations to the United States Governor of the Ryukyu Islands or
                            his Deputy. I suggest that representatives of our Departments might be
                            designated to meet and work out the details of such an arrangement.<note n="3" xml:id="d779fn3">In a reply dated Aug. 31, Deputy Secretary

                            You also referred to background material now being prepared by a public
                            relations group for use by national commentators in indicating the
                            necessity for more liberal trade relations between Japan and the United
                            States. We understand the desirability and even necessity of informing
                            people at home concerning Japan’s difficult trade position and the need
                            to safeguard ourselves and Japan against increased economic dependence
                            upon Communist China and the Soviet bloc. We also appreciate the great
                            importance of obtaining Congressional approval of a 3–year extension of
                            the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.</p>
                        <p>Although such a campaign is useful and even essential for home
                            consumption, it is interesting and significant that it is having a very
                            different effect in Japan. Japanese newspapers have been saying that
                            recent developments in Indochina and at Geneva would force the United
                            States to reappraise its Far Eastern policies and <pb xml:id="pg_1686" n="1686" facs="0630"/>would increase the importance of Japan in the
                            new program to be developed. Credence in this assumption has been
                            greatly augmented by the President’s remarks concerning the importance
                            of Japan to the United States, with its corollary of preventing Japan
                            from slipping behind the iron curtain. Similar statements of other
                            United States officials and editorial echoes in some of the newspapers
                            at home have served to strengthen in Japanese minds their concept of the
                            essentiality of Japan in United States Far Eastern policy. We sense that
                            there is a growing assurance among Japanese officials that our renewed
                            emphasis on Japan greatly enhances their bargaining position. The
                            attitude appears to be developing that, if they adopt a sufficiently
                            rigid position, the United States will be forced to meet their demands
                            for assistance whether in the military, economic, or political fields.
                            They seem to believe that they are now leading from strength rather than
                            weakness because, in their opinion, the United States believes it must
                            have Japan as an ally in the Pacific. Naturally, this change in attitude
                            will complicate our negotiations with the Japanese on many matters,
                            including their defense appropriation for next year, the amount of their
                            yen contribution in support of United States forces, the <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement, and the utilization
                            of the $10 million grant fund. It may also make them less willing to
                            adopt that degree of austerity essential to the success of any program
                            of self-help.</p>
                        <p>We seem to find ourselves in a dilemma, i.e., statements designed to be
                            helpful in promoting United States policy at home are proving
                            detrimental to that program abroad. In consequence, we are wondering
                            whether a word of caution would be inappropriate. Specifically, we offer
                            the suggestion that future statements dealing with the economic plight
                            of Japan might make it clear that, although the United States realizes
                            its importance and desires to be helpful, such assistance to be
                            effective is dependent upon the efforts of Japan first to do all within
                            its power in its own behalf. If future statements can carry the
                            implication that United States aid (of whatever type) is contingent upon
                            the adoption of a program of self-help by Japan and in fact can only be
                            effective under such circumstances, we believe it will have a sobering
                            effect and may make the Japanese more amenable. We pass this thought on
                            for your consideration in the belief that, if feasible, its application
                            would be salutary.</p>

                            Japan</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said that he
                            understood the United States representatives wished to talk about this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that there
                            are clearly a number of difficult problems to be solved but he believes
                            Japan will make a real effort to put relations with Korea on a fair and
                            honorable basis. Our <pb xml:id="pg_1688" n="1688" facs="0632"/>working
                            hypothesis in the Far East must be that Japan will become a reliable
                            member of the Free World. Otherwise the whole balance in the Pacific
                            could turn against us.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said that it is
                            correct for the United States to desire peaceful relations between Japan
                            and Korea, but he hoped the United States Government would try to find
                            out which party is right and which wrong. In a quarrel one party is
                            wrong.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> suggested that
                            perhaps both might be wrong to some extent.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> rehearsed a number
                            of his long-standing complaints against Japan. He said that Japan claims
                            85% of Korean property, and that Japan is insisting on regarding Korea
                            as one of its former possessions despite the Peace Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was
                            not himself aware of any claim by Japan to 85% of the territory of
                            Korea. Clearly that would be an outrageous violation of the Peace
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Yang reported some of Kubota’s remarks of October 16,
                                1953<note n="2" xml:id="d781fn2">See <ref target="#d689fn6">footnote
                                    6, Document 689</ref>.</note> in the course of negotiations
                            between the Koreans and the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that the
                            United States sent its men through the United Nations to protect Korea.
                            He could not conceive how we can be accused of trying to make Koreans
                            bow their necks to the Japanese. A clause in the Japanese Peace Treaty
                            which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> negotiated
                            specifically protects Korea. We will talk to the Japanese just as
                            frankly as we do to the Koreans. He asked whether President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would like us to begin an
                            exploration of the whole tangled problem, perhaps leading to eventual
                            adjudication. He thought we could produce people who would be completely
                            fair. He concluded by referring to the desirability of good relations
                            among Japan, Korea and Formosa.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> then brought up the
                            question of the fishing line and detailed the history of this question,
                            beginning with the <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            Line. He said it is necessary to have such a line if Korea is to live in
                            peace with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that this is
                            a very difficult question. In a situation where there is the tension
                            which exists between Korea and Japan something of the sort would seem to
                            make sense. On the other hand, there is the problem of the traditional
                            United States position with respect to freedom of the seas. Perhaps it
                            would be possible to work out a sort of self-denying ordinance in which
                            the Japanese would agree that they would not send any fishing boats into
                            certain areas, but without doing violation to the general principle of
                            freedom of access to the high seas.</p>

                        <p>He then went on to ask whether the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            had any concrete suggestion. He said that we would be glad to do
                            anything we can to help. He wondered whether the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would like to have some form of arbitration or to set
                            up a panel of some kind or to refer the question to the World Court.
                            Another possibility would be that we provide an individual to observe
                            and to mediate if the Japanese also agreed to have such a person.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said that the United
                            States must tell <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> first whether we
                            believe the Koreans are right or the Japanese are right.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that we
                            cannot give such answers now because we have not explored these
                            questions sufficiently. However, we will try to find out where justice
                            lies.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Yang referred to his discussions in Washington with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> and emphasized that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is willing and anxious to settle
                            these questions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> read the
                            statement which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName>
                            had proposed the Japanese make publicly.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Yang said that if the Japanese will consent to make that
                            statement publicly, the Koreans would resume negotiations.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that if
                            we are going to support our friends we cannot have them fighting each
                            other. We have a great deal of sympathy for the Korean position with
                            respect to Japan, but we do feel that friendly relations between the two
                            countries are essential to the security of the whole area. If the
                            Koreans and the Japanese can improve their relations by direct
                            negotiations, so much the better. If it is necessary for us to

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> emphasized that
                            the Koreans should not think that United States sympathies lie with
                            Japan rather than with Korea, because they do not. We have not forgotten
                            that Japan was our enemy, whereas Korea has been our ally. What has been
                            said by the United States representatives in this discussion is the
                            policy of the United States Government regardless of any isolated
                            remarks by individuals on any other occasion. He added that he believes
                            the Japanese have made a serious mistake by clinging to a rather tenuous
                            legal claim in order to attempt to buttress their bargaining position.
                            We can and will exert influence on the Japanese to deal with these
                            problems in a statesmanlike way instead of on the basis of sharp
                            trading.</p>

                        <p>1. Vice-Director Defense Agency Masuhara told General Higgins July 21
                            precarious economic situation necessitating cuts in Japanese fiscal year
                            1954 budget and probable 90 billion yen ceiling for Japanese fiscal year
                            1955 defense budget. Masuhara stated as result tentative decision
                            several weeks ago by Finance Minister Japanese fiscal year 1954 defense
                            budget unofficially cut 10 percent forcing curtailment troop maneuvers
                            and reduction stock reserve to only 5 percent as against 16–20 percent
                            considered advisable by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Further
                            1954 budget cuts anticipated. Finance Ministry threatening cut in funds
                            for naval personnel if United States fails turn over 17 combatant
                            vessels, since personnel plans for Japanese fiscal year 1954 based on
                            anticipation receipt these vessels. Naval construction under way will be
                            completed but Masuhara doubts that further major construction will be
                            started in immediate future. Funds for essential ground force
                            construction may also be cut.</p>
                        <p>Japanese fiscal year 1955 budget ceiling expected to result in sharp
                            curtailment plans to add 30,000 men to defense forces. Masuhara
                            suggested that even slight increase in defense budget will be
                            conditional on equivalent reduction yen contribution support US forces

                        <p>1. Inter-relationship of economic-defense-<gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> problem and need for coordinated planning on US side
                            was recognized.</p>
                        <p>2. Cuts in Japanese fiscal year 1954 defense budget although not yet
                            official represented violation of spirit Japanese commitment in
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> letters April 6, 1954.</p>
                        <p>3. General prospect for next few years is decreasing US military
                            expenditures in Japan.</p>
                        <p>4. Recently, Japanese Government has made number of uncoordinated and
                            even contradictory approaches for US aid, such as: joint committee

                                oral replies given by a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> team.
                                The questions concerned the strategic role of Japan and Japanese
                                force levels, equipment, and procurement. (Memorandum by Dunning,
                                794.5/7–2254)</note> above-mentioned <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> letter to <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>; road project; request for $130 million in
                            agricultural surplus; request for negotiations on special dollar
                            receipts; <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and IMF negotiations, et
                            cetera.</p>
                        <p>5. Common to all these requests is failure of Japanese to set forth
                            concurrent internal actions to be undertaken on own behalf, despite
                            obvious need for tough, coordinated economic and defense policies.
                            Desirability of insisting on self-help policies prior to giving further
                            US assistance seems required by Japanese attitude.</p>
                        <p>6. Unwillingness to prosecute realistic austerity program with necessary
                            vigor and determination attributed to weakness of present Japanese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>7. Need exists to explore all possibilities for direct defense assistance
                            to Japan including (a) delivery of additional ships and four-five year
                            $50 million <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> program for naval

                            established for items which can be produced in Japan.</p>
                        <p>8. Formation of continuing US-Japanese consultative body to serve as
                            channel for all Japanese requests and main negotiating body considered
                            desirable. . . .</p>

                        <p>It was also decided that (a) Ambassador would informally discuss 10
                            percent budget cut with Foreign Minister pointing out advisability joint

                            and inclusion internal actions Japanese Government will undertake.</p>
                        <p>Part IV—Recommendations.</p>
                        <p>1. Immediate discussions with Japanese Government on formation joint
                            US–Japan consultative group as indicated paragraph 8 Part II. On US
                            side, Embassy–<gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> initially would be represented. If

                            included.</p>
                        <p>2. Delay in further commitments to Japanese, including Kaihara, pending

                            recommendations and formulation by Japanese of coordinated program.</p>

                            economic position of that country. He indicated that there was little
                            future for Japanese products in the United States, and that the solution
                            lay in developing markets for Japan in presently underdeveloped areas
                            such as Southeast Asia. Since such development is necessarily long-term,
                            interim measures would be needed. He then cited the major responsibility
                            held by the United States as a result of past events and the need for
                            the entire Administration rather than just the State Department to
                            effect a workable program.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that no single action would solve the Japanese
                            economic problem but that a variety of approaches must be made. He
                            suggested that it was an absolute fallacy to say that there should be
                                <hi rend="italic">no</hi> East-West trade. Instead, some Japanese
                            trade with her Communist neighbors might be encouraged and would set up
                            influences behind the iron curtain detrimental to Communism. Such trade,
                            of course, would have to be closely watched.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General inquired as to our policy concerning Japanese armed
                            forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that
                            they were being increased now that the security agreements had been
                            signed and that some of our own divisions presently in Japan could be
                            redeployed. <pb xml:id="pg_1694" n="1694" facs="0638"/>The President
                            immediately noted that redeployment would increase the economic problem
                            since it would take dollars out of Japan.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> of
                                Commerce<note n="2" xml:id="d783fn2">Samuel W. Anderson, Assistant
                                Secretary of Commerce.</note> explained a series of charts
                            highlighting the Japanese economic problems. They included statistics
                            concerning size and density of population, insufficiency of food
                            production, comparisons of foreign trade pre–1940 and now and in terms
                            of geographic areas of the world, types of imports and exports, trade
                            deficit and the foreign exchange situation. He then proceeded to
                            indicate that a solution of the problem depended upon greater austerity
                            within Japan by returning to the mid-1930’s standard of living,
                            increasing exports through participation in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> (General Agreement on Tariff [<hi rend="italic">Tariffs</hi> ]and Trade),<note n="3" xml:id="d783fn3">For

                            elimination of certain unfair trade practices. It would also require
                            U.S. effort with regard to including Japan in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, giving a maximum of economic and military aid, making
                            grants or loans of agricultural surpluses for local currency, and

                            imports of Japanese goods and limiting their reparations demands.</p>
                        <p>The President then emphasized the need for making the attack on this
                            problem on a broad front, and he asked all Cabinet members to review
                            this material for the purpose of contributing new ideas and also the
                            urgency of working this subject into their public addresses. He
                            indicated the controversy which would arise in connection with foreign
                            economic policy legislation in the coming year and stressed that to bar
                            all competitive products would result, in the long run, in the disaster
                            of war.</p>

                            understanding of the problem and points of view expressed but wanted to
                            call attention to the drastic differential in wage scales. He urged that
                            Japan if taken into <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> should be
                            subject to the customary peril point and escape clauses. He preferred an
                            examination of alternative methods such as military aid, quotas, etc.
                            The President commented that he desired such ideas to be expressed and
                            then went on to warn that Japan had to make its already low wages even
                            lower—and that if forced too far, Japan would become ripe for Communism.
                            Gov. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed to the need
                            for distributing action over many fields as his <pb xml:id="pg_1695" n="1695" facs="0639"/>

                            Japan was already attempting. He stated that U.S. exports to Japan would
                            suffer if the Japanese cannot export their own products, and he singled
                            out the trade relationship involving Southern purchases of New England
                            products with money derived from the sale of cotton to Japan. Sec.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> believed the
                            emphasis should be put on spreading Japanese exports throughout the
                            world rather than having the U.S. carry the burden of buying Japanese
                            goods. He emphasized unemployment within the U.S. and the dislocation
                            caused by Japanese products such as electrical equipment.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed and again stated that the U.S. must prevent the
                            development of a situation in Japan which would result in a Communist
                            take-over.</p>
                        <p>In a discussion of the timing of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations, Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> described the elaborate procedures and the need

                        <p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFA1">Waring</persName>: Reference is made
                            to my letter of 24 July 1954, in which I indicated concurrence in
                            principle with Mr. Meyer’s report, “An Economic Program for Japan” dated
                            July <pb xml:id="pg_1696" n="1696" facs="0640"/>1954<note n="1" xml:id="d784fn1">A copy of this report is attached to a letter dated
                                Aug. 5 from <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, neither printed.
                                (894.10/8–554) For a brief summary of the report, see <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s memorandum to the
                                Secretary, <ref target="#d794">Document 794</ref>.</note> and
                            offered some preliminary comments thereon. In my previous letter I
                            mentioned that in my opinion the report implies that the program for
                            offshore procurement and industrial mobilization is farther advanced
                            than it really is. I confirm this to be the case.</p>
                        <p>The description of Japan’s economic problem and her current economic
                            condition appears accurate and the measures recommended to correct
                            Japan’s economic ills are soundly conceived. There is, however, a
                            fundamental omission from the report which I, having listened to your
                            own words of wisdom on this subject, feel should be mentioned:</p>
                        <p>United States execution of a program for economic aid to Japan should be
                            contingent upon and related to Japan’s own performance of an acceptable
                            complementary program. Our experience with foreign aid programs in other
                            countries supports the conclusion that failure to establish reciprocal
                            measures to be required of the recipient country leads to pyramiding
                            demands for further United States aid rather than maximum self
                            assistance. Our experience with Japan with respect to military aid has
                            been that whereas the United States Army secured the funds and was
                            prepared, to furnish the equipment for a 10–division army, the Japanese
                            have shown no willingness to form more than half such a force. The 10
                            old type divisions are equal to 15 new type divisions, of which the
                            Japanese may raise 7 1/3 by 1956. At the same time, Japan has been
                            asking for more offshore procurement orders.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the Mission refers to the loss of colonial resources as
                            irreparable. This may be true in an absolute sense but it is my belief
                            that this problem is economically solvable by the development of greater
                            trade in non-strategic materials with China, greater trade with
                            Southeast Asia and closer integration of the Japanese economy with those
                            of Formosa and Korea.</p>

                        <p>To analyze the factors determining Japan’s present strength, stability,
                            and orientation, and to assess probable developments in Japan through
                            1957, with particular respect to Japan’s future role in Asia.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. Through 1957, Japan will not be in a position to play a leading or
                            stabilizing role in Asian affairs. Assuming a continuation of US
                            assistance, however, we believe that Japan will slowly gain in
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>2. Japan will almost certainly continue to be economically and militarily
                            dependent on the US. It will therefore continue to avoid any action that
                            might seriously jeopardize its alignment with the US, in spite of
                            numerous frictions arising out of its condition of dependence.</p>
                        <p>3. Within these limitations, Japan will attempt to pursue a more
                            independent foreign policy, notably in terms of establishing more active
                            and extensive economic and political relations with Communist China and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. There will probably be some
                            growth in neutralist sentiment, an increasing spirit of nationalism, and
                            a continuing critical appraisal of US policy.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1698" n="1698" facs="0642"/>
                        <p>4. Japan’s economic situation will continue to be precarious. Import
                            requirements will remain high and even with the probable increase in
                            trade with Communist China, exports will not be expanded sufficiently to
                            avoid continuing balance of payments difficulties. Therefore, Japan will
                            remain dependent on a continued high level of US expenditures and other
                            financial assistance.</p>
                        <p>5. Moderate conservative elements will probably continue to dominate
                            Japanese government and politics, although factional rivalry among the
                            conservative elements will probably hamper governmental effectiveness.
                            Conservative tenure is likely to be assisted by further increases in the
                            powers of the central government.</p>
                        <p>6. Although the Japanese Communist Party is not likely to gain
                            substantial parliamentary strength, it will continue to exercise an
                            important influence through its ability to aggravate popular grievances
                            and to exploit and infiltrate mass organizations of the non-Communist
                            left. The Communists will probably be able to maintain their underground
                            organization but not to increase significantly their potentialities for
                            sabotage and subversion.</p>
                        <p>7. Assuming US military assistance, the Japanese Government will continue
                            to rearm gradually during this period. By the end of the period, we
                            believe Japan will have military forces capable of making a substantial
                            contribution to its defense, but by no means adequate to assume full
                            responsibility therefor. Japan will be reluctant to accept military
                            commitments beyond the immediate defense of Japanese territory and will
                            hesitate to join any regional defense system.</p><gap/>

                            ago, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> has rapidly emerged as

                            Liberal Party leaders, he followed <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> to rostrum and made statements which in
                            substance were reported as follows:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. United States failed in its “roll-back policy” when Indochina

                                which would necessitate drastic revision of current policies,
                                rationalization of nation’s industries and safeguards against
                                extreme activities by labor unions.</item>
                            <item>f. Retrenchment (austerity) policies should be continued for

                            dynamic leadership than government has exhibited over past year or so is
                            most important development from standpoint of Japan’s role in Far East
                            and our relations with Japan. At his request, I am to see <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> August 13, 2:30 p.m. Tokyo time.

                            internal political developments. I believe this gives us timely
                            opportunity to comment on <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s
                            views as quoted in press and to correct obvious misapprehensions
                            regarding US position, particularly with respect to his appraisal of
                            strategic situation in Southeast Asia and basis for US economic
                            assistance. Press has repeatedly headlined in last several days all
                            manner of reports on alleged directive by President to prepare program
                            of economic aid for Japan, on impact of Meyer report outlining
                            seriousness Japanese economic position, and US Cabinet discussions
                            regarding Japan, et cetera, et cetera. Your statement at yesterday’s
                            press conference<note n="2" xml:id="d786fn2">
                                <p>When questioned
                                    concerning U.S. direct assistance to Japan at his news
                                    conference held in Washington on Aug. 10, the Secretary replied
                                    as follows:</p>
                                <p>“It is possible, but we do not think that that will be necessary.
                                    It may be desirable to make available some foodstuffs to Japan
                                    out of our surplus food crops and to do so on terms which would
                                    be liberal from the standpoint of payment—possibly in terms of
                                    local currency. But we do not anticipate the necessity for any
                                    economic aid to Japan, on the assumption that the Japanese
                                    handle their own fiscal and commercial affairs with prudence and
                                    firmness. It seems to us the situation can be dealt with without
                                    any direct economic aid. There is of course a certain amount of
                                    assistance that goes to Japan through our contribution to their
                                    enlarged security program and there are still a substantial
                                    number of U.S. troops in Japan which are spending money there.
                                    In that way there is a considerable amount of what you might
                                    call invisible exports to Japan which runs up into terms of
                                    several hundred million dollars, though not nearly as big as it
                                    was at the height of the Korean war when there were heavy
                                    purchases in Japan for use in Korea. There is a decline, but the
                                    figure is still quite a substantial one.”</p>

                            give impression US needs Japan more than vice versa. No doubt
                            expectations of help are running high and entering into <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s own calculations.</p>
                        <p>3. Regardless of future prospects for <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government and degree of support it may be in
                            our interest to give it, we shall have to reckon with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> increasingly to be ahead and I
                            therefore think it would be most helpful if I could have statement
                            directly from you to give him on Friday. This would, I hope, be
                            preliminary to statements which I hope you will be able to make en route
                            to Baguio or at least on way back, at which time I will have further
                            recommendations for talks with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and
                            others. At this time, however, in addition to whatever you may consider
                            it useful to say, I would propose that message from you include
                            following points:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. Indochina truce was not failure of roll-back policy of United
                                States. French never asked United States to intervene in Indochina
                                and truce was in essence recognition of facts of situation there.
                                There has therefore been no major change in strategic situation in
                                Southeast Asia except that necessity for greater sense of mutual in
                                terdependence in area is now more widely recognized. United States
                                moving to achieve greater strategic flexibility by withdrawal of all
                                but two divisions from Korea, and re-positioning elsewhere in Far
                                East outside Japan.</item>
                            <item>b. United States pleased to note <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s emphasis on measures to rationalize nation’s
                                industries as in last analysis Japan must restore her competitive
                                position in world’s markets if she is to achieve independence and
                                self-reliance which we, too, desire to see. However, it imperative
                                for <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and other Japanese
                                leaders to make clear to all that United States assistance to Japan
                                could only provide extra margin where needed to assure success over
                                and above Japan’s own efforts to rationalize the economy. The United
                                States has been deeply disappointed in failure Japan to make wise
                                use of special dollar receipts of past few years and must insist in
                                connection with any future aid requests from Japan on prerequisite
                                of such measures as selective controls, modernization plant, land
                                reclamation, et cetera, et cetera.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>United States particularly fearful that spate of publicity on expected
                            American assistance will cause certain elements in Japan relax efforts
                            and expect that Japan will be bailed out of any crisis by United States
                            because of United States conviction of importance of Japan as
                            anti-Communist bastion. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>
                            should know United States Congress, which has drastically cut <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> appropriations this year, would not
                            countenance assistance to country which after three years of decreasing
                            taxation again failed to tackle its problems with real determination.
                            Might also add, as has been pointed out in <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–Embassy discussions that shift toward neutrality, while
                                <pb xml:id="pg_1701" n="1701" facs="0645"/>not affecting economic

                            facilities, nevertheless, when added to an unwillingness to rearm

                            industrial mobilization base in Japan. Discussions suggested it would
                            not be sound judgment to build a mobilization production base in a
                            country which is exposed to enemy attack yet which has not shown
                            resolution in preparing for its own defense. The protection of such a
                            production base would tie down United States forces required

                        <p>I suppose one of the reasons which motivated <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s recent statements about Japan’s foreign policy
                            orientation was the expectation or hope that it might loosen U.S. purse
                            strings and enhance the possibility of a fat economic aid program for
                            Japan. This supposition is strengthened by the remarks about U.S.
                            assistance to Japan attributed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> in today’s <hi rend="italic">New York

                                course of a conversation held between <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">Finn</persName> on Aug. 11. “Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> referred to an article
                                appearing in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of August 11
                                summarizing an interview he had given. He said the figure of $1.5
                                billion mentioned by the reporter as a possible total of assistance
                                desired by Japan from the United States was of course
                                ‘preposterous’. The Ambassador said he had mentioned no such figure
                                and that the article was erroneous in a number of respects.”

                        <p>While the Indochinese situation furnished a convenient justification for
                            some such statement as <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s,
                            recent U.S. developments (including the President’s statement about
                            Japan and the subsequent Meyer Mission to Japan) certainly did not
                            discourage it.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese will, of course, expect some official U.S. reaction to
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s remarks. It seems to
                            me that a soft or too conciliatory reaction might justify the hope that
                            the bluff (assuming that it is a bluff) has worked. Consideration might
                            be given to the advisability of our slowing down a bit with respect to
                            some things in the <pb xml:id="pg_1702" n="1702" facs="0646"/>economic
                            field which Japan wants as a means of suggesting to the Japanese that we
                            were not greatly impressed by the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> statement. This could be done, I would think,
                            without harming our basic relation with Japan or prejudicing any
                            subsequent actions we might wish to take in the economic field.</p>

                        <p>There was at no time anything weak in our position. The dispatch of our

                        <p>We are eager have Japan develop a sense of mission and of destiny and to
                            develop for itself a role in Far East. I have been grievously
                            disappointed that so far Japan has been listless and drifting and
                            apparently expecting merely to be taken care of by U.S.</p>
                        <p>If Japan does want to have a destiny and future of its own it will have
                            to find it within free world which tolerates and welcomes diversity. It
                            will never find it in dependence upon Communist world which accepts only
                            conformity and domination by Soviet Communist Party as the “General

                        <p>If Japan has any ideas about Far Eastern policy we would like to know

                            million and suggested that in view of this decline Japanese contribution

                            be proportionately reduced.</p>

                            stated $100 million figure was estimate only and that United States made
                            no commitment that any specific portion would be paid in dollars. He
                            deplored tendency of Japanese to regard as firm commitment estimates
                            made in good faith which subsequently proved impossible and stated
                            failure to reach $100 million target caused by later procurement
                            cutbacks and inability place certain contracts in Japan. He states real

                            million and that Japanese position this issue, therefore, not

                        <p>1. I met <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> privately yesterday
                            at his request in Minister Finance residence where he hoped to be
                            undiscovered by press (this apparently was impossible; see <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 364).<note n="3" xml:id="d790fn3">In this telegram, dated Aug. 14, the Embassy transmitted the text
                                of an article concerning the <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>
                                meeting which had appeared in that day’s <hi rend="italic">Asahi
                                    Shimbun</hi>. (611.94/8–1454)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> accompanied <pb xml:id="pg_1705" n="1705" facs="0649"/>by Suzuki and Miyazawa and I
                            by <persName corresp="#p_DWW1">Diehl</persName> and Leonhart. Talk
                            lasted two hours, was frank, unrestrained, and of considerable
                            consequence in illustrating current official attitudes here.</p>
                        <p>2. I opened conversation by reading press accounts of what <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> was supposed to have said
                            off-the-record on August 9 and 10 and suggested that if he would like me
                            to report particular instances of misquotation I would be pleased to do
                            so. I would first however like to review for him recent <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> development and present strategic
                            situation in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> as it appeared to us. I
                            did so quoting paragraphs from Secretary’s June 11 address (which I left
                            with him) and general line Department’s 300.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> replied that he had of
                            course been misquoted, that he believed US-Japan cooperation was basic
                            to all aspects Japanese policy, so basic and well understood that he had
                            not believed it necessary to dwell on this essential in his off-record
                            remarks. What he had been trying to do was infuse some freshness and
                            some sense new policy into Liberal Party. We should recognize that never
                            has prestige Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and
                            liberals been so low as it is today, that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and liberals are determined to put US–Japan
                            cooperation on permanent and lasting basis but to do so they need
                            increased strength. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> is
                            old man and there are many things he does not understand, but he is
                            still “one of few men” in Japan who can develop sound foundation for
                            US–Japan relations.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> continued that is why
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> trip to US is so
                            important, why it should be made as soon as possible, and why it was
                            indispensable for <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> to bring
                            back real presents from US. On timing of trip, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said they must have special Diet
                            session early in November and <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> must be back for several days before its
                            opening. I said I had sent several telegrams urging maximum
                            accommodation of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> plans and
                            would report <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s remarks. He
                            seemed satisfied and observed we should not be disturbed by what we read
                            in press concerning date of departure. In order forestall special
                            session they would continue announcing <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s trip as imminent.</p>
                        <p>5. He then turned to what we could do for Japan. It was not important
                            that people spoke of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> as
                            “puppet of somebody”; what was important was that they should consider
                            him “puppet of benevolent somebody.” Unfortunately many Japanese were
                            beginning to feel that US had no real benevolence toward Japan. US was
                            failing to recognize that much of Japan’s present economic difficulties
                            were attributable to mistaken occupation policies in such fields as
                            labor, decentralization of government, school reforms, etc. Since these
                            were US mistakes, US should now be more generous in helping Japan to
                            recover from them. Moreover, many Japanese are <pb xml:id="pg_1706" n="1706" facs="0650"/>coming to believe US had been far more
                            benevolent toward Germany than Japan.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> continued in this vein for
                            some time, at no place indicating either Japanese responsibilities for
                            Japanese policies in last two and half years or need for Japan to take
                            self-help measures as prior justification for US aid. I said I wished to
                            speak equally plainly and wished to point out: (a) US had found Japan in
                            ruins at end of war and had rebuilt its productivity to highest peak in
                            its history; (b) at end of occupation and under <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> plan, Japan was solvent and
                            making real economic progress; what had happened since was consequence
                            not of following occupation economic policy but of repudiating them; (c)
                            political differences between a sovereign and unified Japan and a
                            divided and occupied Germany were too obvious for comment; economic
                            differences owed to fact Germans had gone to work and Japanese had
                            wasted their substance. I added that if Japanese people still believed
                            US had not followed a benevolent policy toward Japan it could only be
                            because <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government had not
                            made effort to tell them. I also expressed surprise that Japanese people
                            could be won by purely material means. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> then said Japanese people might be better off
                            today than at war’s end but they looked back to pre-war. This was first
                            time Japan had been defeated—Germany had prior experience—and Japanese
                            people blamed America for their present bad situation. I could only
                            repeat that apparently those in government who knew better had made no
                            effort to correct this.</p>
                        <p>7. This appeared to have some effect on <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. He acknowledged that certain recent Japanese
                            economic, particularly financial, policies had been mistaken, in
                            particular the government has maintained an “import preference subsidy”
                            instead of “export preference subsidy”. He intended to have this
                            corrected immediately. He asked what we thought they should do, and I
                            replied it was necessary for Japan to draw up a specific account of what
                            measures they proposed to take to help themselves; this should cover not
                            only short-range situation but period of some years. On basis such a
                            plan we would be willing consider what we could do. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> replied he had written something
                            of sort for <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> to give to
                            President last June; he would bring it up to date and give it longer
                            range emphasis, and he wrote this carefully down in little notebook.</p>
                        <p>8. In response to my question, he said he thought about ten more
                            Progressives would follow three who left party two weeks ago. He added
                            smilingly that he “had to put his own party’s house in order before he
                            went to work on the others.”</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1707" n="1707" facs="0651"/>
                        <p>9. He did not mention <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> during
                            this conversation; he is certain to have been informed of <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>’s communication (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 350).<note n="4" xml:id="d790fn4">
                                <p>In this telegram, dated Aug. 13, the Ambassador reported
                                    that Minister <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> had
                                    informally proposed that Japan fulfill its <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> obligation by paying the
                                    United States $500 million over 20 years, interest free.</p>
                                <p>The Ambassador continued, “He said government hoped for early
                                    settlement and was inclined to favor settlement along political
                                    rather than strictly accounting lines. Apparently Foreign Office
                                    which, along with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>,
                                    had originally preferred settlement involving United States
                                    agreement to use payments in Japan for economic purposes, has
                                    now come around to Ministry of Finance position namely, that
                                    settlement should be along straight financial lines. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said government desired
                                    to separate repayment of debt from any aid program United States
                                    might agree to.” (794.5 <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/8–1354)</p>
                            </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. On leaving I handed him copy of President’s mid-year economic
                            situation report. He said he hoped we could meet frequently for this
                            kind of private conversation. I said I should look forward to our next
                            meeting and that in it I should like to ask him about <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government’s plans for dealing
                            more effectively with problem of internal subversion in Japan.</p>
                        <p>11. Implications of many of <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s
                            remarks most disturbing and have, I believe, great importance for future
                            of Japanese-American relations. I do not wish to comment at length until
                            I have had opportunity to consider matter carefully and discuss it with
                            senior members my staff. I hope to forward Embassy views early next

                            <hi rend="italic">Japanese Trade Negotiations</hi>—Dr. Hauge<note n="2" xml:id="d792fn2">Gabriel Hauge, Administrative Assistant to the
                                President.</note> reported on the review made in regard to the
                            timing of announcements for these negotiations. He set forth a proposed
                            plan for giving informal notice, about September 1st, to the Tariff
                            Commission of the intent to open negotiations, for sending a secret
                            tentative list of items to the Commission about September 15th, and for
                            issuing a public list of items in November. He noted that this
                            procedure, if approved, would carry out the earlier recommendation of
                            the Secretary of Commerce and still allow completion of negotiations by
                            the deadline of June 12th.</p>
                        <p>The President questioned the advisability of this approach in preference
                            to delaying initiation and pressing Congress in January for immediate
                            action to extend the authority given in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements
                            Act which expires in June. Dr. Hauge reported the State Department’s
                            unwillingness to rely on Congress to extend the Act. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Brownell<note n="3" xml:id="d792fn3">Herbert Brownell, Attorney General.</note> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> voiced disapproval of
                            resorting to a secret list. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> believed publication of the list would be
                            beneficial by eliminating uncertainty as to items concerned and that the
                            question would not become an election issue in any event for the
                            Democrats would not want to make it one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> believed the list would not be kept secret. Dr.
                            Hauge suggested the possibility of having the Trade Agreements Committee
                            rather than the President transmit the list to the Tariff
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that he did not want to endanger the possibility
                            of obtaining a reasonable agreement on Japanese trade by depending on
                            extension of the Act, and he recognized the possible adverse effect
                            publication of the list would have in regard to securing an extension of
                            the Act.</p>
                        <p>(Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> joined the
                            meeting at this point.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weeks</persName> stated that
                            Congressional leaders would not at all like having this matter injected
                            into the campaign. The President <pb xml:id="pg_1709" n="1709" facs="0653"/>replied concerning his dislike of any failure by
                            Congressmen to live up to their responsibilities in a matter as
                            essential to the national interest as this. The President then recounted
                            parts of the preceding discussion to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Dr. Hauge would again have the subject reviewed to
                            devise a procedure not involving transmission of the list by the

                            time. Organizationally Meyer recommends that if a decision is made to
                            sell substantial amounts of surplus agricultural products to Japan for
                            yen a small <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> Mission should be

                        <p>In recommending an agricultural surplus program of about $100 million a
                            year, the Mission took no cognizance of the limitations of sales to
                            Japan which may arise from terms of the Agricultural Trade Development
                            and Assistance Act. It is by no means assured that sales of this
                            magnitude will be feasible under those terms. The question cannot be
                            resolved until the President has issued an Executive Order governing
                            execution of the Act and until negotiations with Japan have proceeded.
                            No substantial volume of yen proceeds requiring administration could
                            accrue for some period after sales are agreed.</p>

                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, recent political developments in Japan suggest the desirability

                                position that the United States should seek a settlement along the

                                previous day that the United States considered an interest free $500

                            <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> called me in urgently this
                            afternoon to state that over week-end <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had decided he did not agree with <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement formerly proposed and
                            forwarded my 350. According to <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            said Japanese counterproposal not generous enough and not sufficiently
                            close to German settlement. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said that while Finance Ministry and Foreign
                            Office were still undecided as to final exact amount of new
                            counterproposal it would be in neighborhood of 550–600 million dollars
                            with interest 2½ percent, payments to be after five years and extend for
                            thirty years. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> showed me
                            preliminary Finance Ministry figures which included subtraction from
                            total amount on account of coal furnished Korea. I informed <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> it was my recollection that
                            United States had already subtracted this item before it submitted its
                            first proposal. It was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_DWW1">Diehl</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>
                            would discuss figures, but <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>
                            said Prime Minister wanted me to be informed at once of new proposal.
                            New proposal has two conditions:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1713" n="1713" facs="0657"/>
                        <p>First, which I understand we are prepared to agree to, is that provision
                            be made that if during period of payment Japan’s foreign exchange
                            position becomes critical, payments can be postponed by mutual
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Second, payments for initial period of five to seven years be made in yen
                            to be returned to Japan for use in economic development internally or
                            “for Southeast Asia.” <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> was
                            frank to state Burmese reparations negotiations have impressed on
                            Japanese not only necessity but difficulty of settling reparation
                            problems unless some aid was given. Burmese have maintained that
                            politically they cannot accept less than Philippines or 400 million
                            dollars. They have suggested, however, that inasmuch as Japanese
                            proposal to Philippines was 400 million dollars over twenty years,
                            Burmese might be willing to accept 200 million over ten years, inasmuch
                            as present Burmese Government has 10 year economic program which this
                            would fit into. However, for ten year period Japan would be obliged to
                            make payments to Philippines and Burma totalling 40 million dollars
                            annually. If to this sum is added an equal sum for Indonesia, Japan
                            would have to pay 60 million annually on reparations account. It is to
                            help out on this that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            thinks <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement can be
                            useful along lines suggested above. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said that if direct way of using <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> repayment to help refinance
                            reparations could not be developed, it is <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s hope that these payments in yen could be used
                            to finance internal development such as hydroelectric power, irrigation,
                            and land reclamation. He said Japanese officials would work with
                            American to ensure use of these funds would not be inflationary.</p>
                        <p>This is in essence similar to what Embassy has previously recommended and
                            I urge that most serious consideration be given to accepting this
                            condition provided that final agreed sum is satisfactory to United
                            States. If it is in United States interest, as I believe it is, to help
                            Japan reestablish normal diplomatic and economic relations with free
                            nations of Southeast Asia, I believe we here have real opportunity for
                            constructive action.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s statements are only the
                            latest and most official of a long series of incidents which shed light
                            on the true intentions and position of the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> Government. The attitude displayed, which, in
                            brutal terms, is that Japan is for sale to the highest bidder, is not
                            one which can commend itself to us as praiseworthy in any ally.</p>
                        <p>We have been assuming that Japan is potentially a strong ally and that
                            the Japanese want to assume this role as soon as their economic and
                            political situation permits. The present government has given lip
                            service to this idea but many of its actions prove otherwise. These
                            actions indicate that Japan does not consider itself an ally or partner
                            of the United States but rather a nation which for the time being is
                            forced by circumstances to cooperate with the United States but which
                            intends while doing so, to wring out of this relationship every possible
                            advantage at the minimum cost.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe we should conclude that Japan is hopeless. Rather we
                            should realize that the Japanese in spite of their modern buildings,
                            their TV sets and English-speaking leaders are still Japanese—just one
                            hundred years from feudalism. We should remember that Japanese have no
                            abstract sense of right or wrong—their guide to conduct is situational
                            and specific rather than general and ideal. As a shrewd American scholar
                            has said: “In the West we tend to build up a universalistic ethic which
                            equates all individuals in their relationship to God or to society. In
                            the Far East relationships tend to be specific”. In Japan, this same
                            author points out, “proper conduct depends upon the specific status of
                            the one man and his particular relationship to the other”.</p>
                        <p>For the United States this means, I believe, that we must realize Japan
                            has no basic convictions for or against the free world or communism. The
                            attitude toward either at any particular time depends upon specific
                            situations and upon whether in the eyes of Japanese leaders cooperation
                            with the one or the other will advance Japanese interests. It follows
                            Japanese must be convinced that ours is winning side, that any setbacks
                            in Europe or <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> do not affect this
                            fundamental fact, and that only in free world can Japanese work out
                            truly national destiny. And we must also persuade them that <pb xml:id="pg_1715" n="1715" facs="0659"/>we recognize that they are
                            primarily an Asian power and that we desire to assist them in working
                            out their position in Asia just as we have sought to recreate a position
                            for Germany in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Finally if it is true that Japanese leaders will cooperate with us only
                            if in their eyes cooperation will advance specific Japanese interests,
                            it is essential that we develop some method of making clear to the
                            Japanese that they need us at least as much if not more than we need
                            them and that this situation will continue for some time to come. Recent
                            press stories from the United States detailing the concern of the
                            American Government and people lest Japan’s economic situation force it
                            into the Communist camp have given the opposite impression. We must also
                            at all times emphasize that any aid we give Japan in the political,
                            economic or military field is forthcoming only to make up the extra
                            margin needed after Japan has done all she can for herself.</p>
                        <p>Further comments and specific suggestions for action will be forwarded in
                            response to Department’s 369.<note n="2" xml:id="d796fn2">In this

                                    had a long talk on this subject yesterday. There was no doubt in
                                    the Governor’s mind that we will have a substantial program of
                                    agricultural surpluses for Japan. Since this is the one

                                    solve its own economic problems. Since the establishment of a
                                    mission in itself could arouse undue expectations, this will
                                    require very careful handling.</p>

                        <p>Dear Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>: I refer to
                            your letter of August 5, 1954, attaching a copy of Mr. Clarence E.
                            Meyer’s report on Japan and to <pb xml:id="pg_1716" n="1716" facs="0660"/>our conversation of August 9, when you expressed the opinion that we
                            should adopt a program making available $100 million worth of raw
                            materials, principally food, each year for three years to be handled
                            through an augmented <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> organization in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Now that the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act<note n="2" xml:id="d797fn2">P.L. 480, approved July 10. (68 Stat. 455)</note>
                            is law and since an executive order under this Act will soon be issued,
                            it is appropriate to consider the expansion of the <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> organization in Japan, as the Meyer
                            report has recommended. As I understand you are now convinced that Japan
                            can procure substantial quantities of agricultural products, I am glad
                            to approve in principle the recommendations in the Meyer report.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, important to give full recognition to the complex and
                            intimate relationship between political and economic factors in Japan. I
                            am sure you agree that due to the political situation there it would be
                            unwise for the United States to take any action which would create undue
                            expectations with respect to future United States economic assistance in
                            Japan or which would, for any reason, cause the Japanese to relax their
                            own efforts to create a sound economy in the shortest possible time. I
                            feel as you do, that a small, highly competent <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> organization in Tokyo, together with the assignment of
                            Mr. Meyer, will further strengthen the efforts which the United States
                            Government has been making for several years, with considerable
                            effectiveness, to persuade the Japanese Government to take these
                            internal measures of self-help which, as the Meyer report properly
                            points out, are the prerequisites to the development of a sound economy
                            and the effective use of assistance of any sort from the United States.
                            Mr. Meyer will, of course, be informed of these political considerations
                            and of the importance of further developing interrelated political and
                            economic policies with respect to Japan.</p>
                        <p>I agree that no time should be lost in completing the steps necessary for
                            carrying out these plans. Details should, of course, be worked out with
                            the Embassy. The manner in which the move is made known to the Japanese
                            and to the public will be important politically and should be planned in
                            close cooperation between our agencies.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Secret</p>
                        <p>1. The negotiation of next year’s Japanese defense budget (and Japan’s
                            share of <gloss target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss> local costs) will bring
                            to the fore perhaps the most important decision the US has had to make
                            in Japan since the peace treaty went into effect.</p>
                        <p>2. Last year we succeeded in obtaining a moderate increase in defense
                            spending and the Japanese force goals after a major strain in our
                            relations, the exercise of strong persuasion at the highest level, and
                            the inducements of expanded <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> and the
                            prospects of additional economic aid. In June, two months after our
                            mutual understanding had been recorded in an exchange of letters with
                            the Foreign Minister, the budget (including the defense budget) was cut
                            10% without notice to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>3. This year we are already on notice that the Japanese intend to cut
                            their defense budget and to reduce their support for <gloss target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss>. This planning decision results
                            from:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. declining <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> and special
                                dollar earnings</item>
                            <item>b. Japan’s determination to maintain the outer limit of its one
                                trillion yen austerity budget;</item>
                            <item>c. Japan’s prospective assumption of <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> and reparations payments;</item>
                            <item>d. a growing feeling in Japan that the world situation has shifted
                                to a period of relaxation;</item>
                            <item>e. a gathering force of neutralism in Japan, which has increased
                                greatly in the past year and is now probably the dominant opinion in
                                the country.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>4. The force of Japanese neutralism should not be underrated. It is fed
                            by <hi rend="italic">military considerations</hi> (participation in war
                            on either side in a thermonuclear age would mean the extinction of the
                            Japanese people); by <hi rend="italic">economic</hi> (Japan suffered
                            greatly in the last war, while neutrals such as Sweden, Switzerland, and
                            India profited; Japan itself profited hugely from the Korean War); by
                                <hi rend="italic">political</hi> (a deep racial sentiment that Japan
                            should not fight against Asians on the side of Western powers); and by
                                <hi rend="italic">social</hi> (the effort to prepare for war is too
                            great; it would bring back a military ascendancy; it would <pb xml:id="pg_1718" n="1718" facs="0662"/>entrain severer domestic
                            consequences than accommodations and compromises with any potential
                            enemy).</p>
                        <p>5. It is possible that, by a major effort which would shake US–Japan
                            cooperation to its foundations, we could off-set these considerations
                            and obtain the same, or a slightly higher, level of military expenditure
                            by Japan—for another year at least. This would involve the exertion of
                            great persuasion and unquestionably a substantial increase in economic
                            aid. And the amount of persuasion and the close link between a military
                            build-up and economic aid would largely nullify the friendly benefits we
                            should expect from expanded assistance.</p>
                        <p>6. Before we make this effort which will wrench our cooperation and
                            alienate increasing numbers of Japanese—and before we decide to foot the
                            bill, one way or another, for whatever slight military increases we can
                            obtain—we should take a hard look at the practical gains and losses
                            involved. This will involve a searching examination of a number of our
                            assumptions about Japan and the Far East. Among the most important
                            questions to be asked are:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. Do we expect war with the Soviets or Chinese Communists so soon
                                as to compel the most rapid accumulation of military power at any
                                cost, economic or political? If we do, this controls the case. If we
                                think however we are in for a longer pull in which the cold war may
                                continue for decades—unless there is an accident of
                                miscalculation—then our effort should be directed more toward the
                                development of durable relationships within the non-communist world.
                                Is not our basic objective a strong, independent Japan living within
                                the diversity the free world permits?</item>
                            <item>b. To what extent have our strategic concepts for Japan been
                                refined by special weapons developments? From the strategic point of
                                view, how useful is Japan as a base for military operations? There
                                are more than fifty bases in the Soviet-Chinese–North Korean air
                                complex which can cover every industrial area in Japan with <hi rend="italic">light</hi> bombers. They similarly cover our own
                                eight air bases and three navy stations. Reduction of all these
                                Japanese areas could be accomplished with nuclear weapons in a
                                matter of minutes, not months. In the event of war, Japan as a
                                defensive base would be burdensome; as an offensive base it could
                                quickly be nullified.</item>
                            <item>c. If these conditions obtain for existing plant, what is the
                                justification for our insistence that US economic aid, <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss>, and surplus agricultural
                                counterpart should be directed exclusively toward the expansion of
                                defense industries? Does not this commit our forces to their
                                protection, reduce our flexibility, and increase our burden of
                                protecting a virtually indefensible area against enemy capture or
                                interference? If the Japanese were in position to make a more
                                substantial contribution to their own defense, the affirmative case
                                for the development of a defense industrial base in Japan would be
                                stronger. In present circumstances, and in a situation in which we
                                are inactivating defense industries in the US, the present
                                dedication <pb xml:id="pg_1719" n="1719" facs="0663"/>of economic
                                aid in Japan to defense industry seems to require
                                re-examination.</item>
                            <item>d. How feasible economically and over what period of time, are our
                                force goals for the Japanese? So far as the Embassy is aware, no
                                accurate projections of the ultimate costs of the Japanese defense
                                establishment have ever been compiled. What share of Japanese
                                national revenues will have to be devoted to the support,
                                maintenance, and renewal of Japanese ground, sea, and air forces?
                                Over the longer run, what are the assumptions of US contributions to
                                this establishment? What are the prospects for expanding Japanese
                                exports—from their present billion dollar a year
                                deficit—sufficiently to pay these costs plus: a) servicing Japan’s
                                foreign exchange obligations; b) modernizing its largely obsolescent
                                industrial plant; c) contributing to underdeveloped <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> area; d) providing food and jobs
                                for a population that is steadily increasing by million a year with
                                an annual net increase of employables of 800,000; e) paying <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> reparations and other World
                                War II external obligations?</item>
                            <item>e. How practical is it to continue our support and our advocacy of
                                expanded and modern military forces and an industrial mobilization
                                base in a country where the most rudimentary internal security
                                controls have yet to be established? No legal definitions of
                                treason, espionage, or state secrets exist. The communist party, the
                                communist fronts, and communist labor unions are all legal,
                                flourishing, and unmolested. No program of protection against
                                industrial sabotage has ever been discussed. So primitive is the

                        <p>7. These are not questions which can be answered in a day. If the
                            Secretary approves, the Embassy would propose to initiate a study of
                            them, jointly with other US agencies in Japan, with a view to submitting
                            a reappraisal of our Japan position prior to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s arrival in Washington.</p>
                        <p>8. This reappraisal would necessarily include an examination of an
                            alternative course of action. The premise would be defense against
                            attack from <hi rend="italic">within</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">without</hi> as at present. It would require a shift in the
                            emphasis of our policy over the immediate period ahead from defense to
                            economics and internal security. We would then seek to use economic
                            aid—or Japan’s foreign exchange obligations to us—to promote the
                            reintroduction of Japan into the world trading community, to solve the
                            reparations deadlock and foster <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                            economic regionalism, and to modernize Japan’s industries. We would
                            insist that the Japanese Government deal effectively with the problem of
                            internal security, the communist manipulated <pb xml:id="pg_1720" n="1720" facs="0664"/>press, the leftist-controlled schools. We
                            would seek to assist in creating a stronger Japanese government at home
                            and in increasing the prestige and participation of Japan in Asian and
                            world affairs.</p>
                        <p>9. This would involve, for some years, an acquiescence in the military
                            impotence or neutralization of Japan. But until a stronger Japanese
                            Government comes into being, until there is a recovery of national
                            spirit and purpose, until Japan’s international economic position is
                            considerably improved, and until there is an effective internal security
                            system, this acquiescence would be no more than a recognition of the
                            facts of the situation. It would mean, once again, that given a rough
                            balance of (atomic) power, what we are striving to develop is the
                            strength of the non-communist world, not the maximum military forces in
                            being that they can build. We do not follow such a course ourselves.</p>
                        <p>10. Out of such a shift in our policies should come a stronger and, very
                            possibly, a more cooperative Japan. Unless there is such a Japan our
                            military assistance program will have no future. We should not of course
                            abandon our military aid program, but we should limit it to what the
                            Japanese decide they wish to have and we should be prepared to proceed
                            with the relocation of the Far East Command and the withdrawal of our
                            forces on whatever schedule the US national interest alone dictates.
                            Paradoxically, for Japan, the absence of US insistence that Japan
                            increase its military forces and the conviction that the US has only a
                            secondary strategic interest in Japan may do more to establish valid and
                            reciprocal defense commitments than any other course of action we might
                            select.</p>

                            long felt that Japan has been able to do a great deal more than she
                            seems willing to commit herself to accomplish. I feel that a ground
                            force consisting of 10 active divisions, backed by 5 additional reserve
                            divisions fully organized and trained, would be adequate for the ground
                            defense of Japan, provided this force is properly supported by air and
                            naval elements. Japan now has 4 divisions. A 5th division is presently
                            being formed. Japan has a commitment to raise a 6th division by 31 March
                            1955, a commitment made in the exchange of diplomatic notes on 6 April
                            1954. In that exchange, the United States agreed in good faith to a
                            reduction of $7,000,000 in the amount of the Japanese contribution to
                            the support of United States forces in Japan on the condition that,
                            among other things, Japan would augment her ground forces to 6 divisions
                            by 31 March 1955.</p>
                        <p>The present trend of events, however, indicates that Japan will probably
                            not meet the commitment for the development of forces which she made in
                            the agreement mentioned above. Japanese officials are now publicly
                            stating that it will be necessary for Japan to reduce by 10% the size of
                            the forces that will be raised this year. If this reduction is placed in
                            effect, I believe the United States should view it as a wholly
                            unsatisfactory degree of fulfillment of the agreement between the two
                            countries and as a basis for possible renegotiation of the agreed
                            reduction in the amount of the Japanese contribution to the support of
                            United States forces in Japan.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Necessity for Japanese Planning Prior to United
                                States Commitment of Support</hi> The United States is in a
                            difficult position with respect to the support of Japanese military
                            forces because the United States Congress wishes to appropriate funds
                            for assistance only after assurance is received that the Japanese will
                            raise the specified forces for which the American assistance is
                            required. On the other hand, the Japanese wish to make their plans only
                            after they know what assistance the United States will provide. It would
                            be of tremendous assistance in the common effort if the Japanese
                            Government would approve some long range plan for its own military
                            services and would confirm its intention of providing for their support.
                            Admittedly, the Japanese military forces are subject to appropriations
                            by their own government, but without a willingness on the part of the
                            Japanese Government to program forces at least a year in advance and
                            then support those forces, we cannot develop supply deficiencies upon
                            which to base requests for United States appropriations. The United
                            States Mutual Defense Assistance Programs <pb xml:id="pg_1722" n="1722" facs="0666"/>have considerable flexibility and can usually be
                            modified through reprogramming to meet variations in programmed Japanese
                            military forces caused by modifications made by the Japanese Government
                            in its legislative and appropriation processes provided the program was
                            initially considered reasonable by our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> representatives.</p>

                            Minister has sought our comments on his plan for the development of the
                            Japanese National Defense Highway System. The United States Army
                            engineers have furnished representation on a joint US-Japan Technical
                            Committee which has developed a desirable Japanese defense highway
                            network. The estimated cost is $913,552,000. So far, the Japanese have
                            not developed a plan for financing this construction. It is probable
                            that the Prime Minister will ask for these funds on his visit to the
                            United States. The representatives of the Far East Command assisted in
                            developing a plan for a desirable highway system for defense without
                            consideration of the desirability of such a highway system to the
                            Japanese economy. They have not committed the United States in any
                            manner.</p>

                            policy to utilize offshore procurement only for the valid end item
                            requirements of forces which are either in existence or definitely
                            programmed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> visualizes
                            United States procurement in quantities five times as great as will
                            probably be justified by the forces that will be raised. For example,
                            his “normal annual requirement” of the Japanese Defense Forces is stated
                            as $207,000,000 in offshore procurement, whereas, considering valid end
                            item requirements, we would expect to provide only on the order of 25%
                            of that amount in offshore procurement. It is important to make clear to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> that United States
                            military aid funds will be forthcoming only in support of forces
                            actually in existence or programmed and not for the primary purpose of
                            economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Japanese Leadership in the Far East</hi> Japan
                            possesses many qualities, potential and otherwise, which fit her to
                            assume a role of leadership in the Far East in the fight against
                            Communism. Japan should be brought to the realization that the
                            fulfillment of this leadership role should be her ultimate aim. It is my
                            belief that the United States would like Japan to assume the leadership
                            among anti-Communist forces in the Far East. This will require a
                            considerable <pb xml:id="pg_1723" n="1723" facs="0667"/>effort on the
                            part of Japan. It has been my hope that knowledge that the US will
                            withdraw its forces from Japan as soon as it can safely do so would
                            inspire the Japanese to expend an adequate effort on their rearmament
                            program. Certainly, as an interim objective, Japan must first rearm
                            sufficiently to provide for her own defense. She must next strive to
                            gain the confidence of her neighbors and be prepared to make a
                            substantial contribution to the defense of the regional area of which
                            she is a part.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in
                            Japan he had had lengthy meetings with Premier <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and Foreign Minister Okasaki,
                            and a separate talk with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had explained
                            U.S. redeployment policy and, as far as he could judge, <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> seemed to understand it and
                            accept it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the
                            talks had indicated that economic matters were of considerable concern
                            to the Japanese. The Japanese economic situation actually is improved,
                            because of their austerity program and their good crop this year. They
                            have almost enough rice for domestic consumption. In fact, the Chinese
                            Nationalists were complaining that the Japanese were not buying Formosan
                            rice. The Japanese trade deficit last year was about $1.1 billion. It is
                            expected to be considerably less this year, and may be <pb xml:id="pg_1725" n="1725" facs="0669"/>manageable if Japan can find
                            some export markets in Southeast Asia. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> frankly that Japan should not expect to find a
                            big U.S. market because the Japanese don’t make the things we want.
                            Japan must find markets elsewhere for the goods they export.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the big
                            problem economically for Japan at present is the question of
                            reparations, particularly with the Philippines, Indonesia, and Burma. He
                            had told <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> that this
                            presented a real dilemma, since that Japanese economy can’t stand
                            sizeable reparations but can’t be built up without a reparations
                            settlement. He suggested that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> try to accept a reasonable settlement such as
                            the recent Burmese offer, which appeared to be a reasonable proposal.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> assured Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in the most emphatic
                            terms that the outward evidence of anti-Americanism was not truly the
                            feeling of the Japanese people. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he feels no doubt that the Communists
                            are making progress on that campaign, however.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the
                            belief that we may have to lower our sights on Japanese rearmament. We
                            must measure the value of military forces in being against the political
                            support as to how and when they may be used. He feels that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> agree. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> recently made a trip to
                            Hokaido, where he observed the air facilities being built on a series of
                            islands in the Kuriles. There were 50 MIG’s on the nearest island, and
                            if the buildup continues at its present rate the Russians will have more
                            air power there than our entire Far East Air Force. The President
                            commented that while we had spent many months arguing about the
                            responsibility for losing China, we had just given away the Kuriles. He
                            said he had never understood why in the name of God we did it, and that
                            he thought it constituted the “damnedest stupidity”.</p>
                        <p>In answer to the Attorney General’s question whether Japan would need
                            rice from Indochina, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            said that he did not believe so, although Japan was buying a little rice
                            from Pakistan and Thailand. In answer to the President’s question, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said some progress
                            was being made in persuading the Japanese to eat wheat. In answer to the
                            Vice President’s question regarding the impression Magsaysay<note n="4" xml:id="d801fn4">Ramon Magsaysay, President of the
                                Philippines.</note> made on the other people at the Manila meeting,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he saw
                            more of Magsaysay than the others, who did not get a chance to have an
                            adequate impression. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that Magsaysay had told him how he,
                            Magsaysay, had dealt with the Communists, and that it would make your
                            hair stand on end.</p>

                            reaches you, you may have heard of an Embassy memo dated Sept. 9th,
                            copies of which we gave to <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">Doug

                                O’Connor</persName>. This memo is our preliminary effort at a local
                            “new look” at our policies and tactics in Japan. In case the text has
                            not yet reached you via the officers mentioned, I am enclosing two
                            copies.</p>
                        <p>I should like to repeat that this memo is preliminary. It represents a
                            synthesis of views expressed on the morning of the 9th at a meeting in
                            the Ambassador’s office attended by Jerry Higgins,<note n="2" xml:id="d802fn2">Apparently Maj. Gen. Gerald Higgins, Chief of the

                            Duke Diehl Bill Leonhart and myself. A remarkable aspect of the meeting
                            was that the views expressed from the various viewpoints of the
                            speakers—political, economic, military, etc.—were so consonant with each
                            other. The result was that we all readily concurred and the Ambassador
                            approved the memo which Bill Leonhart put together with his usual speed
                            and skill.</p>
                        <p>A copy of this memo was given to General Magruder on the 10th at the
                            close of our Embassy meeting, which he attended, with the Secretary and
                            his principal advisors. I expect tomorrow to learn his reaction. We have
                            commenced active studies in pursuance of the line of thinking set forth
                            in the memo and have set as a tentative target October 1 for drafting a
                            more definitive paper on the views <pb xml:id="pg_1727" n="1727" facs="0671"/>of the Embassy, the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, and, I hope, <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> (to
                            the extent that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> wishes to
                            contribute).</p>
                        <p>We have been encouraged to undertake this venture by the reception
                            accorded to the memo by the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">Doug
                                MacArthur</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Bill
                                Sebald</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_OCRL1">Rod
                                O’Connor</persName>, all of whom read it while in Tokyo. The
                            Secretary indicated at our meeting that he would like us to pursue our
                            thinking further along these lines and he did not take issue with any of
                            the points made. In fact, in talking to us, he said a number of things
                            which paralleled the general tenor of the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>I hope this exercise will prove helpful and that we will complete it well
                            before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> arrives in
                            Washington. In the meantime, I hope you will not be shocked by the new
                            slant to our thoughts. There is one matter of importance not treated in
                            the memo, namely, what attitude we should take towards the continuance
                            in office of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>. We will
                            handle that separately but I think we here are increasingly of the view
                            that we would welcome his elevation to the role of senior statesman and
                            adviser somewhat after the manner of the old Genro.</p>

                            theme was chosen by the Japanese, presumably by pre-arrangement. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> said that it was
                            extremely difficult even for well-informed Japanese to assess recent
                            domestic political developments. The significance of the <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> statement is being variously interpreted. He
                            illustrated the point further by describing his recent conversations
                            with three highly placed Japanese, one of whom interpreted the recent
                            trend as indicating that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> would be forced out of office before the end of
                            the year; the other as indicating the probable retention of power by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> beyond the first of
                            the year. The third said that he didn’t know what to expect. To Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> the significant item
                            was that none of the three even mentioned the possibility of Diet
                            dissolution and an election.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> then launched into a
                            long history of the Surrender Cabinet and the role which he and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> played in the Central
                            Liaison Office. He implied that he at that time was a <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> man. Throughout this
                            conversation it seemed that <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> wished to convey the information that he still
                            regards himself as somewhat detached from the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> regime whereas, so he said, <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> was now too closely identified
                            with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>. The freedom with
                            which he spoke of this in front of the others, added to Mr. Nakagawa’s
                            aside to Mr. Morgan that it really didn’t matter from a U.S. point of
                            view whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> retained
                            power or yielded to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName>
                            or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName>, gave the impression
                            that the prevailing view in the Foreign Office might be similar to that
                            of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> noted, almost with an
                            air of approval, that the U.S. had not given any presents to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> this time, at which
                            point the conversation turned to the significance of the Department’s
                            statement of April 1953 which, one of the American officers ventured,
                            had perhaps not had any real influence on the outcome of the election
                            except perhaps to cause resentment because of the apparent intervention.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> disagreed, saying
                            that the statement was taken by the Japanese people as a very clear
                            indication that the U.S. was backing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and many then voted for him because of that
                            backing. It seemed significant that in discussing the lack of presents
                            for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, no mention was
                            made of the imminent establishment of a USOM in Japan or of the
                            suggested <pb xml:id="pg_1731" n="1731" facs="0675"/>top-level committee

                                Treaty Bureau in the Foreign Ministry.</note> had approached Mr.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> said there were many
                            rumors of difficulty at the time of the Prime Minister’s departure on
                                Sunday,<note n="7" xml:id="d805fn7">Sept. 26. The Prime Minister
                                stopped first in Canada and then sailed for Europe from New York on
                                Sept. 29. On Nov. 2 he arrived back in New York to begin his
                                official visit to the United States.</note> which could include the
                            possibility of labor picket lines attempting to prevent the Prime
                            Minister from reaching the airport and also American and other diplomats
                            from seeing him off. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName>’
                            remark that all the United States was interested in was keeping the
                            gates open was not picked up. The further suggestions that it might be
                            well for the Prime Minister to proceed to the airport by helicopter,
                            landing in the middle of the field, or that he leave from Atsugi, were
                            received with surprising good humor by the Japanese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> said he thought he would get
                            off on schedule, that he really must do so and that it had to be from
                            Haneda.</p>
                        <p>It seemed to be the consensus of the Japanese side that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s visit to the U.S. would be of
                            a ceremonial character only and there was little expectation that
                            anything of major importance would be accomplished.</p>

                        <p>My Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName>: With respect
                            to our conversation on the Embassy study to be prepared<note n="1" xml:id="d806fn1">See <ref target="#d818">Document 818</ref>.</note>
                            in accordance with the memorandum for the Secretary prepared by the
                            Embassy and dated September 9, 1954, I have asked Major General Elmer J.
                            Rogers, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, to assist whomever you
                            designate to prepare the study.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1732" n="1732" facs="0676"/>
                        <p>I have set forth below the additional views I hold that are most in
                            disagreement with the Embassy memorandum:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. The effect of enemy atomic attack is over-stated.</item>
                            <item>2. No government can be strong which is not prepared to defend
                                itself. The degree with which the Japanese on Hokkaido cooperate
                                with the Russians is an indication of the degree to which all Japan
                                would probably cooperate with Russia if U.S. forces were withdrawn
                                and Japanese forces were not prepared to defend the country.</item>
                            <item>3. The conception of making Japan rich before we make her
                                militarily strong would only weaken the moral fiber of her people
                                and delay indefinitely Japan’s achieving the ability to defend her
                                own interests.</item>
                            <item>4. Making Japan rich before we make her militarily strong would
                                make her a more desirable prize to the Russians.</item>
                            <item>5. General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> has
                                considered the withdrawal of U.S. forces before Japan is fully able
                                to defend itself only as a measure to in fluence Japan to rearm,
                                never with “an acquiescence in the military impotence or
                                neutralization of Japan”.</item>
                            <item>6. If we cannot inculcate in Japan a spirit, such as now motivates
                                Germany to rise from defeat into a position of power and leadership,
                                then Japan should be protected from Russian capture by U.S. troops
                                but it would be a waste of money to invest in Japan more funds than
                                those essential for the prevention of disease in epidemic
                                proportions and the prevention of unrest that would threaten the
                                security of our own garrison.</item>
                            <item>7. Before we accept a defeatist approach, I feel we should
                                endeavor in every way to kindle in Japan a more aggressive spirit
                                such as, for example: by urging the Japanese Government to establish
                                itself more strongly with respect to Japan itself, by actively
                                seeking the replacement of the present Japanese Government if it is
                                unable to take a stronger grasp on Japan’s affairs; by discontinuing
                                economic aid so that Japan has to struggle for her livelihood and
                                therefore feel the need of military power in supporting her
                                commercial ventures such as fishing in the waters off the Kurile
                                Islands and Korea; by urging Japan again to seek a position of
                                leadership in Northeast Asia; by seeking to arrange a Northeast Asia
                                pact in which Japan would be the leader and even by indicating that
                                the United States would view favorably the re-establishment of the
                                Japanese Empire under a moderate Japanese Government.</item>

                        <p>1. Lieutenant Colonel J.L. Hansen, <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                            General Medical Laboratory, and past president Japan-America Pathology
                            Association, who observed Kuboyama autopsy and examined case record last
                            night made following report to me today:</p>
                        <p>2. Although findings cannot be conclusive until microscopic analyses
                            made, Kuboyama died apparently of hepatorenal syndrome accompanied in
                            terminal stages by upper lobar pneumonia and diffuse pulmonary
                            edema.</p>
                        <p>3. This syndrome characteristic of serum hepatitis which patient
                            developed ninety days after first six blood and dried plasma
                            transfusions. Patient had jaundice in his own youth, and cause of death
                            of two brothers officially listed as hepatitis.</p>
                        <p>4. During course autopsy, no significant radiation effects observable,
                            although some residual depilation and scar tissue externally visible.
                            (These were repeatedly photographed by reporters and press cameramen who
                            packed autopsy chamber.) Bone marrow was healthy and generative; red
                            blood corpuscles in femur area more than normal for man younger than
                            patient; cranium and spinal column unaffected. All organs were measured
                            by Geiger counter and no significant readings obtained.</p>
                        <p>5. Hansen asked for tissue specimens. Doctor Tsuzuki thought this
                            possible later, but last night “too many reporters present”. Hansen
                            believes he can obtain specimens on personal basis. He will make full
                            report his findings to me.</p>
                        <p>6. For our own information, would appreciate information whether blood or
                            plasma transfusions given exposed Marshallese with or without jaundice

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">Bob</persName>: The enclosed memorandum
                            is self-explanatory. It was drafted by Andy Kerr who was chairman on the
                            United States side at the meeting in question. Also present for the
                            Embassy were Duke Diehl and Van Swearingen.<note n="1" xml:id="d809fn1">Jay Allen Van Swearingen, an Economic Officer in the
                                Embassy.</note> Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SWB1">Smith</persName>
                            (J–4) represented the Headquarters, and Brigadier General Moore

                        <p>Andy and Duke reported this incident immediately, of course, to me and
                            the Ambassador. While the Ambassador was still considering what action
                            to take—for example, a stiff representation to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>—<persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> paid an official call on the Ambassador to
                            present an expression of regret over the <hi rend="italic">Toya
                                Maru</hi> disaster.<note n="2" xml:id="d809fn2">In the <hi rend="italic">Toya Maru</hi> ferry boat disaster late in

                                their lives.</note> The Ambassador decided to take this opportunity
                            to read the riot act to <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>.
                            I will not attempt to summarize at secondhand the <pb xml:id="pg_1736" n="1736" facs="0680"/>points made by the Ambassador in expressing
                            his views of this extraordinary variety of “diplomacy”, except for the
                            following reference to the <hi rend="italic">Toya Maru</hi> disaster.
                            The Ambassador informed <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>
                            that American newsmen in Tokyo had proposed to him that, following the
                            precedent established by the Japanese Government in the <hi rend="italic">Fukuryu Maru</hi> case, the United States Government
                            should demand compensation, and he pointed to the respects in which the
                            two incidents were parallel: The <hi rend="italic">Toya Maru</hi>
                            disaster was apparently due to neglect on the part of the Japanese
                            Government, and approximately 56 American lives were lost, although
                            there was no question in either case of ill intent. The Ambassador
                            added, of course, that he had no thought then of taking this position
                            publicly.</p>
                        <p>The interview lasted almost an hour, and the Ambassador reports that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>’s response left
                            nothing to be desired. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>
                            indicated, for example, that he had promptly retracted his accusation of
                            bad faith when challenged by Andy Kerr. He protested his friendship for
                            the United States and pointed to the fact that he had taken the
                            initiative in setting up a series of bimonthly off-therecord meetings
                            between Bureau Chiefs in the Foreign Office and senior Embassy personnel
                            for frank, cordial, and off-the-record discussions.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador has decided to let the matter rest, at least until a
                            similar transgression is repeated. Distribution of the enclosed five
                            copies of the memorandum is left to your discretion.</p>
                        <p>Because various other Japanese agencies—Finance, <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>, Defense, etc.—were represented at this official
                            meeting, we have decided that Andy should make a statement at the next
                            meeting of the group that is calculated to serve notice to these other
                            Japanese Government agencies that such tactics are neither advisable nor
                            condoned. It is possible that <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> himself may say something in the spirit of
                            retraction, and if so, Andy will tailor his statement accordingly.</p>

                                meeting was described by the Embassy in telegram 363 from Tokyo,
                                    <ref target="#d789">Document 789</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> unexpectedly raised again the
                            question of utilization of the $40 million of yen proceeds arising from
                            sales of wheat and barley under Section 550 of the Mutual Security Act.
                            He repeated the proposition that the <gloss target="#t_JG1">JG</gloss>
                            had been given firm assurance during the negotiations that offshore
                            procurement in Japan during USFY 1954 would total $100 million so that
                            payments would amount to $60 million in dollars and $40 million in yen
                            whereas only $70 million worth of contracts had been placed. He
                            indicated that these Section 550 purchases would not have been
                            acceptable to Japan if it had been known that offshore procurement would
                            total only $70 million.</p>
                        <p>I explained again that the estimate of $100 million was not a commitment
                            but only a target, that in fact it is impossible to make a firm
                            commitment concerning the volume of offshore procurement because of
                            various factors. On the US side, for example, after appropriations are
                            made, there is need for provisional division of the total procurement
                            program between Stateside and offshore, provisional division of the
                            worldwide offshore procurement program on a country-by-country and
                            item-by-item basis, determination of a pricing policy for procurement in
                            Japan, and issuance of purchase authorizations to US procurement
                            agencies in Japan. By the time such US actions have been completed, the
                            US fiscal year is well advanced and the actual volume of contracts that
                            can be placed in Japan during the time that remains depends upon such
                            factors as price, quality and delivery dates. Thus, failure to achieve
                            the target figure of $100 million in USFY 1954 was due in part to
                            factors on the US side causing delay and in part to factors on the
                            Japanese side (notably price) which prevented placement of contracts
                            after purchase authorizations were finally received.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> stated that he was
                            thoroughly familiar with this explanation, having listened to it to the
                            point of weariness. He then proceeded to accuse the US of bad faith by
                            advancing the fantastic charge that the. US had never intended to
                            achieve the $100 million target for offshore procurement in Japan. He
                            stated that the US must have known by the time of signing the
                            surplus-purchase <pb xml:id="pg_1738" n="1738" facs="0682"/>agreement
                            (March 8) that achievement of this target would not be possible. He said
                            he realized that the US had not committed itself in legal terms to
                            achieve this target, that in fact “US negotiators are very clever in
                            devising legal language that permits escape from what is regarded by the
                            naive Japanese negotiators as a binding commitment.”</p>
                        <p>Referring to the <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>
                            talks in Washington in the fall of 1953, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> expressed confidence in his knowledge of the
                            English language and stated that there could not be the slightest doubt
                            that the $100 million “Commitment” had also been made at that time. He
                            expressed the opinion that, during these talks as well as during
                            subsequent negotiations concerning the $50 million purchase of US
                            surplus agricultural commodities, the naive Japanese negotiators had
                            been taken in by the Americans who are adept at sharp practices which
                            enable them to advance apparent commitments which they have no intention
                            of keeping. He expressed regret that he had not been permitted to
                            participate in these talks (except as an observer), implying that he
                            would not have been so easily fooled.</p>
                        <p>He implied that, in all future negotiations with the US, it behooved the
                            Japanese side to be on guard and take care to leave no loopholes in any
                            agreement because the good faith of the US cannot be taken for granted.
                            In effect, he served notice to the US officials present that they would
                            find him much less easy to hoodwink than the Japanese negotiators during
                            the <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> talks in Washington or the
                            Japanese negotiators of the $50 million surplus-purchase agreement.</p>
                        <p>The US representatives at the meeting were officials of the Embassy and
                            of the Far East Command who are charged with responsibility for seeking
                            to maximize the volume of US contracts placed in Japan in order to
                            strengthen the Japanese economy in general and to expand Japan’s defense
                            production industries in particular. It is hardly necessary to point out
                            that it is primarily Japan’s interest that is served by placement of
                            these contracts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>’s
                            tactics were hardly calculated to encourage the US in its efforts to
                            maximize the volume of offshore procurement in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The US officials present were shocked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName>’s fantastic charges against the US as well as
                            by the nasty manner in which he presented these charges. Throughout his
                            outburst, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TR1">Takeuchi</persName> exhibited
                            obvious hostility to the US. Such tactics are least expected from a
                            high-ranking diplomatic official who is charged with conduct of US
                            affairs.</p>

                            which was prepared by Embassy Tokyo and discussed with you in Tokyo by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>. The principal
                            points of this memorandum are:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. To persuade the Japanese to make a greater budget expenditure
                                for defense in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 55–56 will
                                require a major effort which could greatly strain United
                                States–Japan relations.</item>
                            <item>b. Our decision on this issue must be made in the light of growing
                                neutralism in Japan, our estimates as to the imminence of war with
                                the Soviet Union or Communist China, our strategic concepts for
                                Japan in view of nuclear developments, the value of a large
                                mobilization base in Japan, Japan’s economic weakness and lack of
                                internal security.</item>
                            <item>c. The Embassy recommends that our policy toward Japan be
                                reappraised and that we seek to emphasize economic strength and
                                internal security rather than developments of Japan’s defense
                                capabilities.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> is in general agreement with Embassy
                            Tokyo’s excellent memorandum but does not think that it represents as
                            sharp a departure from existing policy as the Embassy apparently does.
                            We have the following specific comments:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. Overemphasis by us on Japanese defense measures could easily be
                                self-defeating. The United States should continue its policy of
                                negotiating on the basis of what the Japanese themselves propose in
                                the way of defense measures, attempting of course to expand the
                                Japanese effort where feasible but without going so far as to strain
                                our relations.</item>
                            <item>b. Japan’s defense plans for the next fiscal year provide for a
                                modest increase of Japan’s defense forces, although the defense
                                budget is not scheduled to be increased. We believe that agreement
                                on our part to accept a sizeable reduction of Japan’s contribution
                                to the support of United States forces, presently $148,000,000,
                                might help us to get a comparable Japanese budgetary increase which
                                would finance a reasonable increment of Japan’s forces. However,
                                this will probably require some pressure by us.</item>
                            <item>c. Economic development and internal security are essential for
                                Japan and should be given higher priority in the review of our <pb xml:id="pg_1743" n="1743" facs="0687"/>basic policy toward Japan
                                shortly to be undertaken than they have in the present policy
                                paper.</item>
                            <item>d. Japanese reluctance to take stronger internal security measures
                                should not be underestimated. Pressure by us on the Japanese to do
                                more about internal leftism and anti-Americanism could be
                                self-defeating, as has to some extent been the case with our efforts
                                to force stronger defense measures, and would be used by Japanese
                                critics to show we have no interest in the progress of democracy in
                                Japan.</item>
                            <item>e. Our estimates as to the imminence of war and the effect of
                                nuclear developments on our strategic concepts are obviously
                                important factors in appraising Japan’s defense effort. These
                                considerations would not however appear to suggest any diminution of
                                Japan’s effort or modification of our plans to assist Japan’s
                                military build-up to the extent practicable.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> states that
                            Embassy Tokyo is now drafting a suggested reappraisal of United States
                            policy toward Japan along the lines of paragraph one above. The
                            Ambassador has indicated he desires to discuss this reappraisal should
                            he return to Washington later this month in connection with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s visit.</p>
                        <p>4. I suggest that in any discussion with the Ambassador on this subject
                            you may wish to stress the considerations set forth in paragraph two
                            above. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> has seen and
                            concurred in the comments given in paragraph two.</p>

                        <p>1. Estimate <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s performance
                            and utility for achievement our objectives, his political strength and
                            likely alternatives essential to decisions for handling <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>. In our view <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> seeking strengthen position Japan probably with

                        <p>2. Re performance <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> has

                        <p>3. Alternatives to <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            unimpressive. <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> most likely
                            but his strongly conservative views probably implemented by inflationist
                            Ishibashi less conducive US interests particularly in fields economics
                            and international cooperation than continuation <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> policies. <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName> as indicated your 690<note n="3" xml:id="d812fn3">Dated Sept. 22, not printed. (794.00/9–2254)</note>
                            appears real possibility and from US point of view probably most
                            desirable but doubt he has strength and stature remain long as Prime
                            Minister. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> equally good but
                            his chances appear less promising. Other leading conservatives like
                            Kishi or <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> appear
                            undesirable.</p>

                                not printed. (794.00/9–2054)</note> indicates <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> remains politically strong in
                            which estimate we generally concur. If opposition should dethrone
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> by nonconfidence vote
                            he likely dissolve Diet and force election in which we do not foresee
                            conservative opposition as able muster sufficient strength attain
                            majority or effective plurality. Only Socialists likely to profit
                            substantially and new general election probable after short time. This
                            confused situation unlikely further US interests.</p>
                        <p>5. Not sure how much our assistance would help <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> or conversely our refraining from assistance
                            might hurt him. On balance believe preferable if press release at close
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> visit, although
                            emphasizing US-Japanese friendship not US support for <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, contain practical evidence
                            which could be cited among conservatives and important business circles
                            as US support of Japan. Believe this would serve important US objective
                            by assisting <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> in ability

                                    793</ref>.</note> in the recommendation from the Embassy and the
                            Far East Command that a joint consultative group be established at a
                            high level with the Japanese to consider implementation of the Military
                            Assistance Agreement and broad strategic questions. He said the question
                            now was what kinds of things could be taken up in the committee which
                            would improve Japan’s understanding of the world picture and thus
                            improve their cooperation in security matters. He added that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> had suggested that
                            this item be discussed in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> expressed that

                            communication were adequate and that he had also been able to get to the
                            Japanese leaders the kind of information which was needed. New
                            instructions did not appear to be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> said that he saw

                            <item>1. To be of any real use the questions discussed would have to be
                                at a level that even an Ambassador or a General could not very well
                                go into.</item>
                            <item>2. Such an arrangement might strengthen Japan’s demands for

                            <item>3. Such an arrangement might cause adverse reactions on the part
                                of other countries in the area with whom such an arrangement did not

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthur</persName> pointed out that we
                            do, in fact, have such arrangements with other Asian countries in
                            connection with our security treaties with them.</p>

                            the view that there was no need to disclose classified information to
                            the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthur</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DEF1">Drumright</persName> explained that there were
                            many matters which were either not classified, or not highly classified,
                            which could be discussed with the Japanese, and that they would carry
                            much more weight if done at a high level than if they read them in the
                            newspapers. They suggested, however, that the matter could await the
                            actual establishment of the committee and views of our representatives
                            in Tokyo before it had to be considered further.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that no action would be taken for the present and that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> might wish to
                            discuss it upon his arrival in the next few weeks.</p>

                        <p>[1.] So long as opponents unable to get together on a successor, I am not
                            ready to agree that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> is
                            about through although he will face major Diet crisis November. However,
                            lack of alternative is now almost sole important reason for his
                            political viability.</p>
                        <p>2. New serious elements of weakness have been added to debit side since
                            June Diet riots, to wit:</p>
                        <p>(1) Increasing tendency of financial and industrial leaders to withhold
                            monetary support and agree time has come to force <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> out;</p>
                        <p>(2) Ever greater reliance on Palace guard (particularly unpopular
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>) because so many others
                            now intriguing regarding alternatives instead of sticking staunchly with
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>. Contracting circle of
                            the faithful is gradually isolating him. (In view importance business
                            leaders’ attitudes, am lunching Tuesday<note n="2" xml:id="d814fn2">Oct.

                        <pb xml:id="pg_1747" n="1747" facs="0691"/>
                        <p>Last major positive element of strength (as opposed to negative one of
                            Conservative disunity) is lingering belief <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> better than anyone can obtain American support
                            for Japan. Even this double-edged because of deeply-rooted Japanese
                            instinct for freedom from foreigners. Current trip is, of course,
                            crucial from this point of view. To date, I think trip has worked in his
                            favor because it has given Japan new prestige abroad (at least in eyes
                            of Japanese who have been outcasts so long). But brilliant reversal of
                            his fortunes extremely unlikely unless we hazard effort to do this for
                            him. In my view, this would be both unwise and expensive.</p>
                        <p>It is Japanese themselves who must achieve long-term political stability;
                            selection of their leaders must be left to them. If and when crisis
                            comes, Conservatives will come together in rough proportion to
                            seriousness of crisis. They are too hard-headed not to assert their
                            dominance which is bolstered by money, by a near monopoly of experience
                            in governing, by Japanese feudal respect for authority, by peasant
                            conservatism and by lack of mass Communist-inclined base as in France or
                            Italy. It is, therefore, not necessary to conclude that if <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> goes, something much worse for
                            US will inevitably emerge. Also, even though scandals, et cetera, have
                            probably increased electoral strength Socialists, I doubt that
                            Conservatives have been weakened to point where they could not muster
                            majority or plurality, as reference telegram suggests, in an early
                            election.</p>
                        <p>View foregoing, although no one can be sure, I am increasingly of opinion
                            that statement made in paragraph 9 of enclosure to Embassy despatch
                                1641<note n="3" xml:id="d814fn3">The enclosure is an Embassy study
                                prepared in anticipation of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s (cancelled) June visit.
                                (611.94/6–754)</note> correct namely that “broader-based
                            Conservative government without <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> (or with him in elder statesman role) is
                            preferable in terms of US interests to continuation of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> as head of weaker government”.
                            My principal qualification on this is that immaturity of Japanese
                            political parties and system is such that there is relatively greater
                            dependence than in West upon a leader who commands respect. Failures of
                            present government have been more apparent and more detrimental to US
                            interests since foregoing was written. This too is supported by Embassy
                            studies pursuant to my memorandum of September 9 to Secretary. But I am
                            all more convinced that as Embassy despatch states “our policy should be
                            one of studied neutrality in which we neither go out of way to help
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> stay in office or to
                            oust him”. In other words, intervention in my view is dangerous and not
                            warranted, at least not now. This does not mean, however, that we should
                            forego any opportunity to stress to Japanese advantages, in fact
                            imperative <pb xml:id="pg_1748" n="1748" facs="0692"/>necessity, of
                            Conservative unity in Japan’s own interest both external and internal.
                            We should constantly say that it is none of our affair by whom Japan is
                            governed, that the important thing is that the country be governed.</p>
                        <p>In light of foregoing, I am in agreement with that part of paragraph 5 of
                            reference telegram which prescribes a final <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> visit communiqué designed to stress our interest
                            in Japan, especially in Japanese “self-support” programs, and am not in
                            agreement with implication in same paragraph that we should somehow
                            conspire to help <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> choose
                            his successor. In my view, we should suit our actions to developments
                            and only where clearly appropriate take steps to ease and shorten period
                            of Japan’s readjustment of her internal affairs, desirable as this
                            objective is.</p>

                            and joint action. This is most interesting statement revealing as it
                            does Japanese official belief that United States pressure for defense
                            build-up has been counter-productive. Essence of statement is that if
                            pressure is <pb xml:id="pg_1749" n="1749" facs="0693"/>relaxed and
                            priority given to raising standard of living of Japanese that this will
                            in end result in Japanese Government being able to create sound
                            self-supporting defense force with consequent reduction in need for
                            maintenance large United States forces in Japan. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> will undoubtedly wish to discuss
                            this statement in Washington. He made clear that final phrase of
                            statement to effect that coming visit of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> is “last chance” does not refer to possibility
                            of <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s retirement but to
                            fact that if United States and Japanese Governments cannot now agree on
                            something along lines of statement anti-American feeling in Japan will
                            increase and United States–Japan cooperation will be jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>I expressed appreciation for frank statement of Japanese opinion and said
                            I would be equally frank. I pointed out reasons for previous stress on
                            military build-up as result of Korean war and generally threatening
                            Communist attitude throughout world. While on surface it may now appear
                            that tension has relaxed, I point out there is no indication Communist
                            objectives have changed and, therefore, necessity for free world to be
                            strong remained. I hope that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName>
                            did not mean that Japanese leaders wished to cut back their defense
                            effort as I believed this would not only be dangerous in itself but
                            would create such misunderstanding and antagonism in United States
                            administration and Congressional circles that any aid program for Japan
                            would be prejudiced. I expressed personal opinion that what was
                            necessary was maintenance and some increase in present defense effort
                            but agreed that increased attention should be given to problem of
                            Japan’s economic stability. I expressed opinion that economic and
                            defense programs should advance hand-in-hand, that if we had neglected
                            economic aspect perhaps that should have temporary priority to bring it
                            up to defense level, but that in meantime there should be no slackening
                            in latter. I stressed again vital importance of Japan taking steps on
                            its own if United States aid was to have any meaning. In discussing this
                            statement in Washington, I believe we should make clear that Japan
                            cannot expect lasting higher living standards unless there is
                            improvement in basic economy of country and that this is, in first
                            instance, Japan’s job. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> said
                            he understood my argument and would take it into account in presenting
                            his thoughts to United States officials. He agreed there should be no
                            cut-back in defense program but made no commitment about any
                            increase.</p>
                        <p>I urge that most serious consideration be given <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName>’s statement and that it not be
                            brushed off as simply Japanese attempt to get United States agreement to
                            relaxation of effort. I sense a growing restiveness in government
                            circles here at what they interpret as American pressure, if not
                            dictation, and certainly press has given public idea that United States
                            is using Japan for its own ends without <pb xml:id="pg_1750" n="1750" facs="0694"/>regard to needs or desires of Japan itself. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName>’s statement is expression his idea
                            of how this situation can be met and remedied. To use a favorite
                            Japanese expression, I believe <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> is “sincere” and our reaction should be guided
                            accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said that he had
                            originally thought $1 million would be enough to satisfy the various
                            Japanese claims in connection with the damages suffered by Japan as a
                            result of the explosion of the hydrogen bomb at Bikini. Then Kuboyama
                            died and the Japanese are finding that even at this late date many
                            tunafish have to be thrown out because of radioactivity. These facts
                            have changed <pb xml:id="pg_1751" n="1751" facs="0695"/>the situation.
                            He himself had talked on the telephone to Tokyo the day before and he is
                            now convinced that one million dollars will not achieve the purpose of a
                            settlement which will be generally thought to be satisfactory. He
                            pointed out that the Japanese Government has already put out 430 billion
                            yen in loans to people in the fishing industry who have suffered losses.
                            Some of the people in Japan have proposed a partial settlement now, and
                            then continuing discussion of the total amount. He himself would rather
                            have it all handled at one time. His own personal belief, which had been
                            confirmed with Tokyo, was that it might possibly be done for $1 1/2
                            million but that a figure of $2 million would certainly constitute a
                            satisfactory final settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we
                            understand how difficult this problem is for the Japanese Government and
                            people. We are deeply distressed and concerned that the tests should
                            have produced such unfortunate and unexpected results. He wanted to
                            emphasize that the expenditures of billions of dollars which we are
                            making in our atomic program are not only for ourselves but to serve the
                            dual purpose of protecting the human race from Communist enslavement,
                            and also leading toward the peaceful uses of atomic energy with all
                            their great potentialities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> commented that he had told the Diet the same
                            thing and had been bitterly attacked for it. Nevertheless, he believes
                            that it is true.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of the settlement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said that he had tried to
                            achieve a settlement of one million dollars but this effort had failed.
                            To attempt to do so now would really end the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government even though the situation had changed
                            somewhat after the <hi rend="italic">Toya Maru</hi> accident, which the
                            Japanese Government greatly regretted. With respect to the Bikini
                            incident, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had clearly
                            indicated that the Japanese Government does not want to make use of the
                            case to squeeze money out and in fact he may still be against asking for
                            more than one million dollars. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> believes that this amount would not be enough to
                            create a good public feeling about the settlement in Japan and that such
                            a settlement would be damaging to good United States–Japanese
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we want to
                            do what is fair and equitable but we do not want to set precedents which
                            would be unfortunate. He agreed completely with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> that it would be preferable to
                            have a final settlement. If this proves impossible, perhaps a legal
                            inquiry might be instituted but we hope this can be avoided. If we can
                            agree on a definite figure which the Japanese Government can be sure of
                            we would earnestly consider it. We think that $2 million would be
                            perhaps too high, but that something between $1 and $2 million might be
                            satisfactory. Anything over a million dollars may <pb xml:id="pg_1752" n="1752" facs="0696"/>possibly require Congressional action and the
                            resulting discussions may possibly lead to bad reactions in United
                            States public opinion. However, the important thing now is to see if we
                            can reach agreement on some definite figure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> said that he
                            appreciated having Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s views and that he hoped that we could reach a
                            settlement before the testing program is resumed. He asked whether we
                            had any idea when the tests might be resumed, saying that he needed
                            advance notice in order to prepare people in Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he did not have this
                            information but that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName>
                            could be assured of our full cooperation in this respect.</p>

                                        <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> stated: “This

                                    rehabilitation as an important associate in the free world, but
                                    that higher priority for the first two of these may now be more

                        <p rend="center">Part One: Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The extent of the differences between present US and
                                Japan policies with respect to the national defense of Japan
                                constitutes a major obstacle to the coordination of their political
                                activity</hi>. The defense relationship between the US and Japan has
                            such cardinal importance <pb xml:id="pg_1753" n="1753" facs="0697"/>that
                            into its field of dispute is drawn all other aspects of US-Japanese
                            cooperation—whether concerning the impingement of bases and facilities
                            on the Japanese population, the disposal of US agricultural surpluses,
                            the problem of Japanese internal political stability, or the development
                            of Far Eastern security or economic regionalism. Until the present
                            differences on defense policy can be reconciled, it seems doubtful if
                            there can be that meeting of minds between the two governments required
                            for immediate coordination of political and economic activity in Japan
                            or for the construction of durable bases for US-Japan cooperation.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The failure of successive Japanese administrations,
                                until very recently, even to attack the problems of economic
                                readjustment and internal security has resulted in a stagnant, and
                                in some cases, a deteriorating situation inside Japan since April,
                                1952</hi>. The Japanese approach to these problems is still slow and
                            deficient. The absence of internal security—in government, industry,
                            education, and information—has given to the communists and their
                            apparatus of neutralists, pacifists, innocents, and dupes a remarkable
                            opportunity for agitation, propaganda, and economic disruption. They
                            have used this opportunity fully, and there has been since 1949 a steady
                            seepage in internal political influence away from the conservatives
                            toward an immature and unstable left. These areas are obviously not
                            unrelated to national defense. If Japan cannot be made politically and
                            economically stable, no investment in its defense sector is desirable or
                            justifiable.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The problem concerns, not final objectives, but the
                                adjustment of priorities and time factors</hi>. The most responsible
                            and influential conservative leaders—inside and outside the
                            government—whether pro-<persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> or
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>—have been
                            unanimous in urging the view that the recovery of national strength and
                            the rehabilitation of national spirit depend first of all on a
                            reorganization of the national economy. They have insisted that the
                            strengthening of their economy is the antecedent condition for all their
                            official programs, and they have begun to undertake measures to this
                            end. They have also, as a second priority, begun to prepare themselves
                            to take more effective action against internal subversion. They have
                            accorded a defense build-up and the expansion of their defense
                            industries a lower priority.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">A change of short-run emphasis in our relations with
                                Japan now seems required in order to align our efforts with the
                                realities and the prospects of post-occupation Japan and to conform
                                more closely with the lines along which Japanese conservatives
                                believe they must move</hi>. US policy for Japan as formulated in
                            the crisis of the Korean war, confided too heavily on the recovery of
                            Japanese national spirit, the strength of Japanese political leadership,
                            and <pb xml:id="pg_1754" n="1754" facs="0698"/>the immediacy of Japanese
                            ambition. It assumed that political and economic stabilization could
                            proceed simultaneously with a defense build-up, but that in any event
                            defense should have priority. It has met with only a most limited
                            success. Over the immediate period ahead US policy should place its
                            emphasis on the political objective of assisting the conservatives to
                            consolidate and make effective their majority position in Japan. Unless
                            a strong and stable Japanese Government can be established, the measures
                            necessary to produce greater economic health, to deal effectively with
                            internal security, and to provide for the defense of its people will not
                            be taken.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">This shift of emphasis, over a short run, is
                                moreover indicated by considerations exclusive to US planning: in
                                particular, the need to assess whether—in the light of recent
                                developments—the potential usefulness of Japan may not be less than
                                had been assumed in our mid-1952 policies</hi>. Involved are more
                            precise cost data for the Japanese programs than were hitherto
                            available, the necessity for adjusting strategic concepts to the
                            implications of nuclear technology, and the magnitude of the
                            vulnerabilities of Japan. These are problems which will require not only
                            a reexamination of current <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> doctrines
                            for Japan but the integration of the resulting revisions into the
                            framework of US national policy for Asia and the world conflict. This
                            will necessarily be a protracted effort. Many of the problems inherent
                            in the review will however come to the fore in the negotiation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 55 national defense program
                            which is now at hand. Some interim readjustment of US policy is
                            accordingly indicated.</p>
                        <p>These conclusions derive from the body of this study, its <hi rend="italic">Exposition</hi>, which follows after a summary
                            statement of recommendations. The <hi rend="italic">Exposition:</hi>
                            isolates certain divergences of major significance for US policy between
                            the 1954 and the 1952 assumptions concerning Japan; surveys the credits
                            and deficits in the contemporary balance of the Japan situation and
                            strikes a provisional reckoning of Japanese prospects; presents a
                            detailed statement of the Japanese position on defense policy and of its
                            economic and political rationale with particular reference to the
                            special nature of the US-Japan defense relationship; and poses what
                            appear from the Tokyo point of view to be the essential questions for a
                            longer term re-evaluation of US planning with respect to Japanese
                            rearmament.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Part Two: Recommendations</p>
                        <p>For the period of the next two Japanese Fiscal Years, or until March,
                            1957, the following recommendations are submitted:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1755" n="1755" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The goal of increased political stability in Japan
                                should be given absolute and urgent priority in our programs</hi>.
                            This will involve the orientation of policy to the objective of
                            strengthening the moderate conservative movement in Japan. In the face
                            of the immaturity and susceptibility of the non-communist Japanese left,
                            the US over the next several years can hope to work with no other
                            element in Japanese political life. The leadership of the moderate
                            conservatives is not at present strong enough, or skilled enough in the
                            processes of party and public opinion management to move toward
                            self-support in the Japanese economy, to control effectively internal
                            subversion, or to lay enduring foundations for US-Japan cooperation. US
                            policy should be directed to strengthening both the structure and the
                            appeal of this leadership and should consider the following specific
                            actions:</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">In the field of Japanese defense:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. The US should be prepared to accept with a minimum of
                                bargaining anticipated Japanese proposals for only a slight increase
                                in the <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 55 national defense
                                budget (including reductions in the 1 Japanese share of local
                                support costs for <gloss target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss>). It should
                                recognize on the basis of the 1953 experience that a long and
                                stubborn negotiation would be required to raise their budget
                                proposals further; that in the end we should probably agree to
                                accept very little more; and that whatever additional slight
                                increase was obtained, again on the basis of experience, might not
                                in fact be spent. US policy should instead use the leverage of
                                agreeing to the Japanese defense proposals in return for unequivocal
                                commitments to take specific actions in the fields of economic
                                austerity and internal security.</item>
                            <item>b. The US should compensate for the decreased Japanese
                                contribution to <gloss target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss> costs by
                                announcing in calendar year 1955 that one US Army division or some
                                specific percent of US ground forces would be withdrawn from Japan
                                but maintained in Pacific area. This would additionally: (i) ease
                                the mounting frictions of our continued stationing of US Forces in
                                Japan; (ii) break the link idea by which the Japanese believe that
                                they can control the deployment of our forces by their defense
                                inactivity.</item>
                            <item>c. The US should also begin to prepare, and should announce its
                                intention, to remove progressively from Japan those units of United
                                States Armed Forces and United Nations’ military forces whose
                                presence in Japan has some other primary justification than the
                                defense of Japan. The whole concept of Japan as a staging or a
                                stockpiling area for troops which might, in certain contingencies,
                                be sent elsewhere in the Far East needs review in terms of the
                                probable US response to new acts of communist aggression and in
                                terms of the continuing strain on US-Japan political relations
                                imposed by the prolonged quartering of foreign troops in
                                Japan.</item>
                            <item>d. If these actions are taken, the major deterrent to Soviet or
                                Chinese Communist aggression against Japan must continue to be the
                                knowledge that the US would come to the assistance of Japan in the
                                event of the aggression. This deterrent influence of US power could
                                be reemphasized in this context either by the conversion <pb xml:id="pg_1756" n="1756" facs="0700"/>of the Security Treaty
                                into a mutual defense treaty (as proposed in paragraph 4a below) or
                                by the issuance at an early date of a unilateral public declaration
                                that the US would regard as a threat to its own national security
                                any attempt at military aggression against Japan or any attempt to
                                change by force its form of government. Either would extend to Japan
                                essentially the same form of guarantee that has already been given
                                to the Republics of China, Korea, and the Philippines.</item>

                                programs. If a reasonably adequate program of self-help and
                                austerity is undertaken, the United States should be willing, over
                                the period of the next two years, to extend forms of direct economic
                                aid or guarantees as may be required, including if necessary a
                                currency stabilization credit. This willingness should be
                                communicated privately, at the senior level, to the Japanese
                                Government as a commitment by the US to support a conservative
                                Japanese administration willing to undertake, in the immediate
                                future, difficult policies for political and economic
                                stabilization.</item>

                                and austerity are in general well understood. As formulated in the

                                for the conversion of US-Japan Security Treaty into a reciprocal and
                                mutual defense treaty and for the revision of the Administrative

                            <item>b. A systematic effort should be made to increase the prestige and
                                participation of Japan in Asian affairs. In particular, the US
                                should encourage the attendance by Japan at every multilateral
                                conference on the Far East that the US attends in the company of
                                other Asian states. While emphasizing the independence and
                                sovereignty of Japan, the US should seek to appear to the Japanese
                                public as determined to secure the reintroduction of Japan into the
                                councils of the international community as the Soviet Union appears
                                to them to be in its sponsorship of the introduction of Red
                                China.</item>
                            <item>c. The liquidation of all World War II residues between the US and
                                Japan should be undertaken urgently. In particular an inventory
                                should promptly be taken of all claims and obligations against or in
                                favor of Japan arising from World War II. (For example, we are still
                                negotiating not only <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> but
                                also on claims for the wartime bombing of the Embassy Chancery in
                                Tokyo and the US Consulate at Nagasaki, for the accounts of Trust
                                Territory residents, etc.) All these should be settled urgently and
                                by the end of 1955 at the latest.</item>
                            <item>d. The US should offer to provide, at the request of Japan,
                                technical assistance, including equipment and training, for more
                                effective internal security operations.</item>
                            <item>e. The present unilateral status of the Atomic Bomb Casualty
                                Commission, as a United States investigative laboratory unable to
                                treat Japanese survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, should be
                                converted either to a joint US-Japan institution or to an
                                international institution, open to all nations which care to
                                contribute to its support or to all which have adhered to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Atomic Pool. In either event the
                                Japanese side should include Japanese physicians qualified to treat
                                Japanese patients. Present resentment over the present ABCC status
                                is an important irritant to US-Japan scientific cooperation.</item>
                            <item>f. Consideration should be given to a greatly expanded exchange of
                                persons program and to the establishment, from Japanese postwar
                                financial obligations payable to the US, of a scholarship foundation
                                for Japanese youth. If approved, this would require the recruitment
                                of the highest caliber of US personnel to administer the
                                program.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>5. This program should be presented to the Japanese as a contingent
                            program, all or part of which would be undertaken by the US in return
                            for specific actions by Japan.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. So far as the acceptance by the US of the Japanese <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 55 defense program and the grant of
                                presently contemplated US economic assistance, are concerned, the
                                essential conditions should be:<list>
                                    <item>i) that in the field of economics, Japan adopt and carry
                                        out reasonably satisfactory program of austerity and
                                        self-help;</item>
                                    <item>ii) that Japan institute and apply a systematic program to
                                        deal effectively with the problems of internal security,
                                        with the communist penetration of its trade unions, with its
                                        communist manipulated mass media, and with its leftist
                                        controlled schools; and</item>
                                    <pb xml:id="pg_1758" n="1758" facs="0702"/>
                                    <item>iii) that the implementation of this program should be
                                        reviewed by a continuing joint US-Japan Council, composed of
                                        senior officers of both governments. The Council should be
                                        empowered to require and receive specific progress reports
                                        on activities of mutual concern and to make recommendations
                                        for appropriate action. Whether the Council itself or its
                                        terms of reference should be classified will require
                                        additional consideration.</item>
                                </list>
                            </item>
                            <item>b. The rest of the program suggested above should be equated with
                                specifics of Japanese performance: e.g. willingness to revise the
                                Security Treaty should be conditioned on an agreement for the
                                long-term US occupancy of air and navy bases in Japan, including any
                                special weapons understandings considered indispensable; the loan or
                                the grant of police equipment in return for closer internal security
                                coordination.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>6. These recommendations are only illustrative. They are products, not of
                            new US objectives in Japan, but of altered emphases and priorities in
                            our approach to the Japanese problem. They are designed to determine how
                            much can be accomplished, within a two year period, toward producing the
                            basic requirement for the long-term US-Japan relationship: a strong,
                            stable conservative government in Japan. Whether such a government can
                            be created will determine in large measure the kind of adjustment US
                            policy will be obliged to make to take into account the geographic, the
                            strategic, and the technological vulnerabilities of contemporary Japan.
                            This much is certain: the stakes are too immense to permit longer the
                            stagnation which has taken place in Japan since 1952.<note n="2" xml:id="d818fn2">The “Recommendations” section ends here. The

                                State files.</note> over a month ago. At the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> meeting, and possibly at the 5:00 briefing this
                            afternoon with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>, two
                            matters may come up:</p>
                        <p>1. Bikini compensation. This is not specifically discussed in the
                            Progress Report but it is a subject of interest to the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> raised the matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> last Saturday and said he
                            thought $2 million would be a very satisfactory settlement. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he thought
                            this might be too high but that something between $1 million and $2
                            million might be satisfactory. We have canvassed this problem within the
                            Department in preparation for the <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> visits; it is our feeling at the working level
                            that with Kuboyama’s death $1 million will no longer do the trick and we
                            feel we must reconsider our position. L wishes to avoid a joint legal
                            investigation on the ground that this will be most difficult and might
                            set dangerous precedents and they therefore have recommended we go as
                            high as $2 million to settle on a non-legal basis. I concur in this view
                            and feel we also must consider the adverse reaction in Japan if a joint
                            legal study should drag on for a long time. We are hopeful that we can
                            get up to an additional million dollars from <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> sources if this is necessary but it will require a
                            strong appeal to the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> and the
                            agencies concerned. We told <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> incidentally we might have to go to Congress. If
                            you concur I recommend that you tell the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> you agree that settlement at $2 million is the best way
                            out of this messy problem.</p>
                        <p>2. Psychological strategy plan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> has sent you a letter dated October 22<note n="2" target="d819fn2">Not found in Department of State
                                files.</note> asking your views on how we might expand our efforts
                            in Tokyo to carry out this plan. A copy of this letter is attached.

                                <p>“The Progress Report on Japan was approved after considerable

                        <p rend="center">A. Summary of Major Actions</p>
                        <p>1. The United States has in the past two years concluded a number of
                            important agreements with Japan, including a Mutual Defense Assistance
                            Agreement, Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, and revision
                            of the criminal jurisdiction provisions of the Administrative Agreement.
                            Joint agreement was also reached for return of the Amami Oshima group to
                            Japanese control.</p>
                        <p>2. During 1953 Japan incurred a serious balance of payments deficit
                            notwithstanding a continued high level of United States special
                            expenditures of about $785 million. This imbalance continued during the
                            early part of 1954. Corrective measures initiated by Japan in October
                            1953 alleviated this condition. For the past six months ending September
                            1954 a balance of payments surplus appeared even though U.S. special
                            expenditures declined to an annual rate of about $550 to $600 million.
                            Japan was admitted provisionally to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
                            Trade and the United States is taking the lead in multilateral
                            negotiations to bring Japan fully into <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. United States preparations are underway for
                            comprehensive United States–Japanese tariff negotiations, which are
                            scheduled for early 1955. Private technical assistance arrangements and
                            loans totalling $40 million by the International Bank for Reconstruction
                            and Development have been made, but Japanese productivity is still
                            deficient in important fields. United States economic assistance to
                            Japan consisted of a grant of $10 million in local currencies to Japan
                            under the agricultural surplus program, and three short-term cotton
                            loans totalling $160 million by the Export-Import Bank. Japan’s
                            contribution to U.S. forces was reduced by $7 million. Negotiations for
                            settlement of the claims of the United States arising out of economic
                            assistance rendered during the occupation (<gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss>) were begun.</p>
                        <p>3. Japan has increased the size and strengthened the functions of the
                            Japanese defense forces, although the total is still well short of that
                            considered desirable by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Japanese <pb xml:id="pg_1762" n="1762" facs="0706"/>Diet has authorized an
                            expansion of Japanese defense forces to a total of 164,538 men,
                            including the new air force, and has empowered them to resist direct
                            attack. The United States provided increased military assistance to
                            Japan, and will continue to do so under the Mutual Defense Assistance
                            Agreement through substantial military grant-aid and training programs.
                            Some progress has been made toward the establishment of a Japanese
                            defense production base, largely through the activation by offshore
                            procurement of a broad range of ammunition and explosive manufacturing
                            facilities for small arms and artillery. Plans are being formulated for
                            the establishment of limited capacity for production of certain tactical
                            military aircraft over the next two years. Arrangements have been
                            completed for a joint United States–Japanese industrial mobilization
                            planning group to study the development of a broader production base in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>4. Vigorous information programs have been carried on to give the
                            Japanese a better understanding of the United States and of world
                            problems and to combat leftist and neutralist influences.</p>
                        <p>5. Japan has continued to cooperate with the United States on security
                            export controls. Pursuant to understandings with the United States it
                            has gradually reduced the number of items embargoed to Communist China
                            to those multilaterally agreed.</p>
                        <p rend="center">B. Operational Considerations Bearing on Policy</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/2 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/6 were designed to cover the
                            immediate post-Treaty period, during which the Japanese were regaining
                            their sovereignty. Certain important objectives have not been achieved
                            and it can be anticipated that troublesome problems in relation to Japan
                            will arise and continue. Economic difficulties, ineffectual governmental
                            leadership, pressure from Communist areas, and reluctance in moving
                            positively toward self-defense have not been solved. In addition, there
                            have arisen a serious increase in neutralist sentiment, periodic
                            flare-ups of anti-Americanism and an intensification of communist
                            overtures to Japan. New factors have arisen in U.S. relations to Asia
                            such as the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and the proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> economic grouping. As a
                            consequence, a complete review of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            125/2 and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/6 and of U.S.
                            objectives and courses of action is recommended.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/2, paragraph 7b(2) and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/6, paragraph 3b(1) give emphasis to
                            the development of Japanese ground forces while Defense has stressed the
                            necessity for a force structure composed of appropriate strength in
                            naval and air forces as well as ground. The Japanese on their part
                            appear to question this force concept, laying greater emphasis on air
                            and naval forces. There is also feeling in Japanese military circles
                            that nuclear weapons require revision of <pb xml:id="pg_1763" n="1763" facs="0707"/>present defense plans. Several problems such as joint
                            planning, Japan’s role in the Far East security picture, and ultimate
                            initiation of withdrawal of U.S. forces have become more important now
                            that Japan has taken the initial steps to expand its defense structure.
                            A new <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper should take cognizance
                            of these problems in the light of the current situation.</p>

                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Economic Difficulties</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Japan’s economic difficulties present an obstacle to the attainment by
                            the U.S. of certain major objectives in Japan, particularly in respect
                            to the strengthening of international economic relationships,
                            cooperation with other friendly nations of the Far East, and the
                            indigenous support of an adequate defense program. There exists an
                            uncertainty as to the ability of the Japanese Government to continue and
                            expand measures which recently improved the balance-of-payments position
                            in the face of diminishing U.S. military expenditures. Japan’s financial
                            future is further obscured by the unsettled reparations arrangements
                            with Southeast Asian countries, which are also adversely affecting the
                            development of a healthy trade pattern. Decision has been made to
                            establish an <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> mission in Tokyo. The
                            prospective decrease in U.S. special expenditures will increase the
                            difficulties of Japan attaining self-support by Japan, and the U.S.
                            should, therefore, give particular attention and emphasis to (1)
                            reduction of trade barriers, by negotiating with Japan at the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations scheduled for February
                            1955, and by encouraging friendly third countries to negotiate
                            similarly; (2) exercise of greater control over the programming of U.S.
                            Government expenditures in Japan, so as to anticipate and ameliorate the
                            effect of diminishing dollar receipts from this source; (3) improvement
                            of productivity, through a jointly financed technical assistance
                            program, and the investment of dollars and local currencies; (4)

                                <p>“No economic assistance as such is being given Japan in USFY 1955
                                    and none was provided in USFY 1954. The following steps in the
                                    nature of financial assistance have been taken: (a) It was
                                    agreed to reduce the monetary support by Japan to United States
                                    forces in Japan pursuant to Article 25 of the Administrative

                                    equivalent of $148 million. (b) The United States has undertaken
                                    to furnish military equipment for Japanese forces on a grant or
                                    loan basis, the precise equipment to be determined on the basis
                                    of further consultations, $78 million of USFY 1954 military

                                    are tentatively programmed for USFY 1955. In addition
                                    legislative authority was obtained in the Mutual Security Act of
                                    1954 to transfer equipment for the Japanese ground forces
                                    procured out of previous Defense Department appropriations and

                                    $40 million will be financed by the yen proceeds of the sale of
                                    agricultural commodities to Japan under the provisions of
                                    Section 550 of the Mutual Security Act. (d) An agreement has
                                    been concluded under Section 550 of the Mutual Security Act
                                    whereby Japan will purchase approximately $50 million worth of
                                    agricultural commodities and one-fifth of the local currency
                                    proceeds will be used for assistance to Japanese industry

                        </p>
                        <p>Conservative groups are politically dominant but continue to be split by
                            personal rivalries rather than differences of principle. If these groups
                            could cooperate effectively they would control about two-thirds of each
                            House of the Diet, and would be able to carry out policies on which they
                            generally agree for economic stabilization, control of leftist activity
                            and stronger defense. Particularly needed are government programs to
                            awaken the nation to a sense of international responsibility, to take
                            legal measures against Communists, and to combat the neutralist,
                            anti-American tendencies of many of the individuals in Japan’s educated
                            groups. The U.S. should do what it can to encourage effective
                            conservative action in Japan, although the immediate prospects of
                            conservative merger and effective government leadership are not
                            good.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Measures undertaken by the Japanese Government to expand its self-defense
                            forces including tentative five-year plans, fall far short of the goals
                            set by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. In contrast to the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> force goals of 348,000 for
                            ground forces, the Japanese Government has shown a comparatively greater
                            interest in expanding its air and naval forces. Serious disappointment
                            has been shown by the Japanese Government in the alleged failure of the
                            U.S. to make available the 17 naval vessels requested. However, a
                            general support has been obtained for the government’s defense program
                            and there appears <pb xml:id="pg_1765" n="1765" facs="0709"/>to be a
                            growing popular acceptance of military institutions. In addition to the
                            economic situation, there are political and psychological factors which
                            impede the development of an adequate defense program. A growing
                            tendency is becoming evident on the part of the Japanese Government to
                            make any defense build-up dependent on increased U.S. military and
                            economic assistance and reduction in Japan’s contribution to the
                            maintenance of U.S. security forces in Japan. In view of the present
                            international picture in the Far East the pressures in this direction
                            can be expected to increase rather than to diminish. The U.S. should
                            continue programs of military assistance as well as efforts to reach
                            agreement with Japan on the size and strategic role of its forces.
                            Further progress toward the establishment of a Japanese defense base
                            adequate to meet U.S. objectives will be dependent largely on the
                            furnishing by the U.S. of technical production services, facilities
                            assistance, educational orders, and a continuing offshore procurement
                            program; and the development of all these programs will call for a
                            substantial cooperation by the Japanese themselves. In view of Japan’s
                            reluctance to act positively and the economic situation, with the
                            likelihood of diminishing U.S. military assistance funds—particularly
                            those authorized for offshore procurement—the U.S. must be prepared to
                            take measures to provide specifically for this purpose, or accept a slow
                            rate of development in this field.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The consolidation of Communist power in Mainland China and North Korea
                            and its expansion into Southeast Asia are exerting pressure on Japan to
                            increase economic relations and to consider more seriously establishment
                            of political relations with Communist Asia. Japanese ties, both
                            political and economic, to the United States and the free world will
                            remain proportionately much greater, but under foreseeable circumstances
                            trade with the Asian mainland will exercise a powerful attraction. If
                            the Communists see fit to encourage it, such trade could develop
                            substantial magnitudes even under present international multilateral
                            limitations. While United States influence on Japan and bargaining power
                            would remain considerably greater, the development of Communist trade
                            will probably tend to give the Japanese Government a greater sense of
                            freedom in dealing with the United States. A major purpose of measures
                            discussed under paragraph 8 above is to assist Japan in resisting
                            Communist attractions and align Japan more firmly with the United
                            States. It should be noted that Indochina itself is not of great trade
                            significance for Japan but the problem of Communist attraction and
                            pressure would be greatly increased by Communist expansion into other
                            areas of Southeast Asia.</p>

                            the Pacific area to develop relationships which will contribute to their
                            security, and in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 125/ 6, para 3a(2),

                            which would include Japan. The problem of developing a sense of
                            interdependence in the area, which is clearly the necessary prerequisite
                            to the establishment of a security organization of the nature
                            contemplated, and U.S. actions taken to overcome this difficulty, are
                            discussed on pp. 9–11 of Annex A. In particular a resolution of
                            outstanding issues between Japan and Korea and the settlement of the
                            reparations and other questions between Japan and the Philippines,
                            Indonesia, Burma and the Associated States are prerequisites to the
                            effective development of constructive political relationships, economic
                            cooperation and collective security arrangements in the Far East.</p>

                                    <item>The Japanese Government and people continue to desire the
                                        return of the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands to Japan, although
                                        public pressure for their return has declined somewhat, and
                                        return of Amami Oshima to Japan was an important source of
                                        good-will to the United States. Because of the critical
                                        strategic importance of these islands the United States must
                                        continue to impress upon the Japanese its intention to
                                        retain control over them pending the establishment of
                                        enduring conditions of peace and stability in the Far East.

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">Bob</persName>: I had occasion to see
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> in his office on
                            October 27 and thought I might record briefly several parts of the
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>(1) Referring to the “New Look” papers, General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> said that he did not think that
                            Japan was necessarily indefensible despite the number of fighter and
                            light bomber fields ringing the Japanese islands. He was by no means
                            sure that we could not prevent saturation of the islands by enemy atomic
                            attack. The critical problem for us was the time factor in delivering
                            our weapons over the target. This, of course, is a most sensitive
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>(2) Further on the “New Look” paper, the General said that he did not
                            think that the Command and the Embassy were very far apart. I said that
                            my own feeling was that we were primarily interested in exploring a
                            change of emphasis and timing rather than a change of basic objective,
                            that we now thought we should accord priority to strong government,
                            economic reconstruction and Japanese defense forces in that order.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> said that he was
                            concerned that if he withdrew our forces, Japan would be placed under
                            intolerable pressure from the Soviet Union and forced into a neutralist
                            position. In this connection, he spoke of recent airfield construction
                            in Saghalin and of the quantity of MIGs located on the fields within
                            sight of Hokkaido. He said that whereas we do not use our military might
                            to force political concessions, he was certain that the Russians would
                            endeavor to do so. I said that I thought the biggest deterrent to attack
                            and the biggest encouragement to Japan in standing up to Russian
                            intimidation was the Japanese knowledge of our basic interest in Japan’s
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>(3) Regarding support costs under Article 25, 2 (b),<note n="1" xml:id="d821fn1">Of the Administrative Agreement.</note> General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> said that if the
                            Japanese would really spend the money for developing the military
                            establishment, he was not in the least adverse to reducing support costs
                            very substantially. He said that he thought we would get more for our
                            money here spending it for Japanese soldiers than for American soldiers.
                            He was concerned as to whether they would actually spend the money,
                            however, and in that connection, <pb xml:id="pg_1769" n="1769" facs="0713"/>expresses his endorsement of our note reserving the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> called the Secretary
                            today and said that up to last night no agreement had been reached with

                                <p>In a U.S. position paper on this issue dated Nov. 8, the
                                    Japanese request is summarized as follows:</p>
                                <p>“The Japanese have placed great emphasis over many months upon
                                    participation in the programs for the sale or grant of U.S.
                                    agricultural surplus under Public Law 480. They have requested
                                    sales of commodities aggregating $400 million in value over
                                    three years, including $133 million for the current U.S. fiscal
                                    year, plus a grant of commodities for their school lunch
                                    program. They have submitted details for the use of the local
                                    currencies to be paid by Japan under which all of such
                                    currencies would be devoted to purposes directly assisting the
                                    Japanese economy.” (JAP D–3/4, prepared in the Department of

                            </note> He
                            asked the Secretary if he would agree to pin it down at the Cabinet
                            meeting tomorrow. They both agreed that the matter should be pinned down
                            before <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> arrived here. The
                            Secretary said we were not anxious during <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s visit to pass out so much that he would go
                            back and demand a continuation of office on the basis of what we do. The
                            Secretary mentioned the political split in Japan. The Secretary said we
                            should be courteous but restrained. We could use the above or not as we
                            saw fit, but the Secretary thought it desirable to have our own position
                            clear.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that it might be
                            ironed out this afternoon; if not, he would be prepared to bring it up

                                (CP–3)</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> cited
                            the need for reaching a determination, prior to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>’s visit, in regard to the size
                            of the PL 480 program for Japan and as to whether rice should be
                            included in that program. After noting disagreements, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested as a possible
                            compromise that the program be established at a level of $85 million
                            initially, with the possibility of increasing it at a later date should
                            need develop. This suggestion was not questioned or disputed.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the inclusion of rice, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested that rice be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> included in the initial program, but that a clause be
                            written in to the effect that Japan would make its normal dollar
                            purchases of rice from the United States. This would leave Japan free to
                            make her other normal purchases from the Southeast Asia countries.
                            Should there still be need for rice in Japan after normal purchases, the
                            480 program could be enlarged to include rice.</p>
                        <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> pointed out that the
                            United States is faced with a heavy rice surplus this year, that the
                            Trade Development Act was passed to provide for such situations, that
                            Agriculture was responsible for Section 1 of the Act, and that
                            Congressional leaders were very anxious to have some rice included in
                            the program. He noted that the United States was trying to regain its
                            former share of the Japanese rice market and that having rice in the 480
                            program would be helpful in increasing dollar sales also. He believed
                            this could be done without encroaching on the Southeast Asia share of
                            the Japanese rice market.</p>
                        <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> disagreed on the
                            possibility of any market in Japan this year over and above the normal
                            United States and Southeast Asia sales. He noted the bad effect on
                            Burma, Thailand, Pakistan and Formosa should their Japanese market be
                            decreased.</p>
                        <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> suggested that
                            including rice in the program would merely serve to displace dollar
                            sales, and he believed we would end up merely by having the same surplus
                            of rice but with yen instead of dollars in our pockets. He commented on
                            the difficulty <pb xml:id="pg_1771" n="1771" facs="0715"/>caused by
                            expanded production at the same time as many consumers were cut off from
                            the market. There ensued a discussion of the question of developing
                            trade with Communist China by countries other than the United States, a
                            matter currently under study in the National Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his feeling that a compromise could be worked out
                            for including a small amount of rice in the program along with a
                            provision for negotiation with Japan toward establishing a ratio of
                            dollar and yen purchases. At the conclusion of the meeting, the
                            President spoke briefly to Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> and they subsequently worked out an agreement
                            for reserving $15 million for rice of an $85 million initial program,
                            and having the Secretary of State negotiate agreements with Japan to
                            include fulfillment of trade agreement purchases with Southeast Asia and
                            also normal dollar purchases of rice in the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d823fn2">

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MRJG1">Bob</persName>: <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has just completed its third revision
                            of the Country Statement for Japan. In view of the limited number of
                            copies sent back to Washington, I am attaching one of the Embassy’s two
                            copies for your use.<note n="1" xml:id="d824fn1">Not found
                                attached.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Country Statement contains a considerable amount of useful, factual
                            material. However, the most striking aspect of the <pb xml:id="pg_1772" n="1772" facs="0716"/>Statement from our viewpoint is the conclusion
                            evidently drafted under Jerry Higgins’ personal hand, and the covering
                            memorandum which we would guess was written by General Magruder
                            personally. Jerry’s conclusions represent in a sense the military
                            estimate underlying our “New Look” paper, whereas General Magruder’s
                            memorandum clearly is a defense of our present policies in Japan.</p>
                        <p>General Magruder was probably most aroused by the statement that the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> force goals are both unrealistic
                            and misleading. As I believe I mentioned, before, both the Deputy Chiefs
                            of Staff have informally indicated to me their agreement with the
                            conclusions reached by Jerry. However, for the present they are
                            inhibited from making these views formally known.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, we would be interested in getting Pentagon reaction to the
                            conclusions reached in the Statement, since their reaction would give
                            some indication of Pentagon receptivity to a reappraisal of our defense
                            program in Japan.<note n="2" xml:id="d824fn2">The source text bears a

                            three months’ period ending 30 September 1954, and in supplement
                            thereto, the following comments are submitted for your
                            consideration:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>a. The islands of Japan provide the largest portion of a complex
                                of air and naval bases from which to conduct military operations
                                against Communist power in the Far East. Current U.S. war plans <pb xml:id="pg_1773" n="1773" facs="0717"/>and policies assign to
                                Japan key roles in the outer perimeter defense of the Western
                                Hemisphere, as a bastion of the free world in the Far East and
                                particularly as a source of military supply and equipment for the
                                forces of the free world in case of future world conflict.</item>
                            <item>b. As long as the current U.S. strategic concept prevails, Japan
                                will be defended by either U.S. forces, her own forces or a
                                combination of both. This defense will include atomic retaliation on
                                a massive scale and must be assumed to be adequate to prevent
                                annihilation by atomic attack. Based on the assumption that
                                annihilation of U.S. and Japanese forces and complete destruction of
                                Japanese defense industries through atomic attack is not possible of
                                accomplishment by the Communists, it is mandatory that defense
                                industries be created and maintained in Japan. These industries are
                                required to provide for the maintenance of such defense forces as
                                the Japanese may themselves develop, thereby reducing their
                                dependence upon U.S. aid for the maintenance of these forces. In
                                addition, these defense industries are required to provide the
                                necessary mobilization base for rapid expansion in the event of
                                major world conflict, at which time Japan will be called upon to
                                become the arsenal of the free world in the Far East. For these
                                reasons, the creation of essential defense industries must have a
                                high priority in the allocation of U.S. financial and economic aid
                                to Japan.</item>
                            <item>c. The negotiation of next year’s Japanese defense budget (and
                                Japan’s share of <gloss target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss> local costs)
                                will bring to the fore perhaps the most important decision the U.S.
                                has had to make in Japan since the peace treaty went into effect.
                                The Japanese Government must be persuaded to provide for the maximum
                                self defense by Japan in consonance with her economic capabilities
                                and as rapidly as possible. We must convince Japan that she cannot
                                rely on U.S. economic and military aid indefinitely—that she must
                                not only raise and maintain armed forces but must create at the same
                                time the industrial capacity to support those forces. Japan must be
                                made to understand that we will assist her for a limited time in
                                this effort provided there is assurance on her part that she will
                                maintain the necessary security measures and military posture to
                                protect herself and her industrial plans from internal subversion
                                and Communist attack. Japan must be assured that in the event of
                                major conflict between the forces of Communism and the free world,
                                the free world will assist in the defense of Japan and will rely
                                heavily upon Japan as a source of military supply and
                                equipment.</item>
                            <item>d. Japan’s economic position is the most important and potentially
                                hazardous long range consideration. The dominant factor in that
                                position is her present inability to export in sufficient volume to
                                pay for essential imports. So long as this condition continues (and
                                it can be improved only slowly) she must rely on the U.S.
                                economically as well as militarily. When the condition is corrected
                                she will be able to advance toward her natural position as the
                                industrial heart of Asia. The energies and skills of her people may
                                save Japan if the industrial base can be modernized and improved
                                sufficiently to meet competition in world markets. Such a program
                                requires strong methods in Japan and great assistance from outside
                                Japan. <pb xml:id="pg_1774" n="1774" facs="0718"/>Japan cannot
                                improve her economic position by her own unaided efforts and
                                simultaneously create and support large military forces.</item>
                            <item>e. There appears to be no acceptable alternative available to the
                                U.S. but to press forward with a coordinated and integrated economic
                                and military aid program wherein the military expenditures continue
                                to contribute to the economic build-up of Japan while at the same
                                time affording the maximum amount of discouragement to Communist
                                aggression.</item>

                            assisted by the Military Defense Assistance Program, must be
                            supplemented by the development of defense industries in Japan to
                            support these forces both in peace and in event of hostilities. Maximum
                            strategic and logistic advantages accrue to the United States through
                            offshore procurement in the Far East of long lead time items and combat
                            critical items currently being issued which will be needed to maintain
                            U.S. equipped forces of Far Eastern friendly nations. The production
                            base resulting from offshore procurement in Japan will, in the event of
                            war, permit partial early supply and maintenance of Far Eastern friendly
                            forces from indigenous sources and will reduce dependence on U.S.
                            sources. This is especially important during the early months of
                            hostilities. The development of Japanese defense industry becomes
                            especially important when examined in the light of U.S. industrial
                            mobilization plans. Such plans do not envisage an adequate supply of
                            critical items to our allies from U.S. production during the first year
                            of war. Moreover, transportation is not expected to be available during
                            that period in the volume required to move such items to our Far Eastern
                            allies because of higher priority requirements. In addition to the
                            strategic and logistic advantages, offshore procurement in Japan of
                            equipment for friendly Far Eastern nations provides Japan with dollars
                            which she desperately needs to maintain economic stability. That
                            stability is essential to restrain the growth of Communist elements in
                            Japan. These dollars reduce the need for direct U.S. economic aid to
                            Japan. They make her more able to import needed modern equipment and
                            technical knowledge which contribute to her ability to support herself
                            economically and militarily. Finally, U.S. funds may often be conserved

                        <p>After greeting by the President, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that he had been instructed
                            by the Emperor and Empress to convey to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, and the American people, the
                            great appreciation of their Majesties for the manner in which the
                            Japanese Crown Prince was received on his visit to the United States
                            last year.<note n="1" xml:id="d825fn1">Crown Prince Akihito had visited
                                the United States in September 1953, as part of a world tour.</note>
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> stated that
                            the Crown Prince had also requested him to convey his personal thanks
                            for the kind treatment he had received and to inform the President that
                            the trip throughout the United States had been one of the high spots of
                            his world journey.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed appreciation for this message and said that it
                            was his desire and that of the United States Government that everything
                            possible should be done to better the relationships between Japan and
                            the United States. The President pointed out that in addition to the
                            sentimental reason for strengthening these friendly relations, it was
                            only hard-headed business sense for all of <pb xml:id="pg_1776" n="1776" facs="0720"/>the free nations to work together in the closest
                            harmony in the face of the constant threat of Communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that while he was not at all certain that
                            Soviet Russia desired war at this time, nevertheless this remained a
                            possibility and that if it should come, all of the free nations would be
                            involved at almost the same time. The President said that he believed
                            that the strength of the free world had been so increased that the
                            Soviet Union would no longer find it possible to pick on one country or
                            area at a time but that it would be necessary for it to attack in many
                            places at once and not give large sections of the free world time to
                            rally for counter attacks. While probably the initial effort of the
                            Soviets would be directed against American industrial and airpower,
                            attacks on other areas such as Japan would certainly not be long delayed
                            and that we would all be in it together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> seemed to concur in
                            this view and said that he and his government were much concerned at
                            Communist propaganda efforts directed at Japan. He said the Communist
                            peace offensive was being stepped up in Asia and that evidences of
                            Soviet “double dealing” were increasing. He pointed out that while the
                            Soviets were attempting to convince the Japanese people of the dangers
                            of American imperialism they were at the same time telling the people of
                            Southeast Asia of the dangers of renewed aggression from Japan. In the
                            Prime Minister’s opinion it was most important for the free nations to
                            take the propaganda offensive away from the Communists and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> was particularly impressed with
                            the necessity of the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan
                            cooperating in Asia in countering the Communist machinations. The Prime
                            Minister said that while he had been in London he had discussed this
                            matter with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName> and
                            had been told that while the British agree on the importance of
                            countering Communism in Asia they did not wish to take any action
                            without making certain that it was in accordance with American policy
                            insofar as possible. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that he had suggested to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> that the three countries might
                            well set up some sort of organization in Singapore under the leadership
                            of the able British High Commissioner Malcolm MacDonald.<note n="2" xml:id="d825fn2">Commissioner General for Southeast Asia.</note> Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said his government
                            was prepared to send a high calibre official to Singapore accompanied by
                            a staff with training and experience in China and Russia and with a
                            knowledge of Communist methods. In response to a question from the
                            President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said he had
                            not yet discussed this matter with the Department of State but that he
                            hoped to bring it up at his meeting later in the afternoon with
                            Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_1777" n="1777" facs="0721"/>of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. The President said he was
                            certain that American officials would always be ready to discuss any
                            plan for cooperation against Communism and he expressed in this
                            connection the highest regard for Malcolm MacDonald.</p>
                        <p>(Although Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            has often in the past expressed the hope that the United Kingdom, United
                            States and Japan could cooperate in countering Communist propaganda in
                            Asia, this is the first time he has made any specific suggestion as to
                            how this might be done.)</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his interest and that of the American government
                            in Japan’s economic health and said that it was our desire to do
                            everything possible, in the light of our world-wide commitments, to
                            assist Japan on the road she was now following. The Prime Minister
                            expressed appreciation for the help which had been given by the United
                            States to Japan after the occupation and said that without this help it
                            would have been impossible for his country to have done what little it
                            had in improving the livelihood of its people.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister pointed out that the success of the present Japanese
                            Government austerity program had brought with it certain problems
                            including a large increase in Japanese unemployment as well as an
                            intensification of criticism of the present Government.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the general discussion of the world situation, the
                            President expressed the hope that progress would be made in developing
                            the peaceful uses of atomic energy and expressed regret that the
                            continued lack of Soviet cooperation made it necessary to devote a major
                            share of atomic capabilities to destructive purposes rather than to the
                            advancement of mankind.</p>
                        <p>Luncheon was then announced and the party broke up and the President led
                            the way to the dining room to the tune of popping flashlight bulbs.</p>

                            the Secretary was last in Tokyo<note n="2" xml:id="d826fn2">In May 1954.
                                In a position paper dated Nov. 5, prepared for the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> visit, Lt. Commander Harriet
                                P. Coxen of the Department of Defense stated in part that Japan was
                                currently requesting a $210 million contribution (largely in
                                U.S.-held yen) over a 2–year period for this project and that
                                General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> considered it
                                militarily desirable. “U.S. will give attention to Japanese proposal
                                for assistance in connection with road construction plan under the
                                surplus agricultural program, but considers it of low priority in
                                comparison with other phases of defense and economic development in
                                Japan, such as rearmament, industrial defense base, communication
                                and warning systems, agriculture and power development, development
                                of export industries and other measures of national interest.”
                                (Conference files, lot 60 D 627, CF 397, JAT D–2/5b)</note> and said
                            he wished to stress the importance of this project. The Prime Minister
                            commented that such a construction program would help relieve
                            unemployment caused by Japan’s austerity program and would also repair
                            the damage done by heavy United States military vehicles in Japan. He
                            also commented on the fine highways he had observed in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that a
                            road-building project would be a good thing but that of course he could
                            not go into the question of who would pay for the program. He added that
                            good roads are a benefit for many purposes and not just for military
                            use. The Secretary observed that we all hoped such a road system would
                            not be required for military action in the defense of Japan. An added
                            advantage the Secretary felt is the fact that Japan has all the
                            necessary materials for road construction and would not have to use
                            foreign exchange for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> and Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Aichi</persName> both said that Japan
                            desires to use yen proceeds arising from purchase of United States
                            agriculture commodities for the development of defense industries and
                            asked the Secretary’s assistance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that there are a number of problems
                            connected with the sale of these agricultural commodities and the use of
                            the yen proceeds. He said he understood these problems were being
                            discussed at different levels by representatives of Japan and the United
                            States.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that he
                            had spoken to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> about a counter peace offensive against
                            Communist propaganda in the Far East. He described various evidences of
                            an intensification of Communist propaganda attacks upon Japan and the
                            other free nations of Asia. He said that he would like tentatively to
                            make a suggestion that to counter these Communist propaganda attacks a
                            “high command” be set up at a central office in Singapore under Malcolm
                            MacDonald. To this office the United States, the United Kingdom, the
                            French and the Japanese would send representatives to exchange
                            information and discuss means for countering Communist propaganda. He
                            had discussed this subject with both <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and Mendes-France. He emphasized that he was
                            talking just about a general principle, the details of which could be
                            worked out later.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it was
                            certainly a very interesting suggestion and that he was pleased to see
                            that the Japanese are doing creative thinking about the means of
                            countering Communism in Asia, even though there may be reasons why the
                            present proposal <pb xml:id="pg_1780" n="1780" facs="0724"/>might be
                            difficult. We will certainly consider it very seriously, although the
                            parties to the Manila Pact may think that this kind of thing is
                            something which should be handled within the framework of the Pact.
                            However, we want Japan drawn into collective activities in the area
                            because if Japan and the United States and others of like mind can work
                            together we can learn from each other and make all our efforts much more
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>In response to a comment by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, about the desirability of bringing the French
                            into any effort of this sort, the Secretary commented on the fact that
                            the French are over-extended in the world and having to cut their
                            commitments. This is the fundamental reason for the dangerous situation
                            in Indochina which has allowed the Communists to move in. The problem of
                            adjusting French interests to the new conditions in Indochina will be
                            very delicate and difficult. For our part, we have sent General

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked whether
                            there is anything additional the Japanese can do to counter Communist
                            activity within Japan, saying that he was disturbed by reports of their
                            moving into key positions in labor unions.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that he
                            had recently established a special Cabinet committee to fight Communist
                            propaganda within Japan and that this Committee is already commencing
                            its work.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> reported on
                            the recent reparations agreement with Burma. He added that he had talked
                            privately with Laurel<note n="3" xml:id="d827fn3">Senator Jose Laurel,
                                in the United States for discussions on U.S.-Philippine
                                trade.</note> in New York and he hoped that as a result of this
                            conversation the reparations talks with the Philippines might be opened.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                            been very pleased to see the satisfactory agreements with Burma. He
                            believes that these reparations agreements can be regarded as an
                            investment for future good will and trade relations and that the
                            Japanese can therefore afford to pay something in order to strengthen
                            their ultimate position in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> then
                            commented on the difficulty Japan would experience in meeting these
                            commitments and suggested the possibility that the United States might
                            guarantee the reparations settlements so that in case they proved too
                            great a burden for the Japanese economy the claimants could be paid. He
                            went on to say <pb xml:id="pg_1781" n="1781" facs="0725"/>that on his
                            trip he had found himself everywhere in the position of a bankrupted
                            banker. Everyone he visited had claims against him—the Italians, the
                            French and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom had pressed him hard
                            on an Article 16 settlement.<note n="4" xml:id="d827fn4">The major
                                documents concerning these negotiations are in file 694.001 for

                            Minister’s suggestion would be either in the Japanese interest or in
                            ours. If all those countries with claims against Japan thought that we
                            would guarantee Japanese payment, their claims would skyrocket. It is
                            far better for the Japanese to settle reparations claims and the Article
                            16 problem now while their economic position is not too
                            satisfactory.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Japanese Position in the World.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed his
                            concern that Japan develop the spirit and strength to resume a place as
                            one of the great nations of the world. He is distressed that there still
                            seems a tendency on the part of Japan to coast along rather than a
                            positive effort to develop the desire and ability which Japan must play
                            if the ruptured balance of power in Asia is to be restored. Japan’s new
                            role obviously would not be based on any vision of conquest but on what
                            a great and industrious people can accomplish. He discussed the
                            situation in Europe where the United States is manifesting a willingness
                            to back the strength and determination of others to shape their own
                            destinies. The effort by Germany has produced outstanding results. The
                            United States is always more willing to give help under conditions of
                            this sort. He believed that the United States and Japan could work
                            together much better if Japan captured this vision of greatness and will
                            to achieve. He said that the Japanese have a great store of
                            understanding and knowledge about Asia which it is very difficult for
                            the United States as an outsider to have. For example, there should be
                            extensive talks between us on how best to deal with Communist China and
                            how to reconstruct the balance of power in Asia. The Secretary concluded
                            by saying that it was only because he felt that the Japanese know he has
                            a real regard for the Japanese people that he had been speaking in this
                            way.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that
                            the Japanese have no idea of depending too much on the United States or
                            of misusing United States generosity. However, they do state their
                            actual situation and their difficulties. The Japanese ambition is to
                            rebuild Japan to a secure independence, both economic and political.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the
                            new austerity program is a very good step in that direction and that it
                            had a good reaction in United States public <pb xml:id="pg_1782" n="1782" facs="0726"/>opinion. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that the Japanese want to
                            use reparations to help rebuild Southeast Asia and develop wider markets
                            there for themselves and other nations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied along the lines of his
                            November 9 press conference, emphasizing the lack of absorptive capacity
                            in Southeast Asia as contrasted with Europe at the time of the Marshall
                            Plan and the need for careful prior planning before attempting to put
                            huge sums of money into the area.<note n="5" xml:id="d827fn5">
                                <p>The
                                    following exchange occurred during the press conference:</p>
                                <p>“Q. Mr. Secretary, Premier <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> of Japan yesterday in a speech suggested
                                    a very large scale investment program and development program
                                    for Southeast Asia, saying that it was bound to go Communist if
                                    such a program were not carried out. Would you care to comment
                                    on that, sir?</p>
                                <p>“A. Well, we are of course well aware of the economic and social
                                    problems which exist in Southeast Asia, and we desire, within
                                    limits that are practical and workable, to contribute along with
                                    others to the amelioration of those conditions. There has been a
                                    tendency, not by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> himself but by others, to assimilate the
                                        <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> suggestion to
                                    the Marshall Plan both in terms of character and amount. It is
                                    true that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> did
                                    suggest an amount which is somewhat comparable to the Marshall
                                    Plan figures.</p>
                                <p>“I think, however, it is necessary to bear in mind that the
                                    conditions which exist in Southeast Asia are quite different
                                    from the conditions which existed in Western Europe, where you
                                    had a highly developed industrial society and the task was to
                                    rehabilitate a plant which had been in being, which had been
                                    used and which the people knew how to use, and to recreate it as
                                    against the damage and disruption which had been caused by the
                                    war. In the case of Southeast Asia you’re starting, so to speak,
                                    from scratch, and the nature of the problem is quite different.
                                    And I’m not today convinced that it would be practical to
                                    attempt to spend, on that effort, certainly at the beginning,
                                    any such figures as would compare with the Marshall Plan
                                    figures. But the whole matter is receiving the very earnest
                                    consideration of the Government and I expect to have very full
                                    talks and exchanges of views with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> about it and with the
                                    leaders of other Southeast Asian and Western Pacific countries.
                                    That is one of the big subjects which we are exploring, have
                                    been exploring, and will continue to explore intensively over
                                    the coming months.” (Department of State, “Press Releases”,
                                    1954, No. 634) <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> emphasized that
                            trade with Southeast Asia is probably a better prospect for Japan than
                            trade with the United States. He showed Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> a brightly patterned flannel
                            shirt made in Japan of cheap material exactly copying a better quality
                            cloth made in the United States, and said that an influential Senator
                            had discussed this subject with him. He commented that this is one of
                            the reasons the Japanese have difficulty in expanding their trade.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that he
                            was not asking for a general amnesty for war criminals but that the
                            question was a very disturbing one for the Japanese public and he hoped
                            that the United States could speed up the consideration of the cases on
                            which the Japanese Government had made recommendations. The Secretary
                            commented on President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s interest on this subject and then referred to
                            the recent change in the rules of the Clemency and Parole Board which
                            allows a parole after ten years. He said that we will do our best to
                            speed up the process of examining the individual cases.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked when the
                                <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement could be
                            reached. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            said that his government’s position is to pay this claim and that the
                            question is being discussed in Tokyo. The Secretary said that we
                            appreciate the honorable attitude of his government and that we are not
                            going to attempt to squeeze every penny out that we can get. However, he
                            does believe it is desirable to settle the question soon. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> commented that an
                            agreement is almost reached on the figure and that perhaps people on
                            both sides are going into too much detail. The important thing now is to
                            reach early agreement on the amount of repayment. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that he believes the
                            Japanese will find that the United States is a very reasonable creditor.
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said that
                            he would attempt to speed up the settlement as soon as he returns to
                            Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it is a
                            very bad thing for friendly nations of the area not to be more closely
                            knit among themselves but he was afraid that the problem of
                            Japanese-Korean relations would take time to solve. The United States
                            has made a number of efforts, particularly at the time President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> was here. We still stand
                            ready to help improve Japanese-Korean relations and are willing to
                            provide a mediator or an observer in any resumed mediations if both
                            sides want such a person. At the moment, however, our efforts seem
                            merely to have succeeded in persuading the Koreans that we are
                            pro-Japanese. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> said, “Time will cure this problem. We must
                            wait.”</p>

                        <p>At the Secretary’s dinner for Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> last evening Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> took me aside and said he had
                            noted that the Secretary had not brought up with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> the question of defense goals
                            for the coming year. He assumed that the Secretary preferred to have
                            this matter discussed in detail in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> then went on to say that
                            he wanted me to know that the Prime Minister did not agree with Finance
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Ogasawara</persName> that any
                            increase in the Japanese defense budget for the coming year should be
                            made up in its entirety by a cutback in the Japanese contribution to the
                            American forces in Japan. According to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName>, the Prime Minister supports the
                            view presented here to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and to me in Tokyo by Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Okazaki</persName> which, in brief, is
                            that while it will be necessary for Japan to request a substantial
                            reduction in their contribution to the American forces, nevertheless
                            they should also make an increase in their defense budget on their own.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> said that the
                            Prime Minister was determined that this should be the government’s
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>I expressed pleasure at receiving this information and I pointed out that
                            in my opinion if Japan should adopt Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Ogasawara</persName>’s position it would create a
                            most unfavorable reaction in government and Congressional circles here
                            and might well jeopardize continued American economic and military
                            assistance to Japan.</p>

                            residents of [Bonin] Islands. The Sec. said Defense is rabid on
                            that.</p>
                        <p>2. Immigrants to South America. It is an initial approach to the
                            population problem and would help develop trade in SA.</p>
                        <p>3. Reparations. The Sec. said they want the difference of what they can
                            pay and what they can’t pay. The Sec. said they should negotiate on the
                            basis that we would not pay—then the price would not go skyhigh. The
                            Sec. mentioned our willingness to help.</p>
                        <p>4. Fishing business.</p>
                        <p>5. Counterpeace offensive. D. said that Y. did not have the unanimous
                            support of his group on that. The Sec. did not know that, and said his
                            ideas are a bit fuzzy. The Sec. tried to get him to develop it.
                            Singapore is far from China and the difference in the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policies would make it difficult to find
                            a common ground. The Sec. told him the idea appeals in general.</p>
                        <p>D. said the principal objectives should be to shore him up in his govt.
                            The Sec. said some feel the political animosity is such, it might be
                            better for him to retire. They don’t have anyone who is his equal. The
                            Sec. said he has excluded all the Delegation from meetings except

                            greater if we can go down to $600 million because the Japanese are
                            anxious to demonstrate to the Diet that the claim of $47 million based
                            upon Japanese coal shipped to Korea during the occupation has been
                            deducted from the amount payable to the United States.</p>

                        <p>The Treasury Department does not agree with the proposed instruction, and
                            considers that the Embassy should be told that the lowest figure for
                            which the United States is prepared to settle is approximately $630
                            million. This is the lowest figure which results from computations which
                            are generally accepted as in accord with the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> decision.</p>
                        <p>We think that the United States stands to gain little and to lose much by
                            balking at the difference which is involved here and that our Embassy
                            should now have sufficiently flexible instructions to conclude the
                            negotiation. In view of the prospects for the Japanese economy, we think
                            the Congress would not complain about a settlement which on a percentage
                            basis fell slightly below the German.</p>
                        <p>If we accept an amount less than about $630 million, the matter may have

                        <p>While agreeing with the basic theme set forth in the Embassy’s
                            reappraisal of US policy toward Japan—that the defense question should
                            be deemphasized. I have serious questions with respect to the hypothesis
                            on which this conclusion is based as well as certain courses of action
                            presented as alternatives to our present policy. While the following
                            comments highlight a few broad points of disagreement, this memorandum
                            was intended in no way to depreciate the outstanding paper prepared by
                            the Embassy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Divergence of National Interests as Basic
                            Impediment US-Japan Coordinated Political and Economic Activity</p>
                        <p>The Embassy takes the defense relationship between the US and Japan as
                            the cardinal issue between the United States and Japan impeding
                            coordination of political and economic activity in Japan and the
                            construction of a durable basis for US-Japan cooperation. This
                            hypothesis, on which the Embassy conclusion, recommendations, and
                            exposition is based, is open to serious question. We have recognized for
                            some time that Japan could be expected to follow a more independent
                            policy within the framework of the US-Japan alignment. It would appear
                            that it is this general trend in US-Japan relations rather than the
                            specific issue of defense that is responsible for US-Japan
                            misunderstandings. The question of trade and other relations with
                            Communist China and the implications of such intercourse for future
                            Japanese alignment with the US would have offered an equally vulnerable
                            jumping-off place for a new look at Japan policy. Furthermore, it would
                            appear that the Bikini experiment, subsequent developments and public
                            hysteria have done more to prejudice US-Japanese relations than any
                            negotiation on defense matters. The continuation of the series of tests
                            in the Pacific offers the prospects of other accidents resulting in a
                            series of compensation claims and prejudicing good will between the US
                            and Japan. European reaction to the Bikini tests indicates that Japanese
                            sentiment is neither unique nor isolated. Hanson Baldwin’s article in
                            the November 7 edition of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> on
                            the potential danger of radioactive ash can not be considered hysterical
                            or uninformed.</p>
                        <p>Is it not probable that strong US pressure on any number of issues where
                            US-Japanese interest diverge will affect constructive US-Japan
                            relations?</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Embassy Subjectivity</p>
                        <p>It would appear that the Embassy in Tokyo has fallen victim to the same
                            “provincialism” which is apparently prevalent among large segments of
                            the Japanese People—fear of Japan’s safety in the event of nuclear
                            warfare; attraction to neutralism; and psychological nihilism. It is
                            recognized that the only effective policy is one <pb xml:id="pg_1789" n="1789" facs="0733"/>based on the realities of the situation and
                            courses of action that can become operable. On the other hand, such
                            policy must take into account the many factors affecting US national
                            interests and may, therefore, have to reach beyond a simple adjustment
                            to the psychoses and fears of certain elements of the Japanese
                            population and perhaps the US Embassy.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Embassy has overlooked the basic relationship
                            between Japan’s search for nuclear safety and its desire to pursue more
                            independent avenues of action. The continuance of Japan’s alignment with
                            the US in the past has been in part attributable to the fact that
                            confronted with the danger of hot war, the lack of opportunity to pursue
                            a more independent policy has counterbalanced Japanese phobias with
                            respect to nuclear weapons. Should Japan become convinced—as present
                            Communist strategy intends—that an era of “peaceful coexistence” is
                            possible, the US will be less able to control Japan’s search for
                            independence, particularly in light of its fears of becoming involved in
                            the middle of a nuclear war. Herein lies the crux of US-Japanese
                            difficulties—the necessity of convincing Japan that its future lies with
                            the United States.</p>

                            have reconciled themselves to travelling at Japanese speed with respect
                            to defense measures, to receive a proposed new policy toward Japan
                            revolving so highly around an issue relative to which substantial
                            agreement based on a mutual moderation of views, has been reached
                            between the US and Japanese Governments. It is recognized that the
                            Japanese may not be aware of these developing attitudes in the US and
                            that there may be strong resistance in certain military quarters to any
                            relaxation of US pressure. It is also recognized that future
                            negotiations on this subject will be delicate and that any action will
                            be interpreted as “pressure”, but presently the US appears willing to
                            follow a reasonable approach. nevertheless, it is a good idea to write
                            this new approach in a revised <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                            Equally Explosive</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that initial US post treaty policy toward Japan
                            over-estimated Japan’s desire and capacity to increase its defense <pb xml:id="pg_1790" n="1790" facs="0734"/>forces. As indicated above
                            out of a review of the situation there is developing a moderate and
                            flexible position. The Embassy now proposes a new “cause celebre”—that
                            of internal security measures. Unfortunately, widely shared Japanese
                            opinions and emotional reactions, such as fear of nuclear warfare and
                            tests, a desire to reach a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> with
                            mainland China, and a drive to act independently—are easily tagged as
                            Communist inspired rather than recognized simply as characteristic
                            Japanese attitudes which unfortunately are readily susceptible to
                            Communist exploitation.</p>
                        <p>The theme of Communists in government, labor and education is thus to be
                            exported to Tokyo. The merits of a program of internal security are
                            recognized, but so is the danger of the imposition of such a program
                            from the outside. Again we are forced to the conclusion that the
                            Japanese will move at their own pace. It is noted in this connection
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> Government has
                            moved in the right direction even though slowly. Perhaps a more
                            important concern to moderate conservatism in Japan is to walk a very
                            careful path between the maintenance of civil liberties and democratic
                            prerogatives on one side and the imposition of controls that touch of
                                [<hi rend="italic">on</hi>] totalitarianism on the other. The
                            balance is more delicate in Japan than in the United States. Perhaps the
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> Government has attuned
                            its actions to what is politically feasible.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Embassy speaks of “internal security measures” in rather
                            broad vague terms. Taking into consideration various sections of the
                            present despatches as well as earlier ones it is possible to conclude
                            that the Embassy is driving at such problems as protection of classified
                            material, removal of Communists from Government positions, refusal of
                            the Government to grant Communist dominated trade unions the rights of
                            collective bargaining, prohibition of Communist activities among
                            teachers, and outlawing of the Japanese Communist party. It is
                            questionable to what extent implementation of the foregoing, even if
                            possible, would counteract the present tendency among most Japanese
                            intellectuals and students to think in Marxist terms. It is these
                            students who will become the bureaucrats and teachers of tomorrow.
                            Whatever steps the US decides it is advisable to take on the narrow
                            aspects of this problem must be supplemented by a more subtle approach
                            in terms of undermining the influence of the Marxist interpretation of
                            history which contains not only its own fallacies (for example the
                            Surplus Labor Theory of Value) but also all the pitfalls of 19th century
                            German metaphysics, particularly as set forth in the Hegelian
                            dialectic.</p>

                            Article XXV</p>
                        <p>The Embassy would make US agreement to a reduction in Japan’s
                            contribution to the support of US forces in Japan dependent on Japanese
                            measures in the field of economic austerity and internal security. Such
                            linkage would undoubtedly create another negotiating impasse and
                            prejudice even the minimum expansion indicated by the Japanese
                            Government. The proposed establishment of a joint US-Japan Council which
                            would be empowered to require and receive specific reports and to make
                            recommendations for appropriate action contains <hi rend="italic">shades

                            nature would constitute an effective basis for US-Japanese relations.
                            The Embassy implies that it is within United States capabilities to
                            influence internal political developments in Japan. It is questionable
                            whether US efforts directed toward any of the avenues where US-Japan
                            interests diverge are likely to be more productive than in the field of
                            defense.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Japan’s role in US Strategy in Far East</p>
                        <p>The Embassy questions the strategic importance of Japan to the US and
                            suggests a review of the existing estimate in the light of new weapons
                            developments etc. However, while raising this challenge, the Embassy
                            accepts the present estimate in suggesting that the Security Treaty be
                            converted into a Mutual Defense Treaty on condition that Japan agree to
                            long term US occupancy of air and naval bases and US use of special
                            weapons in Japan. In other words the US would condition its aid to
                            Japanese forces on Japan’s taking certain austerity and internal
                            security measures (the accomplishment of this is seriously questioned)
                            and would withdraw its marginal forces from Japan at the same time
                            committing ourselves even more fully to the defense of Japan through a
                            Mutual Defense Treaty and recognizing Japan’s strategic importance
                            through long term US occupancy of air and navy bases and the use of
                            special weapons. What does the Embassy envisage that Japan will do in
                            terms of its own defense? Should not a US guarantee of this nature
                            require some contribution from Japan, however moderate? In this
                            connection is not a possible solution that of recognizing Japan’s own
                            interest in its new defense forces, rather than trying to impose on
                            Japan arbitrary force goals and US standards and methods. The rapid
                            overturn in ground forces is recognized by the Japanese as an
                            unprofitable investment. Therein lies one motivation in building up
                            their air and naval forces. Moreover, Japan recognizes the overwhelming
                            necessity of air and naval defense and would deemphasize ground forces
                            for the same reason that the Embassy has suggested that the United
                            States retain long term air and naval bases in Japan.</p>

                        <p>However, aside from the minor point of whether or not the Embassy
                            practices what it preaches, the core of the Embassy paper is the
                            question of the importance of Japan to United States security. The
                            answer to this question in the light of the hard realities of the
                            political and economic problems of Japan is prerequisite to determining
                            the price we are willing to pay to achieve existing objectives in terms
                            of military and economic assistance, and security commitments.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VIII. Conservatism-Leftism in Japan</p>
                        <p>The Embassy paints conservatism and leftism in Japan in rather arbitrary
                            tones. The conservatives can be relied upon and should therefore be
                            supported even though they haven’t done very well so far. Whatever is
                            anti-American is leftism. It is interesting to recall in this context
                            two of the few resolutions unanimously approved by the Japanese
                            Diet—trade with mainland China and postponement of further thermonuclear
                            tests. These two issues were raised earlier as indications of Japan’s
                            interest in following a more independent policy. These issues cut across
                            all groups and cannot be simply identified as leftist. The Embassy
                            points out that the information media in Japan is largely in the hands
                            of leftists. Is this based on the assumption that antiYoshida,
                            anti-rearmament and anti-American themes are necessarily leftist? The
                            Embassy has itself highlighted the possibility that a lot of
                            anti-Americanism stems from anti-Yoshidaism.</p>

                        <p>The economic wisdom of pressuring Japan into a program of economic
                            austerity should be explored in the light of the effect of such program
                            on investment, modernization of industry, unemployment, etc.</p>

                        <p>The established position of the United States is that these islands are
                            under Japanese sovereignty. The Japanese Treaty did not involve any
                            renunciation by Japan of sovereignty over these islands. In the Treaty,
                            Japan did renounce any interest in the Kuriles Islands, but the United
                            States view, expressed at the Japanese Peace Conference, is that the
                            Habomai Islands are not part of the Kuriles Islands. This is also the
                            Japanese view.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union, however, is in actual occupation of the Habomai
                            Islands, having moved in pursuant to a decision by General <persName corresp="#p_MDII1">MacArthur</persName>, who drew a line between
                            Hokkaido and the islands to the north and allowed the Russians to move

                                through the United Nations. He thinks the fact that the Soviets have

                            war criminal problem. I agree fully with the recommendation<note n="2" xml:id="d834fn2">The recommendation was conditional, contingent on
                                whether consideration of parole cases became “too onerous” for the
                                President. Marginalia indicate that <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s memorandum was revised on Dec. 13 to

                                Department of State files. The version printed here was apparently

                            set forth in paragraph 14 that the President be relieved of the onerous
                            burden of considering each case personally and that this function be
                            delegated to the Board.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I believe that political considerations are important
                            in this problem and dictate a more rapid liquidation of the problem than
                            recommended by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d834fn3">In his memorandum <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName> implicitly endorsed the position of the
                                Clemency and Parole Board that no general amnesty be granted. “A
                                general amnesty would be subject to interpretation by the Japanese
                                and the world in general as an admission that the trials were
                                political and that no crimes had been committed. A general amnesty
                                would lose for civilization whatever good has come out of the war
                                crimes trials generally in the way of ameliorating the savagery of
                                war, with particular regard to the treatment of helpless prisoners
                                of war.” Instead parole cases should be considered on an individual
                                basis until substantial justice had been done and “only the hard
                                core of bad cases” was left. “When that time has come, before the
                                end of 1957, and all, or practically all, of the remaining war
                                criminals are eligible for parole, it is recommended that
                                consideration be given to a final clearing of Sugamo by a mass
                                parole to all the war criminals convicted by American commissions
                                then remaining in prison.”</note> The continued incarceration of
                            Japanese war criminals is an important source of political and
                            psychological friction between this Government and Japan, and is
                            inconsistent with United States policies to develop a close political
                            and security alignment with Japan. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> in his <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> of November 10 to the Secretary<note n="4" xml:id="d834fn4">Not printed. The section on war criminals reads:
                                “The continued incarceration of war criminals is to the Japanese
                                public a highly emotional issue as well as a social and political
                                problem. To the families and relatives of these prisoners it is a
                                tragic matter. To leave this problem unsolved serves only to
                                perpetuate the bitter memories of war. Speedy action is requested.”

                                of other issues, is dated Nov. 10 but was not delivered to the
                                Department until Nov. 15, enclosed with covering note dated Nov. 12,

                                (033.9411/11–1254)</note> emphasized <pb xml:id="pg_1795" n="1795" facs="0739"/>the latent friction underlying the war criminal problem
                            and requested favorable consideration by the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>This issue constitutes a residue of wartime and Occupation policies which
                            it is necessary to liquidate in order to bring United States policy
                            toward Japan in accord with existing international realities. The
                            Japanese feel that a few persons are suffering for a guilt incurred by
                            the nation as a whole; they are resentful of the fact that Communist
                            atrocities in Korea have gone unpunished. Nor do they understand why the
                            United States and other western nations persist in carrying on the war
                            criminal program when the Chinese and Philippines who suffered most
                            severly at Japanese hands have granted full amnesty to all war criminals
                            sentenced by their courts. The Japanese believe that since their nation
                            has been readmitted to international society and is being asked to
                            assume international obligations, particularly in the field of defense,
                            this problem should be relegated to the past as rapidly as possible. As
                            Japan becomes more identified with the free world and this inherent
                            incompatibility in United States policy becomes more evident, the United
                            States will be subject to increasing pressure from the Japanese
                            Government and people. Accordingly, the United States will find it
                            increasingly difficult to implement other policies toward Japan in view
                            of the highly emotional attitude which the Japanese people hold toward
                            the question of war criminals. Moreover, a former Japanese Class “A” war
                            criminal, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Mamoru Shigemitsu</persName>, who
                            was paroled by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, may shortly become
                            Japan’s next Foreign Minister.<note n="5" xml:id="d834fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> became Foreign Minister
                                on Dec. 10.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I therefore suggest that consideration be given to a final clearing of
                            Sugamo by a mass parole or by expedited periodic paroles at an earlier
                            date than that recommended in paragraph 13 by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCE1">Snow</persName>. The Board is expected to have
                            reviewed all cases by the end of 1955. In view of the political
                            considerations mentioned above, the early part of 1956 would thus appear
                            the appropriate time to order a mass parole.</p>

                            first discussed the political situation in Japan occasioned by the fall
                            of Premier <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> and his
                            replacement by <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama. Hatoyama</persName>
                            had solicited Socialist support and had secured it by a commitment to
                            hold general elections in Japan in March 1955. This, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, was a matter of anxiety for the
                            United States because in such elections a sufficient number of Socialist
                            members might be returned to the Diet to make it difficult or impossible
                            for the <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> government to
                            secure the two-thirds majority necessary to amend the constitution in
                            order to permit the rearmament of Japan. While pro-American, <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> was known to favor increased
                            trade between Japan and Communist China, on the one hand, and between
                            Japan and the Soviet Union on the other.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> whether he had in his agency personnel who were
                            competent to give him an answer to <pb xml:id="pg_1797" n="1797" facs="0741"/>this question: What would be the net effect on China of
                            encouraging Japan to export a variety of consumer goods for use in North
                            China and Manchuria? The intelligence analysis which the President
                            desired was of very great importance. Might not such trade result in an
                            infiltration of democratic ideas into Manchuria and North China? While
                            the President said he was ready to admit that, given the current
                            political temper here in the United States, the U.S. itself must keep up
                            its embargo on trade with Communist China, did this, however, also apply
                            to Japan? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                            Premier <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had himself
                            proposed a study similar to the one suggested by the President, but that
                            apparently nothing had really come of it.</p>
                        <p>The President again urged Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> to undertake the study, even though there were
                            risks in any policy of encouraging Japanese trade with Communist China.
                            On the other hand, it would be advantageous if we could make the
                            American people realize the vital necessity for Japan to resume its
                            traditional trade with China. Trade, repeated the President, is after
                            all the greatest weapon in the hands of the diplomat, and he would like
                            to have our own State Department make use of such weapons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that he could prepare an
                            estimate such as the President desired on the probable results of the
                            resumption of the trade in question.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> counseled the
                            desirability of reaching agreement on United States trade policy
                            vis-à-vis Communist China prior to March, if that was the date for the
                            holding of general elections in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that there
                            was no doubt that the fall of the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government would bring the question of Japanese
                            trade with the Communist bloc to the fore. Actually it was more a
                            political than an economic issue in Japan. The Japanese were not really
                            likely to get very much by way of an increase in trade with Communist
                            China, even if the current controls were reduced or eliminated. On the
                            other hand, they resented the fact that these controls were the result
                            of American pressure.<note n="3" xml:id="d835fn3">For the section of the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council on
                            the subject report, noted that it recommended a revision of existing
                            policy toward Japan, and promised that the Planning Board would have a
                            new policy statement on Japan for consideration by the Council some time
                            in January.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                            one point on which he wished to make an observation—namely, the
                            percentage of Japan’s total budget which was allocated for military
                            purposes. He did not think it fair to compare Japan and the United
                            States percentage-wise in the matter of the size of their military
                            establishments. Japan was a desperately poor country and it should not
                            be pressed too hard to reestablish a large military force until its
                            economy had grown more healthy. Let us try, therefore, to get the
                            Japanese economy on a sounder base first.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that there
                            had been no real intention to make the comparison to which Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had objected. He added
                            that the Japanese had made notable progress during the last twelve to
                            fourteen months in rehabilitating their financial health. Their economy
                            on the whole, however, was still in a precarious state.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that it
                            would not come as cheering news to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that the new Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName>, was supposed to be an
                            inflationist.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1799" n="1799" facs="0743"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that the
                            basic necessities for reestablishing Japanese economic health were (1)
                            provision of sources of raw materials and markets for Japan in Southeast
                            Asia, and (2) some increase in trade between Japan and Communist China.
                            The President commented with a smile that this was what the warlords of
                            the thirties had said.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he
                            understood that a sharp reduction was being proposed in military end
                            items to be sent to Japan. He questioned the wisdom of so sharp a
                            reduction. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>
                            indicated that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s
                            information was somewhat out of date. The Progress Report covered the
                            period up through September 15, 1954. Since that date—indeed, last
                            week—$120 million had been allocated for offshore production in
                            Japan.</p>

                        <p>1. This memorandum is in reply to your memorandum dated 23 September

                            above, which requested comments and recommendations of the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff on a proposed State–Defense message, and also requested that
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff develop criteria upon which to base further
                            reduction in the Japanese contribution under Article XXV of the

                        <p>2. With regard to Part III B of the proposed State–Defense message, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff still consider that Naval and Air Forces should be
                            expanded as outlined to you in their memorandum dated 21 December 1953,
                            Subject: “Japanese Defense Forces.”</p>
                        <p>3. With regard to your request for criteria upon which to base reductions

                            Agreement with Japan, the Joint Chiefs of Staff note that there has
                            already been a substantial reduction (the equivalent of $7,000,000 in
                            Japanese currency) in the Japanese contribution. This reduction was made
                            with the specific understanding that Japanese force goals and budgetary
                            support remain as previously agreed. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider
                            that the criteria upon which to base any further reduction in the
                            contribution are:</p>

                            Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that mid-November would be a more logical
                            date to conclude both economic and military discussions in Tokyo.</p>

                            that, from the military point of view, the long-range strategic role
                            conceived for Japan is basically sound. The U.S. security interests in
                            the Pacific area are of such importance that we would fight to prevent
                            the enemy gaining any control of Japanese territory. Current national
                            policy is to assist Japan to rapidly develop (1) the means for its own
                            defense, thereby relieving U.S. forces of the sole responsibility for
                            Japan’s security, and thereafter (2) the capability to contribute to the
                            defense of other free nations of the Pacific area. As <pb xml:id="pg_1802" n="1802" facs="0746"/>long as <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>’s overriding mission continues to
                            be the defense of Japan and the Ryukyus, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are
                            of the opinion that some U.S. forces will have to remain in and around
                            Japan until Japanese defense forces have been built up to the scale
                            recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their memorandum to you of
                            21 December 1953, Subject:</p>
                        <p>“Japanese Defense Forces,” or such other scale of Japanese forces as may
                            be subsequently determined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their
                            continuing review of this matter.</p>
                        <p>7. The threat to Japan from Chinese Communist and Soviet Air Forces is
                            admittedly great. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider, however, that such
                            a threat does not require revision of the long-range strategic role
                            conceived for Japan. Any tendency toward reducing defense forces in
                            order to foster the economic development of Japan would seriously
                            endanger the U.S. military position in the Pacific vis-à-vis Soviet and
                            Chinese Communist forces.</p>

                            Staff stated in part:</p>
                        <p>“It is obvious that for the foreseeable future United States power will
                            be an essential element in developing and maintaining a position of
                            military strength in the Far East. It is equally obvious that, under
                            present circumstances, inordinate reliance is placed upon United States
                            power to achieve that end, and too little upon the development of the
                            collective military capabilities of the Asiatic non-Communist countries
                            in that area.”</p>
                        <p>In this same memorandum they further stated:</p>
                        <p>“Basic to the establishment of a non-Communist position of strength in
                            the Far East is the rehabilitation of the Japanese military forces—not
                            along the lines of the ultra-national military attitude of pre-World War
                            II, but along moderate and controlled lines that will enable Japan to
                            exert a stabilizing influence in the Far East. . . .<note n="6" xml:id="d836fn6">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> It is
                            recognized that a military revival in Japan would be attended by certain
                            risks, although there are counteracting factors which would materially
                            limit those risks. In addition to restrictions which would be imposed
                            upon Japan by economic and political factors, it is believed that so
                            long as the United States furnishes the principal offensive air and
                            naval elements of the combined military forces in the Far East, adequate
                            safeguards against the recrudescence of Japanese military power as an
                            aggressive force would be provided.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1803" n="1803" facs="0747"/>
                        <p>“If Japan is ultimately to assume responsibility for her national defense
                            and to join in a concerted effort to resist Communist aggression, the
                            United States must accept the risks, while exerting its efforts to
                            influence the course of Japanese policy to conform to our security
                            interests. Even though, at this time, Japan would not be wholly
                            acceptable as a member of a Pacific regional pact, it is considered to
                            be in United States security interests to foster and support the healthy
                            development of the Japanese military structure to the end that Japan
                            will become capable of providing for her own security and of becoming a
                            contributor to collective security in the Western Pacific.</p>
                        <p>“Time will be an essential element in the dissolution of the obstacles to
                            the formation of the comprehensive system of regional security in the
                            Far East area, but this should not deter the United States from
                            proceeding toward this as an objective.”</p>
                        <p>9. From the foregoing considerations the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded
                            that the United States should seek to reduce the friction and to resolve
                            the differences which now constitute a major obstacle to a collective
                            security arrangement in the Far East; more specifically, seek to promote
                            the acceptance of a rearmed Japan as an important element in the common
                            defense of the area.</p>
                        <p>10. It is recommended that with respect to any review of the long-range
                            strategic role of Japan the foregoing views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            be taken into consideration. It is further recommended that the
                            foregoing considerations be reflected in any additional State–Defense
                            guidance furnished the Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> regarding the long-range strategic role of

                            called on me this morning at his request and said he had been entrusted
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> with a
                                message.<note n="1" xml:id="d837fn1">The <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> cabinet resigned on Dec. 9, and a government
                                headed by <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> took office
                                the following day.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> wanted me to know, and to pass on to Department,
                            that he had made every possible effort upon his return to ensure a
                            peaceful transition to <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName> which
                            would make it possible to carry out commitments he had made abroad.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had agreed to resign
                            and pass on premiership to <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName>
                            and there had been agreement among liberal party leaders that if this
                            could not be accomplished Diet would be dissolved. At last minute
                                <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName> had changed his mind and
                            in view of his refusal to acquiesce in dissolution <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had no choice but to have
                            cabinet resign en bloc. This had result <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> feared of placing <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> in power. It was obvious that <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName>’s action had created deep breach
                            between him and <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> faction of liberal party and that
                            there is considerable bitterness. This became quite clear when in
                            response to question <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said
                            that while he had been willing to remain as Secretary General of liberal
                            party if there had been peaceful transmission [<hi rend="italic">transition</hi>] of leadership to <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName> that under present circumstances he could only
                            “follow his old leader” and remain out of active office in liberal
                            party. Without explicitly saying so <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> definitely implied that <persName corresp="#p_OT1">Ogata</persName>’s action was considered treacherous <pb xml:id="pg_1805" n="1805" facs="0749"/>by <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>. Whether or not <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> will run for re-election if Diet is dissolved in
                            January still uncertain according to <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had
                            intended to resign shortly after designation of new Prime Minister but
                            now it is not certain he will do so although <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> said it was most important that no public
                            indication be given that <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>
                            is considering running again.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> stated Diet would definitely
                            be dissolved in January and that as result of forthcoming elections
                            Socialists would gain approximately thirty seats. He envisions new Diet
                            being composed of about 160 Socialists of both wings and approximately
                            equal division between liberals and democrats of remaining 300 seats,
                            with perhaps a few scattered Communist seats. It is <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s hope that present bitterness
                            among various conservative factions will die down with time and the
                            nearly equal division of conservative strength after the election will
                            make possible some sort of merger or coalition between liberals and
                            democrats. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>’s opinion
                                <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> Government will not
                            make great changes in present Japanese policy and in view of Ichimada’s
                            selection as Finance Minister this is particularly true in economic
                            field. He also anticipated that while new government will, for political
                            purposes, talk a great deal about regularizing relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China and increasing
                            trade with Communist bloc that in fact little will be done.<note n="2" xml:id="d837fn2">

                                    recognized this danger and would bring matter up at next cabinet

                        <p>Part I. Estimated Japanese plans.</p>
                        <p>1. Tentative Japanese Government budget plans for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1955 have been to keep within 1 trillion yen ceiling
                            for total budget, with priority to unemployment and disaster relief
                            measures, maintenance defense expenditures at <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1954 level of 137.3 billion yen. Defense agency has
                            requested 95.2 billion yen, including 67.4 billion yen for maintenance
                            present forces and 27.8 for increased forces. Request for 15–17 billion
                            yen reduction support costs likely in order keep within 137.3 billion
                            budget ceiling.</p>
                        <p>2. More than last year, defense budget decisions will probably be made on
                            political grounds with little regard for Japan’s defense requirements.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HI1">Hatoyama</persName> or successor
                            government will be under strong political pressures to provide in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1955 budget relief to distressed areas
                            hurt by austerity program. Government would require broad conservative
                            backing to push through defense increases rather than larger
                            appropriations for economic relief. In view current political situation,
                            government with requisite positive support for defense not likely to
                            emerge prior to Diet consideration of <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1955 budget next year.</p>

                        <p>1. Although the Japanese had developed a substantial trade with mainland
                            China during the 1920’s and early 30’s, it was only after the political
                            seizure of Manchuria in 1937 that mainland China became a major Japanese
                            trading area—in 1939 it became Japan’s most important trading area. (See
                            Table 1.) Manchuria and subsequently much of China became protected
                            Japanese markets. By developing <pb xml:id="pg_1809" n="1809" facs="0753"/>Chinese and particularly Manchurian economic resources
                            the Japanese provided themselves with an outlet for capital goods
                            exports, and, through increased indigenous purchasing power, a market
                            for consumer goods. In addition they obtained a secure source for many
                            of Japan’s essential raw material requirements, particularly coal, pig
                            iron, iron ore, tin, salt, and soya beans and oil cake. (See Table
                            2.)</p>
                        <p>[Here follow tables 1 and 2, neither printed.]</p>
                        <p>2. Until the war years 1941–45, when Japan was largely cut off from other
                            sources of supply, mainland China was more important to Japan as a
                            market than as a source of imports. Japanese exports to mainland China
                            of textiles, steel, and capital equipment were only partially paid for
                            by purchases of essential raw material and foodstuffs. This export
                            surplus was balanced primarily by Japanese investment in Manchuria and
                            in other areas of China.</p>
                        <p>3. Japanese postwar trade with mainland China has been relatively
                            insignificant. (See Table 3.) Although it had revived somewhat by 1950,
                            Sino-Japanese trade was almost completely stopped by the restrictions
                            following the outbreak of the Korean war. Following the armistice in
                            1953 it began to revive as controls were slightly relaxed. Unlike the
                            prewar period, recent Japanese trade with mainland China has shown an
                            import surplus.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows table 3, not printed.]</p>
                        <p>4. The future level of Sino-Japanese trade will be determined primarily
                            by political factors, and secondarily by economic factors. The principal
                            political factors will be: (a) the extent to which Communist China, in
                            conjunction with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, continues to
                            pursue a policy of Bloc autarky, deliberately minimizing trade with
                            non-Communist area; (b) the extent to which the Free world will maintain
                            controls on trade with Communist China; and (c) the extent to which
                            trade will be used by the Bloc as a weapon of economic and political
                            warfare. The principal economic factors are: (a) the availabilities of
                            Communist Chinese exports of coal, iron ore, salt, soy beans, and to a
                            lesser extent rice and other grains, and (b) the availabilities of
                            Japanese exports of capital equipment which both meet Chinese
                            specifications and are competitive with Free world and Bloc prices.</p>
                        <p>5. In attempting to determine the possible magnitude of Sino-Japanese
                            trade expansion within existing controls, the Japanese, assuming
                            Communist Chinese agreement, estimate that this trade could probably be
                            raised to some $70 million each way per year by 1957. The Japanese
                            Ministry of International Trade and industry has estimated that Japan,
                            at this level of trade, might import from Communist China the following
                            quantities of certain essential commodities:</p>

                        <p>6. We believe that, under the assumptions stated in the preceding
                            paragraph, Sino-Japanese trade could probably be increased to
                            approximately $70 million each way per year by 1957, but that the
                            quantities of rice and soy bean imports projected by the Japanese
                            Ministry might not actually be available. Chinese export of such
                            quantities of those commodities to Japan might conflict with increasing
                            domestic requirements and with export commitments to the Soviet Bloc. In
                            any case, Japanese imports from Communist China at this projected level
                            of trade, although almost two and a half times the value of 1953 imports
                            from mainland China, would still be only 3.5 percent of the projected
                            total of Japanese imports in 1957.</p>
                        <p>7. If controls on Chinese Communist trade were lowered to the level now
                            applied against other Bloc countries and if Communist China desired
                            substantially to increase trade with Japan, we believe that by 1957
                            Sino-Japanese trade could probably be raised to at least $100 million
                            each way. It might even reach $150 million each way, but we believe this
                            would require some diversion of Communist Chinese trade from other
                            export markets.</p>
                        <p>8. The estimate that the $100 million level could be reached is based
                            primarily upon the Communist Chinese capability to export coal and iron
                            ore in greatly increased quantities—a capability which we believe they
                            can exercise without significantly modifying their present trade
                            commitments to the Bloc. It is probable that the large iron ore deposits
                            on the island of Hainan could be exploited without great expenditure on
                            the part of the Chinese. We believe that the iron ore presently produced
                            from Hainan is not included in Communist China’s internal steel program,
                            but is earmarked for export. In these circumstances, we believe that
                            Communist China could probably increase its production on Hainan
                            sufficiently to provide for the export of about 1.5 million tons of iron
                            ore to Japan, a quantity equal to about one third of Japan’s 1953 total
                            iron ore imports of 4.3 million tons. We believed that Communist China
                            could supply a major portion of the coal imported by Japan (some 3.5
                            million tons in 1953) with relatively small investment. It is estimated
                            that Chinese coal production will be approximately <pb xml:id="pg_1811" n="1811" facs="0755"/>100 million tons by 1957, a quantity which
                            appears to be greater than that required for internal consumption and

                        <p>9. Even if Sino-Japanese trade under <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> levels of controls were to reach $150 million by 1957
                            it would still constitute only about 7 percent of Japan’s estimated
                            total foreign trade for that year. Indeed, even if all controls on trade
                            with Communist China were eliminated, we believe it very unlikely that
                            trade relations between mainland China and Japan would regain their
                            pre-war significance. There has been a fundamental change in the Chinese
                            economic situation since the establishment of the Communist regime. It
                            now produces practically all of its own textiles and much of its steel.
                            It is now firmly committed to a program of industrialization and of
                            integrating its economy with that of the Bloc. China’s export
                            commodities are now committed to the needs of its own industries and to
                            those of its Bloc partners. As for Japan, it no longer possesses the
                            political control over Manchuria which permitted it to develop that area
                            as an integral part of its own economy. For these reasons we believe
                            that as long as Communist China remains in the Bloc it is unlikely that
                            Japanese trade with Communist China will become a substantial proportion
                            of Japan’s total trade.</p>

                            Government may create unfortunate impression here that we are continuing

                        <pb xml:id="pg_1812" n="1812" facs="0756"/>
                        <p>As both State and Defense Departments are aware, we have recently
                            presented to Japanese Foreign Office strongly worded note expressing our
                            concern at unilateral reduction by Japanese of 4.5 billion yen in 1954
                            defense appropriation. While situation is not completely analogous
                            nevertheless Japanese can point to fact we have security treaty with
                            them and while there is no obligation on our part under treaty to
                            maintain any specific number of troops in Japan, there does seem to me
                            to be moral obligation at least to give advance notice before public
                            announcements of this sort are made. Embassy and <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> have made considerable effort to get Japanese to
                            discuss their defense problems with us and to engage in joint planning.
                            I do not see how we can continue to expect Japanese to work closely with
                            us if we take sudden action such as this which has appearance of serving
                            only our own ends. Such action also opens both Embassy and <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> who have been continuously discussing
                            these matters with Japanese authorities to charge of bad faith in that
                            they will assume we ourselves had advance knowledge of this action. This
                            is particularly true in view of fact that when original decision for
                            redeployment of US forces in Far East was made last December, Japanese
                            were notified in advance and were told at that time this redeployment
                            would not affect troops in Japan.</p>
                        <p>I strongly urge that any future plans for alteration in our military
                            strength in Japan be communicated to Japanese in advance of public
                            announcement.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Defense Agency has tentatively programmed for the fiscal
                            year beginning April 1, 1956 an increase in ground forces of 20,000,
                            navy–4,000 and air–6,000 and has requested a budget appropriation of
                            95.2 billion yen, including 67.4 billion yen for maintenance of present
                            forces and 27.8 billion yen for increased forces. Last year’s budget
                            provided 78.8 billion yen for the defense forces plus 58.5 billion yen
                            for the support of United States security forces under Article XXV of
                            the Administrative Agreement—a total of 137.3 billion yen. The Defense
                            Agency budget was later cut back to 74.3 billion yen. In view of
                            tentative Japanese Government plans to keep the total <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1955 budget below a one trillion yen
                            ceiling, with priority to unemployment and disaster relief measures, the
                            Japanese Government will undoubtedly take the position that defense
                            expenditures must be kept at the <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>
                            1954 level of 137.3 billion yen. It can therefore be expected that the
                            Japanese will argue that increase in defense forces will be dependent on
                            United States willingness to reduce Japan’s contribution under Article
                            XXV by approximately 16 billion yen (about $44 million).</p>

                            dated December 10, 1954, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> took
                            the position that if Japan was willing to increase its total defense
                            budget for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 55 above as a base figure
                            of 85 billion yen, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would agree
                            to a reduction of the United States share of the defense budget
                            equivalent to one-half of the amount of that appropriated above the base
                            figure.</p>
                        <p>In view of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> determination, Defense
                            takes the position that the negotiations should be initiated on the
                            basis of the 90 billion yen base figure and that no retreat position
                            should be authorized below the base figure of 85 billion yen.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> Position</p>
                        <p>We think that the 90 billion figure as an initial negotiating position is
                            totally unrealistic, and have little or no expectation that the 78.8 or
                            73.8 yen figure will prove acceptable to the Japanese Government.
                            However, it appears impossible to prove this either to the Far Eastern
                            Command or to the Department of Defense without going through the
                            process of an agonizing and unsuccessful negotiation with the
                            Japanese.</p>
                        <p>In view of the present inflexibility of the Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> position, <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> sees no advantage in prolonging the discussion in
                            Washington. If we are right about the Japanese position, the
                            Embassy-Command discussions with the Japanese will make evident the
                            unreality of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> position. A strong
                            recommendation from the Command in Tokyo will have more effect on the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> than any time consuming
                            discussions in Washington. In any event it is unlikely in view of the
                            present political situation in Japan that any final agreement will be
                            reached with the Japanese Government until the new Diet convenes after
                            the elections which are expected to be held in early March. Consequently
                                <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> recommends that we accept the
                            Defense position and authorize the Embassy and Command to initiate the
                            discussions on the basis of the 90 billion yen base figure dropping down
                            to the 85 billion yen base figure if the initial position is
                            unacceptable to the Japanese.</p>

                        <p>At its meeting on November 3, the Operations Coordinating Board agreed
                            that necessary funds of up to $2 million should be made available for
                            settlement of Japan’s claims for damages resulting from the radioactive
                            fall-out from the thermonuclear tests at Bikini.<note n="1" xml:id="d844fn1">A brief summary of this discussion is in Radius’

                            These funds were to be made available under Section 121 of the Mutual
                            Security Act, and the matter was to be cleared informally with the
                            President, although a formal request for a Presidential determination
                            under Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act would not be submitted
                            until the minimum acceptable reparations figure was ascertained.</p>
                        <p>An earlier meeting had authorized Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> to negotiate up to $2 million, but with the
                            reservation that any figure over $1 1/2 million should be reported to
                            the Operations Coordinating Board for approval.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> has just
                            reported that the new Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>, has received general Cabinet
                            approval for a settlement at $2 million. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> recommends that agreement be
                            reached on this sum immediately so that an announcement can be made at
                            New Year’s, which is a traditional time in Japan for settling
                            accounts.</p>
                        <p>It is desirable that this question be settled. The new Japanese
                            Government is a minority government which has promised to hold elections
                            in March. It is therefore unlikely that it will settle this question on
                            any terms except those which it believes to be politically favorable. In
                            consequence, the Embassy believes—and I concur—that it is unlikely under
                            the present circumstances that a better figure than $2 million can be
                            negotiated. Before Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> told the Japanese that he was authorized to
                            settle at $2 million, he would of course make absolutely certain that
                            the Japanese Government was fully prepared to settle at that amount
                            without any further bargaining.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> came in at Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>’s request to receive
                            the Department’s comments on the suggestion made by Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> to the Secretary that
                            a “High Command” for psychological warfare be set up in Singapore under
                            Malcolm MacDonald, with participation by the United States, the British,
                            French and Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> said that we had given
                            very careful consideration to the suggestion and greatly appreciated it
                            as an indication of the Japanese interest in getting together with us to
                            work out ways and means to counter the Communist threat in Asia.
                            Certainly the basic objective of the idea is good, but there is more
                            difficulty when it comes to trying to decide the best method of
                            achieving the objective.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_1817" n="1817" facs="0761"/>
                        <p>One major problem is that the Manila Pact blankets the same area and also
                            provides for consideration of the problem of internal subversion.
                            Consequently we are afraid that the Prime Minister’s specific
                            proposition would not work because it would cut across the aims and
                            objectives of the Manila Pact. (At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> interjected that the February 23
                            date for the Manila Pact meeting in Bangkok is firm and that it will be
                            formally announced on January 3.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> continued that we
                            wonder whether the objective envisioned by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> might not be achieved by giving
                            impetus to our proposal to the Japanese Government of a high-level
                            bilateral consultative body in Tokyo to include the Embassy and the
                            Command on the United States side and appropriate Japanese officials at
                            the Vice Minister or Minister level. Through this means we could assist
                            and amplify each other’s efforts to meet the Communist psychological
                            offensive. However, we do not know what the reaction of the new Japanese
                            Government is to this proposal of ours which is still outstanding.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> said that he
                            believes this to be a very constructive suggestion. He commented that
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had made
                            the same suggestion to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            as he had made to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. About mid-December the Japanese had received a
                            somewhat similar suggestion from the United Kingdom except that the
                            United Kingdom had envisioned a trilateral or quadrilateral consultative
                            body in Tokyo. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName>
                            himself believed that such an arrangement would be most helpful both for
                            exchange of information and for developing coordinated plans of
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> concluded by saying
                            that he thought it might be left to the Japanese Foreign Office to take
                            the initiative in Tokyo in developing this general idea further, and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> said that he
                            would so recommend to his Government.</p>

                            formal action, a United States complaint of such an attack. On September
                            25 and November 7, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> requested the Secretary General to circulate to

                        <p>1555. Subject: Defense Budget, Japan fiscal year 1955. Finance Minister
                            Ichimada invited me and senior staff to lunch yesterday for primary
                            purpose discussing Japanese contribution to local cost <pb xml:id="pg_1819" n="1819" facs="0763"/>of US security forces Japan
                            in light of country’s economic situation and new government’s financial
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>After preliminary reaffirmation of his own desire maintain closest most
                            cooperative relations with America Ichimada said that maintenance of
                            austerity program, including 1 trillion yen budget limit, was firm
                            determination of new government. In <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>
                            1955 policy should result in 5 to 6 percent reduction in price level and
                            small favorable balance-of-payments position. Larger imports would be
                            more than compensated by larger exports and in 56 more substantial
                            favorable position.</p>
                        <p>As Finance Minister he was faced with severe difficulties in maintaining
                            budget ceiling. Already level of totally unemployed had reached 250,000
                            with 450,000 estimated next year while partial unemployed now totaled 5
                            million, many of them on work relief for 40 yen daily dole. Housing
                            situation continued critical and resultant overcrowding was contributory
                            factor to 1,800,000 tubercular cases only 10 percent of which could be
                            isolated in hospitals. Among other social problems mentioned was
                            disaster relief which preoccupied prefectural authorities and while on
                            surface recovery of 1953 flood areas was impressive, nevertheless
                            effects of this disaster would take 10 years to wipe out. Foregoing, he
                            said, was all part of background which government had to consider before
                            deciding defense budget. Popular support obviously essential and if
                            government appeared to bow to US pressure or spent too much money on
                            defense rather than on people’s welfare, adverse feelings of people
                            would be directed against United States and US policies.</p>
                        <p>Because of foregoing, defense budget would have to be limited although
                            he, Ichimada, wished to build forces and thus enable US to withdraw. In
                            particular he wished to decrease Japanese contribution to local costs of
                            US security forces as this was area in which sizable economies could be
                            realized.</p>
                        <p>When administrative agreement was negotiated in 1952, first draft
                            presented to Japanese included in Article XXIII, paragraph 2 provision
                            that “certain basic expenses of the US Armed Forces stationed in Japan .
                            . .<note n="1" xml:id="d847fn1">Ellipsis in the source text.</note>
                            shall be borne by the US and that the local costs incident to the
                            maintenance of such forces in Japan shall in principle be borne on the
                            basis of parly [<hi rend="italic">parity?</hi> ] by the US and Japan.”
                            Ichimada went on to say that Japan had been unable to agree to provision
                            in this form because of uncertainty in amount of its 50 percent share
                            and so agreed instead to $55 million now specified in Article 25.
                            However, this figure had been derived on basis of old termination of war
                            account headings with estimated security forces requirement for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1952. Resultant total of $361.7 million
                                <pb xml:id="pg_1820" n="1820" facs="0764"/>resulted in $180 million
                            when split 50–50 from which $25 million was deducted for value of
                            rentals, leaving net of $155. Ichimada said that in view of his history
                            he felt Japan could reasonably expect its contribution to be reduced to
                            extent that expenditures under old TOW headings had dropped off and that
                            Japan had right to question whether its contribution was being used for
                            other purposes, particularly by ground forces. It would be equitable, he
                            thought, for departure of one division from Japan as announced in press
                            to result in commensurate reduction in Japanese contribution to US
                            security forces costs, bearing in mind negotiating history
                            administrative agreement. He said that estimates recently received by
                            Ministry of Finance apparently contained items not contemplated in the
                            agreement and asked that US study matter and relate its expected receipt
                            of Japanese funds to costs calculated on foregoing basis.</p>
                        <p>Ichimada developed at some length thesis that <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1955 was most critical for national economy and that if
                            his policies were enabled to succeed, in part by reasonable attitude of
                            US on defense matters, year 1956 would see real improvement and basis
                            for gradual expansion Japanese defense capabilities. In parallel with
                            foregoing, he developed thought that forthcoming election was “last
                            chance” for Japanese conservatives and if they did not succeed with
                            anticipated March mandate, they would not again be in position solve
                            nation’s problems, that is, by implication, on basis consistent with US
                            desires. (Separate telegram will report further on this thesis which has
                            come to me from several sources lately.)<note n="2" xml:id="d847fn2">No

                        </p>
                        <p>While Ichimada said that he did not expect any definite answers from me
                            today and wished instead to present foregoing for our serious
                            consideration, I told him that there were several points which I wished
                            to make at outset before we got into serious negotiations over defense
                            program. I said I realized these could only take definitive shape after
                            election but in meantime it was important to lay groundwork and discuss
                            various aspects on exploratory basis. Points I wished to make were as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>Just as Finance Minister had stressed Japanese Government problems of
                            domestic support, so in US did we face serious problems in obtaining
                            support for things which Japanese wanted even though in best interests
                            of both countries. Administrative agreement clearly obligated Japan to
                            annual contribution of $155 million and last year, as contribution to
                            assist Japanese in increasing their defense program, we had agreed
                            forego $7 million. However, Japanese had unilaterally cut defense
                            appropriation by 4.5 billion <pb xml:id="pg_1821" n="1821" facs="0765"/>yen which meant Japanese commitment to US was not being met. Thus
                            Congress could point to disappointing Japanese performance after last
                            year’s negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Japanese Government should realize that US was extending <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> assistance to many friendly governments
                            all over world and government and Congress naturally scrutinized
                            relative performance of our various partners. It would be noted for
                            instance that countries with approximately same level per capita income
                            such as Turkey, were expending much greater percentage this income on
                            their defenses and natural tendency our legislators was to appropriate
                            money for countries which showed desire do utmost contribute to their
                            own defense and relieve us of as much of burden as possible.</p>
                        <p>As third point, our people back home would be willing to consider
                            reduction of contribution to US forces here only if Japanese were
                            expanding own forces. Administrative agreement contemplated that
                            contribution to US forces would be reduced as Japanese built up and we
                            were prepared consider a formula whereby we would match increase in
                            Japanese defense budget over last year by equivalent reduction in
                            contribution to US forces. Thus in effect US would share 50 percent of
                            cost of increased forces.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as last point, I said that our consideration of Japanese
                            requests in defense field had been handicapped by unwillingness Japanese
                            to plan ahead more than one year or to discuss with US, without definite
                            commitment on either side, tentative longer-term goals. I said that if
                            we knew Japanese long range plans, figures for any one year would be
                            much more meaningful. Since efficient defense of Japan was of interest
                            to both countries, although of primary interest to Japan, it seemed to
                            me we should jointly develop plans which would be mutually agreeable and
                            yet reach common goal with maximum possible expedition. I knew that
                            neither of us could commit ourselves definitely to future years but we
                            could both accomplish much by establishment of common goals.</p>
                        <p>In response to last point Ichimada said <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government had never been willing to consider
                            longer term planning because its strict interpretation of Article 9 of
                            Constitution prevented possesion of “war potential”. However, new
                            government had different interpretation, was committed to rearmament,
                            and was therefore free to discuss longer range plans. He suggested that
                            without attribution to him, we stress to Defense Minister Omura,
                            importance of longer-term goals and joint planning.</p>
                        <p>Both Ichimada and Suzuki who was present, appeared to grasp formula of
                            setting base figure and then sharing increase in Japanese defense
                            program 50 percent by increasing Japanese budget and 50 percent by
                            remission of contribution to US forces. Neither <pb xml:id="pg_1822" n="1822" facs="0766"/>he nor Suzuki who took careful notes, put
                            forward any base figure but latter said that Budget Bureau analysis of
                            Defense Agency’s draft yen 95.2 billion budget indicated estimated level
                            of performance could be reached with 89 billion.</p>
                        <p>I did not wish on this first occasion, particularly in talking with
                            Finance rather than Defense and Foreign Ministers, to mention any base
                            figure or be drawn into defense negotiations. However, foregoing was
                            obviously initial Japanese position which appears to be that for reasons
                            set forth herein in addition to those in part 1 Embassy-<gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> message of December 15 (Embassy

                            billion yen is unrealistic. I am of course making this telegram

                            immediately but pending his reaction I suggest Department and Defense
                            review Embassy telegram 1403 and also those portions enclosures to
                            Embassy despatch 516, October 25 which forecast many of reasons why
