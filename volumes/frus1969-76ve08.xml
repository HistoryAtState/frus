                <p>December 21, 2007</p>
                <p>The Department of State released today <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>, 1969-1976, Volume E–8, Documents on South Asia, 1973-1976, as an electronic-only publication. This volume is the latest publication in the subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important foreign policy decisions and actions of the administrations of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Gerald Ford</persName>. Volume E–8 is the eighth <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be published in the electronic only format, available to all free of charge on the Internet. Approximately 25 percent of the volumes scheduled for publication for the 1969-1976 subseries, covering the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations, will be in this format.</p>
                <p>This e-volume documents the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations toward South Asia, 1973-1976, and should be read in conjunction with <ref target="frus1969-76ve07">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969-1976, Volume E–7</ref>, Documents on South Asia, 1969-1972, and <ref target="frus1969-76v11">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969-1976, Volume XI</ref>, South Asia Crisis, 1971, also available online. In addition to coverage of U.S. policy toward India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, Volume E–8 provides documents on U.S. relations with the smaller South Asian states of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka, and the Indian Ocean region, including the Republic of the Maldives.</p>
                <p>The documents on India and Pakistan for this e-volume are combined into two chapters covering U.S. relations with both countries, with the landmark Indian nuclear weapons test of May 1974 as a point of division. The India-Pakistan War of 1971 cast a long shadow and defined the relationship of the United States to both countries for the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations. The chief concerns of the United States were the enforcement of the 1972 Simla Agreement and the re-establishment of normal relations between India and Pakistan. Bilateral relations with India improved considerably from their 1971 nadir, until the 1974 Indian nuclear test. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s appointment of <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</persName> as Ambassador to India in 1973 led to the resolution of several long-standing economic and political tensions, although New Delhi continued to object to U.S. support for Pakistan and alleged a U.S. role in its domestic instability. India's successful nuclear test was a setback for bilateral relations, amplifying U.S. concerns about <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Indira Gandhi</persName>'s close relationship with the Soviet Union, her declaration of martial law in 1975, and her decision to develop nuclear technology while dependent on U.S. food aid.</p>
                <p>Relations between the United States and Pakistan were generally good, with President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto visiting Washington in February 1975. Nevertheless, U.S. policymakers remained anxious about Pakistani instability following the 1971 war, and about <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s viability as a national leader. Washington was also concerned about <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s attempts to quell domestic regional disturbances, particularly in Pakistan's northwestern frontier provinces, and to establish his legitimacy as a nationalist and populist reformer. Nevertheless, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s policy of providing military and economic support to Pakistan was continued during the <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration.</p>
                <p>The themes of the Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Indian Ocean chapters expand on those developed in previous volumes on South Asia. In Afghanistan, the major event was the dissolution of the monarchy and its replacement by the republican government of <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Mohammad Daoud</persName>. The change in regime did not cause an alteration in U.S. policy, which, as in the past, attempted to offset Soviet influence in Afghanistan with diplomatic support and development assistance. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration quickly recognized the new Afghan government and continued to provide it with development aid and opium eradication assistance, while mediating the continual Afghan dispute with Pakistan over both countries' Pushtun borderlands.</p>
                <p>In Bangladesh, the United States also sought to establish solid diplomatic relations with a new government, that of Prime Minister Mujibur Rahman (frequently referred to in the documentation as Mujib), while seeking to limit the influence of other regional powers over the desperately impoverished country by providing food and development aid. The U.S. relationship with Dhaka was complicated by Bangladeshi suspicion of U.S. motives, as well as by the 1975 overthrow and murder of Mujib, followed by the establishment of a military regime.</p>
                <p>In dealing with Sri Lanka, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations found the U.S. relationship with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Sirimavo Bandaranaike</persName> complicated by the latter's presidency of the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as her continued attempts to establish an Indian Ocean Peace Zone and her criticism of the U.S. expansion of the British base at Diego Garcia. At the same time, U.S. policymakers attempted to assess and contain the expanding Soviet naval presence and influence in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                <p>Finally, volume E–8 provides detailed coverage of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations' relations with Nepal and Bhutan, the first such coverage in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series since the volumes covering the Eisenhower administration.</p>

                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">George H.W. Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg in 1928: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purpose of concealing a defect in policy. The 1991 statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events recorded.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Series</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This electronic-only volume is part of the subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important decisions and actions of the foreign policy of the administrations of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M. Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Gerald R. Ford</persName>. This is the latest <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be published in a new format, that of electronic-only publication. Approximately 25 percent of the volumes scheduled for publication for the 1969-1976 subseries, covering the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations, will be in this format. The decision to institute this change was taken in full consultation with the Department's Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, which was established under the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations statute</hi>. The advantages of this new method of presenting documentation are evident in this volume: the format enables convenient access to a large amount of key documentation on a broader range of issues, all or any portion of which can be easily downloaded. Annotation—the value added element of documentary editing—is still present in limited form, but not to the scale of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> print volume. This electronic-only publication results in substantial savings in cost and time of production, thus allowing the series to present a fuller range of documentation on a wider range of topics sooner than would have been possible under a print-only format. These advantages compensate for the fact that this <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume is not an actual book bound in traditional ruby buckram. The Department of State, the Historian, the General Editor, and the Historical Advisory Committee are all dedicated to publishing the great majority of the volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in print form; these are also posted in electronic format on the Department of State's website. While the future of research in documentary publications is increasingly tied to the ease of use and availability of the Internet, the Department of State will continue to use both print and electronic-only versions to make the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series available to the widest audience possible. In that sense, this innovation is in keeping with the general principles of the series, which was begun by President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward and continued by subsequent presidents and secretaries of state for 140 years.</p>

                <p>This e-volume documents the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration toward South Asia, 1973-1976, and should be read in conjunction with <ref target="frus1969-76ve07">Foreign Relations, 1969-1976, Volume E–7</ref>, Documents on South Asia, 1969-1972, and <ref target="frus1969-76v11">

Both of these volumes document in depth the period of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration, including the pivotal months of the India-Pakistan conflict of 1971 and its aftermath. Taken together, these three volumes provide comprehensive coverage of U.S. policy toward India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. In contrast with the previous volumes on South Asia during the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration, which were focused more tightly on the subcontinent's crises, volume E–8 also provides detailed coverage of the smaller South Asian states of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka, and the Indian Ocean region, including the Republic of the Maldives. Read in conjunction with <ref target="frus1969-76v24">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969-1976, Volume XXIV</ref>, 1969-1972 (GPO: forthcoming), this volume will also provide comprehensive coverage of U.S. Indian Ocean strategy during 1969-1976.</p>
                <p>The India-Pakistan War of 1971 cast a long shadow and defined the relationship of the United States to both countries for the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration, additionally complicated by the explosion of an Indian nuclear bomb in 1974. The documents on India and Pakistan for this e-volume are combined into two chapters covering U.S. relations with both countries, with the landmark Indian nuclear weapons test in May of that year serving as the point of division. The chief concerns of the United States were the enforcement of the 1972 Simla Agreement and the re-establishment of normal relations between Islamabad and New Delhi. Bilateral relations with India improved considerably from their 1971 nadir until the 1974 Indian nuclear test. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s appointment of <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</persName> as ambassador to India in 1973 resolved several long-standing economic and political tensions, although New Delhi continued to object to U.S. favoritism toward Pakistan, as well as frequently alleging a U.S. role in its domestic instability. The 1974 nuclear test disturbed relations considerably, serving to amplify U.S. concerns about <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Indira Gandhi</persName>'s close relationship with the Soviet Union, her declaration of martial law in 1975, and her decision to develop nuclear technology while still dependent on U.S. food aid.</p>
                <p>Relations between the United States and Pakistan were generally good during this period, with President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto visiting Washington in February 1975. Nevertheless, U.S. policy makers remained anxious about Pakistani instability following the 1971 War and especially about <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s viability as a leader, even as he attempted to establish his legitimacy as a nationalist and populist reformer. Washington's suspicion foreshadows the 1977 coup and his execution two years later. U.S. diplomats were also concerned about <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s attempts to quell domestic regional disturbances, particularly in Pakistan's western frontier provinces. Nevertheless, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s military and economic support of Pakistan remained U.S. policy during the <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration. Pakistan's envoys constantly pressed <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, and then <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>, to increase U.S. commitments to military aid. Although hesitant to establish a new round of arms sales, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> agreed in 1973 to release all non-lethal military aid purchased by Pakistan up until the 1971 India-Pakistan War.</p>
                <p>The themes of the Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Indian Ocean chapters expand on those developed in previous volumes on South Asia. From 1973-1976, U.S. foreign policy adapted to several changes in the regional power structure, not just in India and Pakistan, but in the smaller states as well. In Afghanistan, the major event was the dissolution of the monarchy in 1973 and its replacement by <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Mohammad Daoud</persName>'s republican government. The change in regime did not cause an alteration in U.S. policy, which, as in the past, attempted to offset Soviet influence in Afghanistan with diplomatic support and development assistance. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration quickly recognized the new Afghan government and continued to provide it with quiet diplomatic support, development aid, and opium eradication assistance, while mediating Kabul's continual dispute with Pakistan over both countries' Pushtun borderlands.</p>
                <p>In Bangladesh, the United States also sought to establish solid diplomatic relations with a new government, that of Mujibur Rahman (Mujib), while seeking to limit the influence of other regional great powers over the desperately impoverished country. Washington's willingness to provide desperately-needed food and development aid, and its overall relationship with the Dhaka government, was tempered by Bangladeshi suspicion of U.S. motives and resentment against the relationship with Pakistan. It was further tested by the 1975 overthrow and murder of Mujib, followed by the establishment of a military regime.</p>
                <p>In Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka, political instability was not as evident as in Afghanistan or Bangladesh, but these lesser-developed countries' desperate need for U.S. development assistance during and after the oil crisis of 1973 raised Washington's awareness of the tenuous stability of these regional regimes and their growing importance to U.S. strategy in the Indian Ocean region. In other ways, coverage of these smaller countries reflects the themes established in previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes. In addition, the Himalayan states looked to the United States for diplomatic reassurances after the Indian annexation of Sikkim. In the Indian Ocean, The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration found its already complex relationship with critic and potential partner, Sri Lankan prime minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Sirimavo Bandaranaike</persName>, complicated by the latter's presidency of the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as her continued attempts to establish an Indian Ocean Peace Zone and her opposition to the U.S. expansion of the British base at Diego Garcia. Despite regional opposition from Sri Lanka and other countries, the United States determined that Diego Garcia was of critical importance in assessing the expanding Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean, and containing its threat.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> electronic-only volumes follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Declassification and Publishing Division. The original text is reproduced exactly, including marginalia or other notations, which are both visible on the facsimile copy of the document and described in the source note. There is also a text version of the document. The editors have supplied a heading, a summary, and a source note with additional relevant information, as required, for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected in the text file. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the text, and a list of abbreviations, persons, and sources accompanies the volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions in roman type are used on the facsimile copy and in the text file to indicate text omitted by the editors because it deals with an unrelated subject. Text that remains classified after declassification review is blacked-out on the facsimile copy and a bracketed insertion (in italic type) appears in the text file. Entire documents selected for publication but withheld because they must remain classified are accounted for by a heading, a source note, and a bracketed note indicating the number of pages not declassified. These denied documents are listed in their chronological place in the volume.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has custody of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The requirements of the PRMPA and implementing regulations govern access to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the privacy rights of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House officials, since these officials were not given the opportunity to separate their personal materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and related implementing public access regulations require NARA to notify formally the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Estate and former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House staff members that the agency is scheduling for public release <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House historical materials. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Estate and former White House staff members have 30 days to contest the release of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> historical materials in which staff members were participants or are mentioned. Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations require NARA to segregate and return to the creator of files private and personal materials. All <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes that include materials from NARA's <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project are processed and released in accordance with the PRMPA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information, subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments. The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 2004 and was completed in 2005, resulted in the decision to withhold 2 documents in full, to excise a paragraph or more in 4 documents, and to make minor excisions in 20 documents. The editors are confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process described, that this volume is an accurate record of the foreign policy of the first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration toward South Asia for the 1969 to 1972 period.</p>

                            <item>I HAD FIRST OPPORUTNITY FOR EXTENEDED CONVERSATION WITH PRIME MINISTER SINCE NEW GOVERNMENT TOOK OFFICE WHEN HE ASKED TO SEE ME JANUARY 9. CONVERSATION ALMOST ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO EXPLANATION OF HIS “FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHY OF GOVERNMENT,” HIS ANALYSIS OF CLOSELY PARALLEL INTERESTS BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT, AND HIS ANALYSIS OF PAST AFHGAN GOVERNMENT WEAKNESSES AND HIS PLANS FOR OVERCOMING THEM. HE STRESSED THAT HE HOPED FOR FREQUENT INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH ME ON VARIOUS PROBLEM AREAS AND WOULD WELCOME MY CANDID ADVICE, COMING FROM REPRESENTATIVE OF NATION WITH WHICH HE BELIEVES HE CAN CONSULT WITH COMPLETE FRANKNESS AND WITHOUT SUSPICION OF ULTERIOR MOTIVES.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SMM2">MUSA SHAFIQ</persName> STATED HE VERY PLEASED BY TONE OF CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES FROM PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>, SECRETARY ROGERS, AND SEVERAL OTHER AMERICAN OFFICIALS. HE ASKED ME TO TELL THE PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY SISCO HOW MUCH HE FELT STRENGTHENED BY TONE AND CONTENTS OF THEIR MESSAGES. RETURNING TO THEME HE HAS OFTEN EXPRESSED HERE AND DURING HIS VISITS TO US, HE SAID HE FELT STRONGLY THERE EXISTED A FIRM BASIS OF COMMON INSTUTITUIONS AND IDEALS BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES DESPITE THE ENORMOUS GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM, AND THAT HE SAW EVERY REASON WHY AFGHAN-AMERICAN TIES SHOULD BE CONTINUALLY STREGTHENED.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>IN REFERRING TO HIS RELUCTANCE TO BECOME <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, HE SAID THAT ONCE THE JOB HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS SHOULDERS, AS A DRAFTER OF THE CONSTITUTION HE BELIEVED IT WAS HIS DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE LAST CHANCE TO MAKE IT WORK. SINCE THE CONSTITUTION WAS PROMULGATED, AFGHAN PUBLIC LIFE HAS RESEMBLED A ROCKET WHICH DEVIATED FROM ITS PROGRAMMED PATH. THE FIRST PRIROTY OF GOVERNMENT WAS TO CORRECT THE TRAJECTORY AND THEN IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER COME TO GRIPS WITH MORE BASIC CAUSES OF THE MALFUCTION.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SMM2">MUSA SHAFIQ</persName> CHARACTERIZED AGHANISTAN AS A SOCIETY IN WHICH EVERYONE PURSUES HIS OWN INTERESTS, OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT INDIVIDUALS GAIN MOST AS PARTS OF A PROSPEROUS AND PROGRESSIVE NATION. HIS COUNTRY WOULD BE IN GRAVE DIFFICULTY IF IT HAD “BAD NEIGHBORS.” FORTUNATELY, HE SAID, AFGHAN RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES WERE GOOD. HE WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT ANY TROUBLES WITH NEIGHBORS WOULD START WITHIN AFGHANISTAN ITSELF: NEIGHBORS WOULD MAKE REAL TROUBLE ONLY IF “WE COLLAPSE INTERNALLY.” FOR THIS REASON, IT WAS ALL THE MORE IMPROTANT TO PUT OWN HOUSE IN ORDER.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>THE <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> STRESSED HIS TOTAL DECIATION TO HIS TASK. HE SAID HE HAD ABANDONED ALL PRIVATE LIFE TO WORK FROM EARLY MORNING UNTIL 11 OR 12 AT NIGHT, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. HE ASKED ME TO TELL MY GOVERNMETN AND PEOPLE THAT HIS CABINET WAS NOT JUST ANOTHER “RESHUFFLED GROUP” MAKING HOPEFUL NOISES WHICH WOULD THEN MERELY LAPSE INTO CUSTOMARY STAGNATION. HIS GOVERNMENT HAD A “DO OR DIE” DETERMINATION TO TACKLE THE COUNTRY'S ILLS ON A SYSTEMATIC, LOGICAL BASIS. A TRAGEDY OF PAST <pb n="3" xml:id="d1-03" facs="d1-03"/>GOVERNMENTS HAD BEEN THAT THEY HAD NOT DEMANDED MORE OF THEMSELVES AND OF THE AGHAN PEOPLE, FOR BOTH THE PEOPLE AND THEIR KIND HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR MUCH MORE SACIFICE. HE RETURNED AGAIN TO STRESS HIS HOPE THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WOULD UNDERSTAND A TURNING POINT IN HIS COUTNRY HAD BEEN FINALLY REACHED, AND THAT THERE WAS NOW AN OPPORTUNTIY FOR MANY IDEALS SHARED BETWEEN THE AMERICAN AND AGHAN PEOPLE TO FIND ROOT AND PROSPER HERE.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>AS AN EXAMPLE OF HIS PRIORITIES, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> STRESSED HIS CONVICTION THAT ENTIRE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE REQUIRED DRASTIC RECONSTRUCTION, BEGINNING WITH OFFICE OF <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>. AFGHAN MINSTERS, HE SAID, HAD TRADITIONALLY PROVED INCAPABLE OF INNOVATION BECAUSE OF THEIR PREOCCUPATION WITH PETTY PERSONAL CONCERNS. PLANNING AND DIRETION MUST COME FROM THE TOP, AND HAD BEEN TOTALLY LACKING IN PAST CABINETS. HE THEREFORE WAS GIVING TOP PRIORITY TO A MAJOR OVERHAULING OF <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>'S OFFICE SO THAT SUCH DIRECTION AND PRIORTY-SETTING COULD BE ACHIEVED.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>
                                <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> SAID HE HAD NO SPECIFIC REQUESTS TO MAKE OF US AT THIS TIME, RATHER HE WAS ANXIOUS TO REACH THE GREATEST PHILOSPHICAL UNDERSTANDING POSSIBLE WITH OUR GOVERNMENT. HE BELIEVED THAT A STRONGER AND MORE STABLE AFGHANISTAN COULD BE USEFUL TO THE US IN MANY WAYS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. HE SAID HE SAW NO CONTRADICITON WITH AFGHAN INTERESTS IN SAYING THIS: SINCE HE WAS CONVINCED THERE WERE NO BASIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, HE HOPED THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WOULD TRY TO THINK OF WAYS IT COULD HELP AFGHANISTAN PUT ITS HOUSE IN ORDER, EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF GOING BEYOND OUR NORMAL PROCEDURES, BUT HE ALSO HOPED WE WOULD SUGGEST WAY IN WHICH AFGHANISTAN COULD HELP US IN MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST AND CONCERN. (COMMENT: THIS DELICATE MESSAGE REPEATS EARLIER COMMENTS OF <persName corresp="#p_SMM2">MUSA SHAFIQ</persName>'S OVER PAST YEAR IN WHICH HE HAS SUGGESTED A MORE ACTIVE DIPLOMATIC ROLE FOR AFGHANISTAN COULD BE HELPFUL TO US ON SUCH THORNY DIPLOMATIC PROBLEMS AS ARAB-ISRAELI DISPUTE.)</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>TOWARD END OF CONVERSATION <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> RETURNED TO THEME THAT GOOD BEHAVIOR OF NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES COULD EASILY CHANGE IF AFGHANISTAN STABILITY AND PROGRESS WERE UNDERMINED. HE CREDITED BOTH <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> AND PAKISTAN WITH GOOD BEHAVIOR, BUT SAID THAT IN BOTH COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE USSR, THERE WERE <pb n="4" xml:id="d1-04" facs="d1-04"/>ELEMENTS WHO WOULD NEED LITTLE PROVOCATION TO TAKE A DIFFERENT LINE. IN THIS CONNECTION HE WAS WARY OF NEW SOVIET AMBASSADOR PUSANOV DESPITE HIS SEEMINGLY FRIENDLY EXTERIOR. SENDING A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST'S PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE AS AMBASSADOR, ESPECIALLY ONE WHO HAS SERVED ONLY IN COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, GAVE HIM FOOD FOR THOUGHT. HE WAS NOT ALTHOGETHER CERTAIN WHETHER THIS WAS GOOD OR BAD, BUT IN ANY EVENT IT MADE IT MORE IMPORTANT THAT AFGHANISTAN'S INTERNAL STABILITY BE REINFORCED.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>IN RESPONSE TO <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>'S CANDOR, I SAID I WAS CERTAIN OUR GOVERNMENT WOULD PROVIDE EITHER FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY WHATEVER ADIVCE MIGHT BE USEFUL TO <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> IN HIS EFFORTS TO REORGANIZE AND STRENGTHEN HIS GOVERNMENT. BEING THOROUGHLY AWARE OF THE DELICATE POLITICAL EXTERNAL BALANCE WHICH HAPPILY EXISTED IN AFGHANISTAN, WE WOULD WISH TO OFFER OUR ADIVCE IN AS DISCREET WAY AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF TOO PROMINENT ROLES FOR FOREGINERS. THE <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> SAID HE SHARED COMPLETELY MY ANALYSIS, AND WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF THIS MATTER AND OTHER AREAS IN WHICH US ADIVCE WAS NEEDED, AS WELL AS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN WHICH REQUIRED HIS EARLY ATTENTION.</item>

                            <item>We are pleased with IG advocacy of early attention to the urgent need to eradicate cultivation of opium poppies in the U.S.-sponsored Helmand Valley project area. Mission has itself been advocating positive Washington inter-agency support and action to counter growing narcotics problem in Afghanistan since beginning of year—as you well aware and as voluminous cable traffic attests. The poppy problem in Afghanistan is not a Helmand Valley problem nor is it a problem to be approached—with panic mentality—in terms of the Helmand valley project (where poppy cultivation problem generally and increase this year appears to be among most minimal <pb n="2" xml:id="d3-02" facs="d3-02"/>in Afghanistan). The poppy problem is country wide. Its most serious manifestations, moreover, are outside the project area being supported by <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss>. While planting to the poppy is estimated at 10-15% of total cultivation in some locations outside the U.S.-assisted project area, plots within the project area show zero to 1-2% cultivation in poppies. A clear indication that U.S. financially-supported improvements have helped Helmand Valley Project farmers to earn a liveable income without resort to illegal crops. “Irrigation, drainage, land levelling, use of fertilizers and improved seeds, and teaching of better framing practices” has given the farmers of the U.S.-supported area more ability to resist the extraordinary economic incentives of poppy cultivation. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> inputs are, of course, neutral inputs—at worst they improve the farmers' capacity at whatever he undertakes but at best they give farmers viable alternatives to clandestine/illegal operations.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The observation of extensive cultivation of illicit opium poppies on project lands in the Helmand Valley is erroneous. The Helmand Valley is extensive; the project area limited; poppy cultivation on project lands is relatively extremely limited.</item>

                            <item>Large U.S. financial outlays at the expense of the U.S. taxpayers, <pb n="3" xml:id="d3-03" facs="d3-03"/>to suppress opium production in such countries as Turkey, Thailand and Mexico suggest a simple economic explanation for what may be extraordinarily heightened rewards to the illicit cultivator of opium poppies in remote and underdeveloped Afghanistan where the fragility of life is great—survival itself a dangerous game, and where rural economic desperation following two drought years may have provided considerable special incentive to high value poppy cultivation this year.</item>

                            <item>At the time of Messrs. Kraft and Marvin's inspection, opium poppies were in full bloom in one, repeat one, field they photographed in the Shamalan project area. The photography could not have been duplicated often in other parts of the project area. AID technicians, along with a Peace Corps Volunteer, were indeed working directly with the Afghan farmer, teaching land levelling and other improved agricultural techniques in an adjacent field. The farmer is a leader—one of the most progressive farmers in the project area. The fact that he was cultivating a small plot of poppies at the time would now rule out his receiving any U.S.-financed advice. (<gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> Director, in May, banned U.S. support to individual farmers cultivating poppies in the project area.) While our people expressed disapproval over his poppy cultivation, they were aware that negotiations underway leading to <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> contravention of poppy <pb n="4" xml:id="d3-04" facs="d3-04"/>cultivation—nationwide (support for which is under consideration in Kabul, Geneva, Washington and other capitals) would likely rule out his cultivation of poppies in the future. Moreover they were aware that responding to an eagerness for help in acquiring new, modern techniques would enhance his ability to prosper without resort to illegal means.</item>

                            <item>The northern part of the Helmand Valley, from Girishk to the vicinity of the U.S-financed Kajakal Dam is not a part of the Helmand-Arghandab Project area receiving U.S. assistance. It has benefitted, of course, from proximity, but it is not a receiver of U.S. aid.</item>

                            <item>Poppy cultivation in the Helmand Valley as all over Afghanistan is more extensive this year than it was last year. Exogenous forces ought, we suspect, be looked to for the explanation.</item>

                            <item>The Mission has, in as the IG reports, been concerned with poppy cultivation in Afghanistan for a number of years. The Mission is, as the report indicates, anxious to support a comprehensive, long-term plan to eliminate poppy cultivation throughout all of Afghanistan, such as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is now suggesting. A piecemeal effort by the U.S. in so minimally affected an area as that encompassed by our project—where a withdrawal of U.S. advice will hurt the majority of innocents in order to punish a few guilty—ill suits the U.S. image and character. It would be particularly inappropriate at a point in time where the Palace and the Prime Ministry have expressed determination to take definitive steps, country-wide, with help from the international community, to eliminate the cultivation of the poppy in Afghanistan.</item>

Mission has made clear to <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> that continuation of assistance is critically dependent upon eradication of poppy production not in one small area—but throughout the country. They have asked for the help needed to do this. We are urging a full measure of U.S. commitment to this important end.</item>

                                <p>Wrap-up and additional background: A. The Mission has and is taking steps directed against opium production in the <pb n="8" xml:id="d3-08" facs="d3-08"/>Helmand Valley. If new project for the Valley is programmed—beginning in July 1974—steps by <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> to eliminate poppy production in area to be precondition to new project activities. <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss>, some months back, issued instructions precluding technical assistance from U.S. advisors to poppy growers. Plan requires borrowers, under proposed small farmer credit program, to sign in loan instrument, a covenant requiring that inputs will not be utilized in growing poppies or other “illegal crops”. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> aiding and urging <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> to reach agreement on proposed national poppy eradication program.</p>
                                <p>B. <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> staff members prepared report on poppy production (Poppies in Afghanistan, Owens and Clifton, published June 1972) based on interviews with farmers in all known poppy producing areas in the country except Badakshan, where not permitted entry. At that time opium production in Helmand Valley appeared to be decreasing because of 1) low price for gum in bazaar; 2) enforcement efforts of Government of Iran; and 3) farmers considered opium an unpleasant crop to raise.</p>
                                <p>C. This year, however, evidence began to mount indicating that something (which we are unable to firmly establish) had happened <pb n="9" xml:id="d3-09" facs="d3-09"/>to trigger an increase in acreage of opium poppy. The number of poppy fields country-wide appeared to have increased several fold. May 4 overflight of Helmand-Arghandab area (reported Kabul 4094) also included among passangers, Mr. Abdul Chafoor, Deputy MinAg and Irriagion, Mr. Ali Ahmad Khurram, Deputy MinPlanning and Mr. Y.S. Zamir, liaison officer in the MinPlan for the</p>
                                <p>Helmand-Arghandab Valley Authority. Plane flew from Kajakai Reservoir down Sanguin Valley, over Mara and Nad-i-Ali project areas and then Shamalan at an altitude of about 800 feet above ground level. Poppy fields plainly were visible and rather easily identified by all air passengers at this height; crude estimate (basis overflight and ground reconnaissance) indicated that up to 10-15 percent of land was in poppy in some parts of the Sanguin Valley (north of an outside of) Helmand-Arghandab Valley Authority project area) while in U.S-assisted <gloss target="#t_HAVA1">HAVA</gloss> project area, poppy production varied from nothing to perhaps a high of 1% to 2%. Previous year estimates were only one tenth of this year's.</p>
                                <p>D. Mission over past many months has been aware of growing problem of opium production in Afghanistan and has discussed its seriousness at many Afghan levels, from the King and the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> down through <pb n="10" xml:id="d3-10" facs="d3-10"/>
                                    <gloss target="#t_HAVA1">HAVA</gloss> leadership, to local agricultural extension agents and opium producing farmers.</p>
                                <p>E. It is an unfortunately fact that much modern agricultural technology may be just as effective when applied to opium poppy as when applied to wheat or corn for which originally developed. It probably is true that if poppy is planted in field where modern techniques were used to grow wheat in previous years, yield of opium will be somewhat higher because of residual fertilizer, reduced stand of weeds, and slightly improved level of land.</p>
                                <p>F. As far as we have been able to determine, in these circumstances, the poppy production problem cannot be overcome even by resort to (a) a general withholding knowledge of new technology and (b) withholding actual inputs (in this case fertilizer and water). Realistically, (a) and (b) constitute panicky, desperate impracticable steps. An effective enforcement program to prevent production is necessary and difficult but will work only to extent farmer can make living from other crops. Americans in Valley can influence a number of decisions affecting development activities but they cannot shut off supplies from bazaar (seed and fertilizer) and they cannot shut off water. Even <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> would have difficulty denying water either because traditional <pb n="11" xml:id="d3-11" facs="d3-11"/>irrigation structures are beyond practical <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> control or because closing off one guilty farmer may shut off the water from dozens of his innocent neighbors. It is even impossible for U.S. to completely close off supply of new technology to offending farmers since they can learn from their neighbors or by seeing new ways of doing things from bus window.</p>
                                <p>G. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not “permit” anything in sovereign Afghanistan. We either assist or refrain from assisting.<gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> Director has issued orders that no one in Mission will knowingly work with any farmer cultivating opium poppies. We also expect proposed small farmer credit program to contain provision that credit will not be given to farmers who expect to produce opium and that fertilizer purchased on credit is not to be used for opium production.</p>
                                <p>H. Indictment of the Valley authorities and AID by the inspectors—on (truistic, perverse) grounds that “AID's decision regarding assistance to farmers of the Helmand Valley have largely ignored fact that U.S.-financed improvements may also help these same farmers raise better opium poppy crops"—ignores fact that current thinking within AID, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and other nations and donors is that in the long run, only hope for getting rid of opium, even with a strong enforcement program is <pb n="12" xml:id="d3-12" facs="d3-12"/>to teach farmers how to feed and clothe family without resorting to poppy production and by making necessary inputs readily available so that this is possible.</p>
                                <p>I. For over a year, the Mission has been discussing with <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> possible development of new projects in Helmand and in agriculture for whole country. As discussions continue and if negotiations commence on the Helmand Valley, banning of poppy production in project area is expected to be major point. For some parts of country, not Helmand, Development of Afghan research capability is essential. Assistance will also be required in order for agricultural extension service to improve information gathering and dissemination capability so that farmers can be taught sufficiently profitable methods of farming to keep them from turning to poppy desperation.</p>
                                <p>J. Area where inspectors found highest concentration of poppy (between Girishk and Kajakai) is not in <gloss target="#t_HAVA1">HAVA</gloss> project although it is in Helmand Valley. (Much of poppy produced elsewhere in the Valley is outside of the project area as water on the fringes is available intermittently but not regularly enough to produce good crops of wheat or other foods.)</p>
                                <p>K. U.S. assists <gloss target="#t_HAVA1">HAVA</gloss> but is not involved in civil governing of area. Although President of <gloss target="#t_HAVA1">HAVA</gloss> is also Governor of Helmand Province <pb n="13" xml:id="d3-13" facs="d3-13"/>Mission staff in no way serve as counterparts to the Governor. They are counterparts only to President of <gloss target="#t_HAVA1">HAVA</gloss> and his staff who are charged with developing project area in an engineering and agricultural sense. The major effort to make changes in enforcement and local administration must be made in Kabul. The Mission is using all the leverage under its control to encourage these changes.</p>
                                <p>L. The Mission still hopes that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>/FAO proposal (already accepted by <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>) will be accepted by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies and other donors, and that action on it will start shortly after the Geneva meetings in July.</p>

PRELIMINARY INDICATES ARE THAT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT POSITION OF PASHTUN TRIBES IN EAST AND SOUTH IS SUPPORTIVE AND IT APPEARS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT DAUD WOULD HAVE ENGINEERED COUP WITHOUT HAVING KNOWN WHICH WAY MANY OF THEM WOULD LEAN. ON OTHER HAND, KING AND <persName corresp="p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> WALI HAVE ASSIDUOUSLY CULTIVATED TRIBAL SUPPORT, PRIMARILY IN PAKTIA AND KANDAHAR AREAS FOR MANY YEARS. ABDUL WALI HIMSELF FOR YEARS HAS PERSONALLY RECRUITED ARMY OFFICERS FROM PAKTIA PROVINCE ON WHOSE SUPPORT HE COULD RELY; AND SO LONG AS KING AND ABDUL WALI REMAINED ALLIED, PROSPECTS FOR A COUP FROM OTHER OUTSIDERS SEEMED QUITE REMOTE UNTIL TODAY, OF COURSE.</item>

AT SAME TIME, DAUD AND HIS SUPPORTERS WILL BE MOVING QUICKLY TO CONVENE TRIBAL JIRGAHS AND OBTAIN OATHS OF FEALTY FROM AS MANY AS POSSIBLE OF KING'S AND ABDUL WALI'S TRADITIONAL SUPPORTERS. AT PRESENT, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS LIKELIHOOD OF WIDESPREAD TRIBAL REACTION AGAINST NEW REGIME BUT IT AT LEAST CONCEIVEABLE THAT OPPOSITION WILL CROP UP AND WILL HAVE TO BE SUPPRESSED OVER PERIOD OF NEXT FEW MONTHS.</item>

MAIN FOREIGN POLICY QUESTION IN REGION FOR NEW REGIME WILL BE WHAT TO DO ABOUT PASHTUNISTAN QUESTION WHICH WAS PURSUED WITH HARDLINE FERVOR BY DAUD IN EARLY 1960'S AND WHICH LED TO HIS DOWNFALL IN 1963. PRESUMABLY HE WILL ADOPT STRONG POSITION AGAINST RECENT DIVIDE-AND-RULE TACTICS OF BHUTTO IN <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> AND BALUCHISTAN, BUT IF HE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM HIS EXPIRIENCE OF 10 YEARS AGO, HE WILL APPLY THIS POLICY MORE JUDICIOUSLY, PERHAPS IN FASHION RESEMBLING HIS PREDECESSORS OF RECENT YEARS AT LEAST IN SHORT TERM FUTURE. WE KNOW LITTLE OF DAUD'S ATTITUDE TOWARD IRAN, ALTHOUGH ONE REPORT DESCRIBES HIS ALLEGEDLY VIOLENT OPPOSITION TO RECENTLY NOT YET CONCLUDED HELMAN WATERS TREATY WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN DECREED BY THE KINGS NOR RATIFIED BY IRANIAN PARLIAMENT. IF DAUD SHOULD BOW TO NATIONALIST TREATY THEN HE MIGHT SCRAP IT; ON OTHER HAND, IF HE PURSUES MILITANT POLICY ON PASHTUNISTAN, HE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO SUPPORT TREATY TO OBTAIN POTENTIAL OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF ACCESS TO SEA THROUGH IRAN.</item>

                        <p>SUMMARY: I MET JULY 20 WITH PRINCE <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>, BROTHER AND ALTER EGO OF DAUD. HE RECEIVED ME WARMLY, EXPRESSED STRONG PLEA FOR CONTINUED US ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SUPPORT OF AFGHANISTAN, EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT NEW REGIME FIRMLY IN SADDLE,REITERATED COMMITMENT OF AFGHANISTAN TO NON-ALIGNED PRINCIPLES OF PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND AMICABLE RESOLUTION OF PASHTUNISTAN ISSUE. HE ALSO STRONGLY DENIED SOVIET FOREKNOWLEDGE OF COUP. END</p>
                        <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. I MET WITH PRINCE <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>, 62-YEAR OLD BROTHER PRESIDENT DAUD, REGARDED AS HIS VIRTUAL ALTER EGO (FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON),MORNING JULY 20 AT <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>'S HOME AND AT HIS REQUEST. APPEARING IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND SPIRITS, HE SPOKE WITH OBVIOUS AUTHORITY, AND EXPRESSED GREAT PLEASURE IN SEEING ME AND RECALLED OUR PREVIOUS MEETINGS, PARTICULARLY LAST ONE OF ABOUT YEAR AGO. HE WELCOMED SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 02 KABUL 05325 201434Z</p>
                        <p>OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH ME AND SAID HE WOULD BE AT OUR DISPOSAL ANYTIME, ADDING THAT <gloss target="#t_MFA1">MFA</gloss>'S DR WAHED KARIM (WHO REPORTING TO HIM DAILY) SHOULD BE CHANNEL FOR ARRANGING FUTURE CONTACTS. HE SAID HE HAD NO OFFICIAL FUNCTION IN NEW GOVERNMENT AND EXPECTED TO HAVE NONE IN VIEW EYE AND EAR PROBLEMS.</p>
                        <p>2. HE SAID HE AWARE OF MY QUESTIONS ABOUT NEW GOVERNMENT'S ORGANIZATION AND COMMITMENTS, AND ASSURED ME THAT “OF COURSE” NEW REGIME WOULD HONOR ALL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT.</p>
                        <p>3. HE THEN LAUNCHED INTO BRIEF HISTORICAL DISCUSSION LEADING UP TO CURRENT SITUATION, WHICH TIED INTO OUR LAST MEETING OF YEAR AGO. HE REMINDED ME THAT IN OUR LAST CONVERSATION HE HAD TOLD ME THAT KING WAS IRRESPONSIBLE, THAT PARLIAMENT WAS A JOKE, THAT KING WAS NOT WORKING HARD AND WAS LEADING COUNTRY INTO BANKRUPTCY. HE RECALLED HOW HE HAD THEN URGED ME TO PERSUADE KING MOVE MORE RAPIDLY. WE KNOW YOU DID THAT, HE SAID, BUT YOU WERE UNABLE TO DO MORE THAN TO GET HIM TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY SITUATION BROUGHT ON BY TWO-YEAR DROUGHT. HE SAID CONSTITUTION OF 1964 CREATED ABSOLUTE RULE OF KING. HE DID NOT DELEGATE POWER; HE RAN COUNTRY BUT YET HE DIDN'T RUN IT. THE MINISTRIES WERE DYSFUNCTIONAL AND “PLAYTHINGS” OF CAPRICIOUS KING. HE SAID KING RELIED FOR ENVERYTHING, NOT ON HIS ACHIEVEMENTS OR POPULAR FEELINGS, BUT ON MILITARY SUPPORT. THIS NOT POSSIBLE IN LONG RUN. POPULARITY, HE CONCLUDED, ESPECIALLY IN POOR COUNTRY LIKE AFGHANISTAN, CAN COME ONLY FROM VERY HARD WORK.</p>
                        <p>4. SPEAKING OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, NAIM SAID HUMAN COSTS OF GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER HAVE BEEN PAINFUL, BUT THANK GOD NO ONE SUFFERED SERIOUS HARM. IN TERMS OF PERSONAL INTER-FAMILY FEELINGS, COUNTRY COMES FIRST.</p>
                        <p>5. AFGHAN REPUBLIC, HE CONTINUED, HAS MANDATE TO CREATE POLICY FOR BENEFIT OF PEOPLE, WHICH WILL NOT BE EASY TASK. THERE IS GENERAL ACCEPTANCE OF NEW REGIME AMONG POPULATE BUT NO ACCEPTANCE FOR EXTREMISM OF EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT. THE LEFT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN. THE RIGHT IS TOO BACKWARD AND NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN SOLVING PROBLEMS. THE NEW REGIME WILL TAKE MEASURES TO PREVENT EXTREMISM, BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS TO ERADICATE THAT WHICH FEEDS LEFTISM—POVERTY, SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 03 KABUL 05325 201434Z</p>
                        <p>IGNORANCE AND NEED. IN THIS CONNECTION, HE ADDED, WE NEEED AMERICAN</p>
                        <p>UNDERSTANDING AND HELP DESPERATELY. NOW IS THE LAST CHANCE, HE ADMONISHED, FOR US TO COME TO OUR SIDE AND GIVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC HELP, NOT SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE GREAT WEALTH BUT SOME DECENT LEVEL OF PROSPERITY. HE SAID I KNEW FROM INVALUABLE EXPERIENCE HERE HOW ECONOMIC AID CAN HELP WHEN WELL APPLIED. HE REMINDED ME THAT IT BETTER IN ANY COUNTRY TO APPLY ECONOMIC HELP SOONER THAN TO HAVE TO HELP LATER WITH MASSIVE MILITARY ASSISTANCE. WE MUST SHOW RESULTS TO OUR PEOPLE AND WE ASK FOR SOMETHING FROM U.S. THAT WILL MAKE DECISIVE DIFFERENCE FOR COMMON PEOPLE OF COUNTRY.</p>
                        <p>6. I RESPONDED FIRST BY EXPRESSING SATISFACTION THAT HE WANTED <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AFGHANISTAN, ADDING THAT ONE MINIMAL REQUIREMENT IS TO KNOW WITH WHOM WE MUST DEAL. THINKING HE MAY HAVE BEEN UNAWARE OF GENERA LEVEL OUR CURRENT ASSISTANCE, I GAVE HIM FIGURES OF OUR FY1973 AID PROGRAM, CITING ESPECIALLY OUR RECENT MASSIVE FERTILIZER PROGRAM WHICH WAS ALREADY HAVING SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN AGRICULTURAL SPHERE. IN RESPONSE TO A SPECIFIC QUESTION HE SAID GOVERNMENT ALSO EMPHATICALLY ALSO WANTED CONTINUATION US MAP TRAINING PROGRAM.</p>
                        <p>7. I TOLD HIM THAT IN ADDITION TO <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> ALMOST ALL FOREIGN DONORS WERE DISCOURAGED THAT ALL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR AFGHANISTAN WERE FOREIGN PLANS AND STRESSED NEED THEREFORE FOR SOLID AFGHAN-INITIATED PLANNING WHICH WOULD SET PRIORITIES FOR COUNTRY AND WHICH OF COURSE MUST BE PART OF BASIC AFGHAN GOVERNMENT POLICY DECISIONS. I TOLD HIM THAT NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR NEW PLANNING MECHANCSM.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> INDICATED APPRECIATION FOR MY VIEW AND SAID WHEN DAUD WAS PREVIOUSLY <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, HE WAS ALSO IN CHARGE OF PLANNING. HE INDICATED THAT DAUD WOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY THAT ROLE. HE URGED ME THEREFORE TO SEE PRESIDENT DAUD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>9. WITH REGARD TO <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>'S REMARKS ON PREVIOUS REGIME'S</p>
                        <p>RELIANCE ON MILITARY, I ASKED HIM IF THERE NOT SOME EVIDENCE THAT NEW REGIME WOULD ALSO HAVE TO RELY ON ARMY. HE REPLIED OF COURSE THAT WAS TRUE IN SHORT RUN. HE SAID DAUD'S MILITARY SUPPORTERS SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 04 KABUL 05325 201434Z</p>
                        <p>ACTED WITH GREAT EFFICIENCY AND SHOULD BE GIVEN DUE CREDIT, ACKNOWLEDGING, HOWEVER, THE NEED TO ESTABLISH STRONG CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT.</p>
                        <p>10. AT THIS POINT I ASKED <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>, IN CONTEXT OF AFGHAN HISTORY, HOW HE THOUGHT KING, WHOM HE HAS KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS, WOULD ULTIMATELY REACT TO RECENT EVENTS.HE REPLIED THAT RECENT EVENTS PROVED THAT HE HAS LITTLE POPULAR SUPPORT, SINCE NO ONE STOOD UP AND FOUGHT FOR HIM. WHAT HE DOES IS HIS OWN BUSINESS BUT WE WILL TOLERATE ABSOLUTELY NO FOREIGN INTERFERENCE. I TOLD HIM OF SPECULATION THAT SOVIETS KNEW ABOUT COUP IN ADVANCE AND MIGHT EVEN HAVE ENCOURAGED MOVE. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> REPLIED, “LET ME SPEAK COMPLETELY FRANKLY AND AS ONE GENTLEMAN TO ANOTHER GENTLEMAN THAT THE RUSSIANS KNEW NOTHING MORE ABOUT THIS IN ADVANCE THAN THE KING.”</p>
                        <p>11. I REFERRED TO NUMEROUS QUESTIONS WE HAVE HEARD FROM ABROAD ABOUT DAUD SINGLING OUT PAKISTAN IN HIS SPEECH AS ONLY FOREIGN POLICY PROBLEM OF AFGHANISTAN. I SAID THAT WHILE I HAD EXPECTED MENTION OF PASHTUNISTAN, I HEARD NOTHING AOBUT SETTLING PROBLEM PEACEFULLY. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> MINIMIZED THIS ELEMENT DAUD'S SPEECH, EXPLAINING THAT EVERYING HAPPENED QUICKLY AT TIME IT WAS DRAFTED AND THAT PERHAPS SOMETHING INADVERTENTLY LEFT OUT. HE ADDED AFGHANS AND PAKISTANIS MUST NOT HAVE STIFF ATTITUDE TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND MUST MAKE “SERIOUS EFFORT” TO ACHIEVE PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO EXTENT POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> CONCLUDED MEETING WITH PLEA FOR US NOT TO ABANDON AFGHANISTAN. HE RECALLED WHILE HE AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON DURING DULLES ERA, HE HAD DIFFICULTY IN CONVINCING AMERICANS AFGHANS WERE NOT “GOING OVER TO OTHER SIDE”. BUT, HE SAID, AFGHANISTAN HAD SHOWN BY DEEDS ITS TRUE POSITION. HE NOTED THAT WORLD SITUATION HAD CHANGED SINCE THEN AND THAT NEUTRALITY IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED IMMORAL BY EITHER SIDE. WE REMAIN NEUTRAL, CLEAR AND SIMPLE, AND NOTHING MORE THAN THAT.</p>
                        <p>13. I MENTIONED TO <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> THAT AFGHANS, WHO HAD BEEN A BIT FEARFUL ABOUT PREVIOUS REGIME, WERE CONCERNED (AS WE WERE) THAT THERE WOULD BE LESS PERSONAL CONTACT BETWEEN AFGHANS AND FOREIGNERS UNDER NEW REGIME. HE REPLIED THERE WILL INEVITABLY BE LESS CONTACT INITIALLY, SINCE OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO GET NEW GOVERNMENT FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AND THAT LEADERSHIP WOULD NOT WANT SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 05 KABUL 05325 201434Z</p>
                        <p>ANTAGONISTS TO SABOTAGE THIS EFFORT. HOWEVER, PRACTIVE WILL APPLY ABSOLUTELY EQUALLY TO ALL FOREIGN RESPRESENTATIVES WITHOUG DISCRIMINATION. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> ALSO APOLOGIZED FOR ANY INCONVENIENCES RECENT EVENTS HAD CAUSED, BUT SAID HE BELIEVED NORMALCY WOULD RETURN VERY QUICKLY.</p>

                        <p>1. DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES EMBASSY'S DISCREET CONTACTS WITH DAUD AND <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> AND RECOMMENDATION IN REF. B. WE ALSO APPRECIATE FULL REPORTING FROM EMBASSY INDICATING STEPS REGIME HAS TAKEN TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION AND ITS APPARENT SUCCESS IN EXERTING EFFECTIVE CONTROL THROUGHOUT COUNTRY.</p>
                        <p>2. THE BASIC THRUST OF OUR APPROACH IS TO PLAY ANY QUESTION ABOUT RECOGNITION IN AS LOW A KEY AS POSSIBLE WITH A VIEW TO AVOIDANCE OF SEEMING TO APPROVE OR SECRET</p>
                        <p>SECRET</p>

                        <p>DISAPPROVE THE NEW GOVERNMENT. THIS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH DEPARTMENT PRACTICE FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND WITH S-RES. 205 (1969) “THAT IT IS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT WHEN THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND EXCHANGES DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WITH IT, THIS DOES NOT IMPLY THAT THE UNITED STATES NECESSARILY APPROVES OF THE FORM, IDEOLOGY, OR POLICY OF THAT FOREIGN GOVERNMENT” IN BRIEF, THE DEPARTMENT'S POLICY IS TO MINIMIZE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE RECOGNITION QUESTIONS. UNCERTAINTIES GENERATED BY THE TRADITIONAL RECOGNITION POLICY, WHICH MANY EQUATED WITH APPROVAL, HAVE NOT SERVED UNITED STATES INTERESTS WELL. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT YET FORMALLY MOVED TO FRENCH PRACTICE OF RECOGNIZING STATES RATHER THAN GOVERNMENTS, WE ATTEMPT TO AVOID DIRECT ADDRESS TO THE QUESTION OF RECOGNITION WHEREVER POSSIBLE. GENERALLY, ONCE THE SITUATION HAS CLARIFIED, THE NEW REGIME IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEGUN TO RECOGNIZE OR FORMALLY TO CONTINUE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, WE FIND AN APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVISE THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF OUR INTENTION TO MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. RECOGNITION IS NOT MENTIONED BUT MAY BE IMPLIED. IN SEVERAL RECENT CASES, HOWEVER, WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN ELEMENTS OF CONTINUITY IN THE SITUATION (INCLUDING THE RECENT ABROGATION OF THE MONARCHY IN GREECE) THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT NO QUESTION OF RECOGNITION ARISES. TO DO SO IN THIS CASE WHERE NO ELEMENTS OF CONTINUITY ARE APPARENT WOULD BE ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF A GENERAL POLICY IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT FORMALLY RECOGNIZE GOVERNMENTS BUT MERELY DETERMINES WHETHER TO MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THEM. WE ARE PRESENTLY CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TAKE THIS STEP.</p>
                        <p>3. UNTIL CONSULTATIONS COMPLETED PER REF A, EMBASSY SHOULD MAINTAIN ROUTINE WORKING CONTACTS AND HOLD OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION TO GOVERNMENT OFFICES; AVOID FORMAL ACTS THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS RECOGNITION; AND AVOID STATEMENTS SUGGESTING THAT RECOGNITION IS A MAJOR QUESTION THAT WE SHALL FORMALLY OR DRAMATICALLY DECIDE AND ANNOUNCE.</p>

                        <p>4. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT YOUR EFFORT TO ESTABLISH INFORMAL CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION TO DAUD AND WISH TO EMPHASIZE THAT QUESTIONS OF RECOGNITION DISCUSSED ABOVE DO NOT IN ANY WAY RESTRICT YOUR FLEXIBILITY IN ESTABLISHING INFORMAL CONTACT WITH NEW AUTHORITIES. IN SHORT, CONTACTS ARE BEING MAINTAINED AND WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO YOUR PROVIDING YOUR INTERLOCUTOR WITH A WRITTEN RECORD OF ANY INFORMAL MESSAGE YOU WISH TO COMMUNICATE, WHICH RECORD COULD BE TRANSMITTED TO DAUD. THE THRUST OF YOUR MESSAGE CAN BE THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO FRIENDLY AND CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS.</p>

                        <p>1. WE HAVE CAREFULLY REVIEWED EXCHANGES WE HAVE HAD TO DATE WITH <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> AND <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> ON PAK-AFGHAN RELATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO WEIGHED RECENT ANALYSES FROM BOTH POSTS ON BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASPECTS OF BALUCH-PATHAN PROBLEMS, [text not declassified] SEVERAL DISTURBING ASPECTS STAND OUT: (A) DAUD'S CONTINUING DIFFICULTIES IN CONSOLIDATING HIS POWER APPARENTLY PROPEL HIM TO TAKE HARD LINE ON THE PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE; (B) <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> MAY HAVE MISCALCULATED AFGHAN RESPONSE</p>

                        <p>TO HIS ACTIONS AGAINST TRIBAL OPPONENTS IN FRONTIER; AND (C) ANY RECONCILIATION WITH NAP LEADERS, IN LIGHT OF THE ARRESTS AND <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> EFFORTS IMPOSE AUTHORITY, MAY PROVE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IN NEAR TERM.</p>
                        <p>2. SOME OF IMPLICATIONS OF ABOVE WOULD SEEM TO BE:</p>
                        <p>(A) AT MINIMUM TENSIONS WILL INCREASE BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN; (B) IF <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S CONCEPT OF “FORWARD POLICY” IS PURSUED AND AFGHAN SUPPORT, HOWEVER INDIRECT, FOR BALUCH AND PATHAN TRIBALS IN PAKISTAN CONTINUES, DIRECT ARMED CLASHES BETWEEN FORCES OF <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> AND <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> ARE LIVE POSSIBILITY; (C) FORCEFUL PAK ACTIONS AGAINST AFGHANISTAN WILL PRODUCE NEW INSTABILITIES IN KABUL, IF NOT OVERTHROW OF DAUD, WITH POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT BY MORE RADICAL YOUNG OFFICERS WHO ENGINEERED THE JULY COUP; (D) PROLONGED UNREST IN BALUCHISTAN AND <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss>, DEALT WITH BY REPRESSIVE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> TECHNIQUES, COULD HAVE SEVERELY DAMAGING EFFECTS ON POLITICAL STABILITY THROUGH-OUT PAKISTAN AND PRODUCE DANGEROUS EROSION OF PRIME MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S SUPPORT.</p>
                        <p>3. MOST IMPORTANTLY, PROLONGED INSTABILITY IN RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN WILL INEVITABLY LEAD TO GREATER POLARIZATION OF ENTIRE AREA AND HEIGHTENED INVOLVEMENT OF OUTSIDE POWERS. RELATIVE AFGHAN WEAKNESS MAY INDUCE <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> TO LOOK TOWARD SOVIETS (AND INDIANS) FOR INCREASED SUPPORT AND <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> WILL COUNT ON <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, CHINESE AND IRAN TO TAKE ITS SIDE AGAINST WHAT IT WILL INSISTENTLY PORTRAY AS A SOVIET THREAT. ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF SUCH POLARIZATION IS DIFFICULT TO FORESEE, BUT CLEARLY IT INVOLVES RISKS FOR U.S. AS WELL AS OTHERS.</p>
                        <p>4. IN THIS SITUATION WHAT ARE U.S. OBJECTIVES? WE WOULD DEFINE THEM AS: (A) MAINTENANCE OF REGIONAL STABILITY; (B) PRESERVATION OF THE INTEGRITY OF PAKISTAN; (C) PREVENTION OF EXPANSION OF SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE AREA; AND (D) RESUMPTION OF PROGRESS TOWARD REGIONAL COOPERATION. THE TWO IMMEDIATE AND BASIC FACTORS OPERATING IN PRESENT PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN SITUATION THAT THREATEN THESE OBJECTIVES ARE:</p>
                        <p>(A) AFGHAN “MEDDLING” IN PAKISTAN'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS</p>
                        <p>SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 03 STATE 172577</p>
                        <p>(AS VIEWED BY <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>); AND (B) POSSIBLE MISMANAGEMENT BY THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> OF ITS INTERNAL TRIBAL PROBLEMS TO POINT THAT PAKISTAN IS RIVEN BY CIVIL STRIFE, LEADING SOME AMONG ITS NEIGHBORS TO CONCLUDE THAT THEIR SECURITY INTERESTS CAN BE PROTECTED ONLY BY INVOLVEMENT, IF NOT INTERVENTION. CAPACITY FOR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO BRING INFLUENCE TO BEAR IS LIMITED BUT NOT NEGLIGIBLE. AFGHANISTAN HAS LONG HAD INTEREST IN MAINTAINING U.S. PRESENCE THERE AS ALTERNATIVE TO LOPSIDED SOVIET INFLUENCE. PAKISTAN LOOKS TO U.S., NOT ONLY FOR SIZEABLE ECONOMIC SUPPORT, BUT FOR POLITICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT. PAKISTAN ULTIMATELY LOOKS TO U.S. AS GUARANTOR OF ITS SECURITY IF FACED WITH THREAT FROM SOVIET UNION OR SOVIET-SUPPORTED THREAT.</p>
                        <p>5. IN SEEKING APPROPRIATE POSTURE, U.S. CONFRONTS DILEMMAS. WE WANT TO AVOID BEING PLACED IN MIDDLE OF CONTROVERSY BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN. HOWEVER, A POSTURE THAT IS TOO REMOTE MAY MEAN THAT SITUATION WILL DETERIORATE TO POINT WHERE GREATER U.S. INVOLVEMENT SUBSEQUENTLY BECOMES NECESSARY TO PURSUE OUR BROADER AREA OBJECTIVES. WE THEREFORE BELIEVE IT IMPORTANT THAT PARTIES INVOLVED HAVE CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR CONCERNS NOW.</p>
                        <p>6. FOR KABUL: AS INDICATED IN STATE 165225 WE ACCEPT YOUR JUDGMENT THAT HAVING INFORMED <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> OF YOUR INSTRUCTIONS PURSUANT STATE 164400 IT PREFERABLE TO DEFER APPROACH TO DAUD UNTIL TIME OF YOUR FAREWELL CALL. CONTENTS OF THOSE INSTRUCTIONS, HOWEVER, STAND, AND IN PARTICULAR THE IMPORTANCE WE ATTACH TO PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN FINDING WAYS BILATERALLY TO ASSURE THAT PEACEFUL RELATIONS ARE MAINTAINED BETWEEN THEM SO AS TO PROMOTE STABILITY, PEACE AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION IN REGION. WE LEAVE IT TO AMBASSADOR'S DISCRETION HOW THESE POINTS ARE GOTTEN ACROSS BUT HOPE IT CAN BE DONE IN WAY THAT WILL REMIND GOA BOTH OF IMPORTANCE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> ATTACHES TO MAINTENANCE OF STABILITY IN AND INTEGRITY OF PAKISTAN AND OUR CONCERN THAT TRIBAL DISSIDENCE, WHETHER ENCOURAGED FROM WITHOUT OR WITHIN PAKISTAN,</p>

                        <p>RUNS COUNTER TO THIS OBJECTIVE.</p>
                        <p>7. FOR ISLAMABAD: WITH RESPECT TO <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S EXPRESSED HOPE (ISLAMABAD 6874) THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WILL MAINTAIN POSITION THAT WE WILL NOT ENCOURAGE ANY INTERFERENCE BY KABUL IN PAKISTAN'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> IS WELL AWARE OF OUR RESPECT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP OF PAKISTAN DURING EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TIMES. WE VIEW ANY INTERFERENCE IN PAKISTAN'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS AS INAPPROPRIATE AND AFGHANISTAN LEADERSHIP IS AWARE OF THIS. AT SAME TIME AS A CLOSE FRIEND OF PAKISTAN, WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DID NOT POINT OUT SOME OF THE DANGERS WE SEE FOR PAKISTAN IF IT WERE AGAIN TO BOG DOWN IN PROLONGED AND COSTLY INTERNAL STRUGGLE THAT COULD (HOWEVER INAPPROPRIATELY) INCREASE TENSIONS WITH SOME OF PAKISTAN'S NEIGHBORS.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SHOULD ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR INFLUENCE ON THIS EMOTIONALLY CHARGED ISSUE IN AFGHANISTAN IS LIMITED AND THAT CONTINUED PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN TENSIONS WILL TEND TO EXHAUST U.S. INFLUENCE IN KABUL, WITH A LIKELY INCREASE OF SOVIET INFLUENCE THERE.</p>
                        <p>8. IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT OF CONCERN FOR PAKISTAN'S OWN LONG TERM WELL BEING THAT WE RESPONDED THE WAY WE DID TO DAUD'S REQUEST THAT WE APPROACH <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>. THEREFORE, WE WELCOME INDICATIONS (ISLAMABAD 6998) THAT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SEEKS ACCOMMODATION WITH BALUCHI LEADERS AND IS CONSIDERING WAYS TO STRENGTHEN CONTACTS AND DIALOGUE WITH NEW LEADERSHIP IN KABUL (ISLAMABAD 6997). WE BELIEVE POLICY OF CONTINUED CONCILIATION AND RESTRAINT, WHICH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> INITIATED AT BEGINNING OF HIS PRESIDENCY AND WHICH PROVED SO PRODUCTIVE THEN, IS WISEST POSSIBLE COURSE.</p>

                            <item>SUMMARY: TWO MONTHS AFTER COUP <hi rend="italic">DAUD</hi> SITS ASTRIDE NEW REGIME BUT DOES NOT YET FULLY CONTROL IT. INDICATIONS OF TENSION WITHIN YOUNG MILITARY COUP LEADERS CONTINUE TO ABOUND, THOUGH OUTWARDLY ALL IS CALM. BEHIND SCENES BATTLES GOING ON OVER (A) PACE AND DEGREE OF MARXIST ORIENTATION OF CHANGE, (B) EXTENT OF PURGE OF PEOPLE AND PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH ILL-FATED DECADE-LONG “DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT,” AND (C) DEGREE TO WHICH WESTERN ORIENTATION OF COUNTRY WILL SHIFT NORTHWARD TOWARD <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. PROCESS OF GOVERNMENT FORMATION THEREFORE INEVITABLY SLOW AND COMPLICATED BY INTRICATE FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS BY FERVENT ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN. MAY TAKE UP TO SIX MONTHS TO KNOW WHETHER DAUD FULLY MASTER IN OWN HOUSE. COUNTER-COUP EFFORTS LIKELY IN WEEKS AHEAD, BUT MOST LIKELY FORM WOULD BE “COUP” BY DAUD HIMSELF TO REMOVE SOME OF HIS RADICAL ALLIES. SOVIET ROLE REMAINS MYSTERIOUS, THOUGH MANY ARE CONVINCED THEY HAD INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP TO PLOT. <pb n="2" xml:id="d8-02" facs="d8-02"/>DAUD PROFESSED TO WANT MORE US AND OTHER FOREIGN HELP AND TO BE DETERMINED MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE, WHILE EXTRACTING ALL POSSIBLE SOVIET SUPPORT ON HIS OWN TERMS. WE ACCEPT THIS AS LIKELY TO BE HIS TRUE POSITION, AND THINK ODDS CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN EVEN THAT HE WILL SUCCESSFULLY CONSOLIDATE CONTROL IN WEEKS AHEAD.</item>

                            <item>TWO MONTHS HAVE NOW ELAPSED SINCE THE SUDDEN COUP WHICH BROUGHT MOHAMMAD DAUD BACK TO POWER IN AFGHANISTAN. POLITICAL SITUATION REMAINS UNSTABLE AND IN MANY RESPECTS FRAGILE. THIS UNDERSCORED BY RECENT SRF SUMMARY, AND THAT GLOOMY PICTURE RECEIVES SOME FURTHER DARK BRUSH STROKES IN USAID'S LENGTHY STATUS REPORT ON ALL US ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES IN COUNTRY (REF A). ALTHOUGH THE AID PICTURE IS MIXED, WITH SOME REAL BRIGHT SPOTS, THE TWO REPORTS ARE NOT INHERENTLY CONTRADICTORY. WE ARE OPERATING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH INEVITABLY PRODUCES SOME DIFFERENICES IN PERSPECTIVE, DEPENDING ON THE SOURCES FROM WHICH OUR REPORTS ARE TAKEN. KABUL IS EVEN MORE THAN USUAL A HOTBED OF RUMOR, HALF-TRUTHS, AND HARDLY DISINTERESTED INFORMANTS. ACCESS TO FORMER SOURCES IS BEING STEADILY RESTRICTED OR MADE LESS USEFUL AS THE NEW REGIME MOVES TO REPLACE MANY INDIVIDUALS FORMERLY IN KEY POSITIONS, AND THE EXTRAORDINARILY CENTRALIZED NATURE OF DECISION-MAKING MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO RELY ON INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM MIDDLE OR UPPER LEVEL CONTACTS. IN THE MOSAIC WE CAN ONLY SEE CERTAIN PIECES, AND THEY REFLECT ONLY DIMLY THOSE WHICH ARE MISSING. NONETHELESS, WE WANT TO TRY TO ANALYZE THE REGIME'S PROSPECTS, REMEMDERING ALL THE CAVEATS IMPLIED ABOVE.</item>

                            <item>ONE ADDITIONAL CAUTION: ONE SHOULD NOT ACCEPT TOO READILY PREDICTIONS THAT DAUD WILL FAIL. THERE IS INEVITABLY A NEGATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT ON ALL FOREIGN OBSERVERS HERE PRODUCED BY THEIR BEING SLOWLY CUT OFF FROM OLD FRIENDS OR TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND WATCHING UNHAPPILY THE STEADY REIMPOSITION OF A POLICE STATE ATMOSPHERE LARGELY ABSENT DURING THE PAST DECADE WHILE DAUD WAS OUT OF POWER.</item>

                                    <item>AS WE HAVE REPORTED REPEATEDLY IN PAST WEEKS, DAUD IS NOT YET MASTER IN HIS OWN HOUSE, SITTING ASTRIDE A CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEAVILY WEIGHTED WITH YOUNG MILITARY OFFICERS WHO PLANNED AND <pb n="3" xml:id="d8-03" facs="d8-03"/>CARRIED OUT THE COUP. MOST SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS TRAINING IN THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> AND ARE UNDOUBTEDLY IMPRESSED WITH MANY OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE SOVIET REGIME. THEIR CONFLICT WITH DAUD LIKELY INVOLVES AT LEAST THREE ELEMENTS: FIRST, A PREDILECTION FOR RADICAL MARXIST SOLUTIONS VERSUS DAUD'S HIGHLY CENTRALIZED BUT CAUTIOUS, MORE TRADITIONAL AUTHORITARIANISM; SECOND, THE IMPATIENCE OF YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE SUDDENLY SAVORING ENORMOUS POLITICAL POWER FOR THE FIRST TIME, VERSUS DAUD'S LONG EXPERIENCE IN STATECRAFT AND THE AFGHAN TRADITION OF DEFERRING TO AGE AND SENIORITY IN LEADERS; AND THIRD, A REVOLUTIONARY URGE TO OVERTURN TRADITIONAL TRIBAL AND FAMILY AUTHORITY PATTERNS VERSUS THE CONTINUING STRENGTH THAT THOSE PATTERNS HOLD FOR MOST AFGHANS. THESE STRUGGLES ARE BEING FOUGHT OUT IN THE CONTEXT OF DECISIONS ABOUT MINISTERS AND KEY PERSONNEL BELOW THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL, AND HELP TO EXPLAIN THE SLOWNESS WITH WHICH THE NEW REGIME IS TAKING FORM. DAUD HAS APPARENTLY BEEN USING FABIAN TACTICS IN DEALING WITH HIS CENTRAL COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES, PERHAPS BIDING HIS TIME TO DEMONSTRATE THE INABILITY OF MANY NEW OFFICIALS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ASSIGNED FUNCTIONS BEFORE INSISTING ON THEIR REPLACEMENT.</item>

                                    <item>ON THE SECOND BATTLEGROUND DAUD, WITH THE PROBABLY ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT OF HIS YOUNGER COLLEAGUES, IS DETERMINED TO PURGE AS MANY TRACES AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT HE REGARDS AS THE ILL-CONCEIVED “DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT” OF THE PAST DECADE. HIS FIRST PRIORITY IS LOYALTY TO HIM, EFFFICIENCY AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE IS DESIRABLE BUT SECONDARY. “IRRESPONSIBLE OPPOSITION” WILL NO LONGER BE TOLERATED. THIS ELIMINATES ANY FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION CERTAINLY IN THE PRESS AND VERY LIKELY PRIVATE AS WELL FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE. A PURITANICAL REVULSION AT CORRUPTION SEEMS GENUINELY TO IMPEL BOTH DAUD AND HIS COLLEAGUES TOWARD ELIMINATION EVEN OF SOME OF DAUD'S OLD FRIENDS, AND OF COURSE TO CLOAK BASER MOTIVES. REVENGE FOR PAST INJURIES OR SLIGHTS, THE HIGHEST VALUE IN PUSHTUN CULTURE, INEVITABLY PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN ALL PERSONNEL DECISIONS. THE OPENNESS OF CONTACT BETWEEN WESTERN-EDUCATED AFGHANS AND FOREIGNERS, AN ORNAMENT OF THE PAST DECADE, WILL NO LONGER BE TOLERATED. THOSE STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT IN THIS PURGE WILL INEVITABLY CONVEY TO US MANY NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT THE REGIME “TO EXPLAIN” DECISIONS WHICH ARE PROBABLY TAKEN FOR QUESTIONS OF PERSONAL LOYALTY OR REVENGE RATHER THAN IDEOLOGY.</item>

                            <item>IN THIS MAZE OF PERSONAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CONFLICTS, PROGRESS IN BUILDING A STABLE REGIME MUST INEVITABLY BE SLOW, CONTRADICTORY, HALTING, AND FRUSTRATING FOR AFGHANS AND FOREIGNERS ALIKE. ITS PACE IS COMPLICATED BY THE INTRICATE WEB OF FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS WHICH ATTENUATE IDEOLOGICAL AND PERSONAL CONFLICTS IN THIS SOCIETY. MOST AFGHAN OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS WILL REQUIRE UP TO SIX MONTHS TO PLAY OUT BEFORE SOME SORT OF EQUILIBRIUM IS REACHED. PROBABLY BEFORE THAT TIME, HOWEVER, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHETHER DAUD HAS MASTERED HIS YOUNG COLLEAGUES, OR THEY HAVE MASTERED HIM.</item>

NO ONE WHO LIVED THROUGH THE PREVIOUS DAUD REGIME IN THE 1950S OR WHO KNOWS HIM PERSONALLY BELIEVES HE IS TEMPERAMENTALLY SUITED LONG TO PLAY A “GENERAL NAQUIB” ROLE TN THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY REGIME. HOWEVER, TEN YEARS ABSENCE FROM POWER HAS DEPRIVED DAUD OF A NUMBER OF OLDER COLLABORATORS ON WHOM HE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE RELIED AS ALLIES. THEY ARE EITHER DEAD OR INACTIVE, CONSEQUENTLY, HIS PERSONAL POWER BASE IS PROBABLY RELATIVELY SMALL. A MISSTEP IN HANDLING THE EXPLOSIVE PUSHTUNTSTAN ISSUE COULD WELL TRIGGER AN UPHEAVAL PREMATURE FOR HIS DESIGNS, AND THIS REALIZATION MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE GREATER CAUTION HE HAS BEEN SHOWING ON THIS QUESTION IN RECENT WEEKS. PREDICTION IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS, BUT MY PERSONAL ESTIMATE IS THAT THIS THIRD TYPE OF “COUP” IS THE MOST LIKELY OF THE THREE POSSIBILITIES.</item>

                            <item>THE SOVIET ROLE IN THESE EVENTS, BOTH PRE AND POST COUP, REMAINS MYSTERIOUS. THUS FAR WE HAVE NO RELIABLE SOURCES OF INTELLIGENCE ON WHICH TO DEPEND. LOGIC SIDES WITH THOSE WHO BELIEVE THE SOVIETS WERE AT MOST AWARE THAT SOMETHING WAS COMING AND HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY MOVED TO EXPLOIT THE RESULTS TO THE DEGREE POSSIBLE WITHOUT RISKING OVERT SIGNS OF INTERFERENCE. YET MANY HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND POLITICALLY SENSITIVE AFGHANS PROFESS “TO KNOW” OF A MUCH MORE INTIMATE SOVIET RELATIONSHIP TO THE PLOTTERS. UNDENIABLY THE RUSSIAN-ORIENTED COMMUNIST PARTY, PARCHAM, IS WIDELY REPRESENTED AMONG THOSE OFFICIALS NOW BEING APPOINTED TO KEY POSTITONS IN VARIOUS MINISTRIES AS WELL AS ON THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ITSELF. A NUMBER OF SOURCES CLAIM THAT THE COUP ITSELF WAS PARCHAM-INSTIGATED.(<gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">SEPTEL</gloss> WILL REPORT THIS ASPECT MORE FULLY.) WHATEVER THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WE BELIEVE DAUD IS VERY UNLIKELY TO PLAY DELIBERATELY INTO SOVIET HANDS, WHILE UNDOUBTEDLY READY TO MILK THE RUSSIANS FOR ALL POSSIBLE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR HIS OWN SCHEMES. WE ACCEPT AS PROBABLY TRUE HIS STATEMENTS THAT HE SINCERELY WANTS A CONTINUED US POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PRESENCE ALONG WITH THAT OF OTHER FOREIGN MISSIONS AND INTERNATTONAL AGENCIES TO BALANCE SOVIET INFLUENCE AND TO HELP MAINTAIN AFGHAN INDEPENDENCE. AND IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS MASSIVE ECONOMIC HELP FROM ALL SOURCES, BUT ON HIS OWN TERMS. BUT WE ARE NOW WITNESSING AND WILL WTTNESS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE <pb n="7" xml:id="d8-07" facs="d8-07"/>IN OVERT ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT AT VARIOUS OTHER LEVELS IN THE NEW REGIME. AND WE MUST ANTICIPATE AT LEAST SOME DEGREE OF PETTY HARASSMENT IN OUR DEALINGS WITH INDIVIDUAL OFFICIALS WHO, HAVING BEEN EXCLUDED FROM POWER FOR THE LAST DECADE, NOW OBTAIN KEY POSITIONS IN THE POLICE AND IN THE CIVILIAN MINISTRIES.</item>

THIS WOULD NOT FORECLOSE SOME YOUNG MAJOR TRYTNG TO SEIZE POWER ON HIS OWN; BUT WE BELIEVE THESE INITIAL TWO MONTHS HAVE HAD A SOBERING EFFECT ON YOUNG OFFICERS WHO ARE NOW EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES OF ACTUAL RULE.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>MOREOVER, DAUD IS INFINITELY MORE WILY AND POLITICALLY EXPERIENCED THAN HIS YOUNG ALLIES/OPPONENTS. THE ODDS ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN EVEN THAT DAUD WILL GRADUALLY CONSOLIDATE HIS PERSONAL CONTROL OVER THE REGIME. RECREATING IN LARGE MEASURE THE PRICKLY, INWARD-LOOKING, INDEPENDENT, HYPER-NATIONALISTIC, AND UNIQUELY AFGHAN TYPE OF POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HE LED IN THE LATE 1950S. BARRING A MORE ACTIVE SOVIET INTERVENTIONIST ROLE WHICH SEEMS TO US UNLIKELY, OR AN UNWISE DECISION BY <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> TO “TEACH DAUD A LESSON,” THIS SEEMS THE MOST PROBABLE PROSPECT FOR THE REGIME IN THE WEEKS AHEAD. TIME IS ON DAUD'S SIDE, NOT THE YOUNG OFFICERS. IF HE MANAGES TO STRETCH THE WEEKS INTO SIX MONTHS, HIS POSITION AS STRONGMAN SHOULD BE RELATIVELY SECURE.</item>

                        <p>Pakistan and Afghanistan continue to move slowly, steadily, and perhaps inexorably toward confrontation over the Pashtunistan issue. Each of the three players — Kabul, Islamabad, and the Pathan population of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province — is acting under strong domestic compulsions which are largely unrelated to the issue itself but which will continue to fuel rising tensions. Athough the situation is not yet critical, there are no signs that any side of the triangle is disposed to seek accommodation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Domestic Compulsions</hi>. In Kabul, President DAUD is locked in contests of strength with rival elements of his own government and with other centers of Afghan power. DAUD, a leading proponent of the thesis that Afghanistan is the political manifestation of the Pashtun people and that Afghanistan therefore has a legitimate interest in Pakistan's Pashtun areas, probably would not push his irredentist policies to confrontation with Pakistan on the basis of his convictions alone. Given his uncertain domestic position, however, the issue may become the only point of agreement between him and his own government and between the government and the Afghan people. DAUD already has locked himself into what is tantamount to an ultimatum to Pakistan over its actions in its <pb n="2" xml:id="d9-02" facs="d9-02"/>tribal provinces, and his domestic future may depend on his ability to maintain an aggressive posture.</p>
                        <p>Wali Khan, the political leader of Pakistan's Pathans and head of the opposition National Awami Party (NAP), has waged a long and unsuccessful struggle against the expansion of central government authority in Pakistan's tribal provinces. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s government, through maneuver and coercion, has systematically reduced Wali's power. Wali's statements over the past several months attest to Pathan frustrations; they also suggest he may have concluded that the invocation of the Pashtunistan issue is his only remaining hope to retain his position and that concern over a possible clash with Afghanistan over this issue may induce <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> to make new concessions—notably the restoration of governments in the two tribal provinces to NAP control.</p>
                        <p>For his part, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has demonstrated little tolerance for any form of opposition and, mindful of Bangladesh, is especially intolerant of opposition based an ethnic lines. The introduction of the Pashtunistan issue into Pakistan's domestic equation not only confirmed his suspicions of Pathan secessionism but also provided him the pretext to take repressive measures against his political opposition. In order to nip the issue in the bud both at home and in Kabul, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> feels that he must consistently react forcefully in response to NAP or Afghan statements on Pathan rights.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">International Repercussions</hi>. Since raising the Pashtunistan issue on the day of the coup, the DAUD Government has:
<list>
                                <item>- issued a series of public statements and private demarches alleging <pb n="3" xml:id="d9-03" facs="d9-03"/>Pakistani “provocations” which could lead to “serious consequences” and to which Afghanistan “cannot remain indifferent”:</item>
                                <item>- delivered a strong attack at the Algiers nonaligned conference on Pakistan's treatment of the Pathans;</item>
                                <item>- arrested and detained a body of Pakistan's Frontier Scouts which strayed across Afghanistan's borders.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>In response, Pakistan has:
<list>
                                <item>- announced that nomadic Afghan tribesmen, who normally winter in Pakistan, will not be permitted to enter without “travel documents,” which have never been issued to them before;</item>
                                <item>- reinforced its border with Afghanistan by deploying two fighter squadrons to Quetta, two infantry battalions to the Quetta border, and army units to replace border guards elsewhere; indeed, President Bhutto confirmed to Ambassador Helms that he was abandoning Pakistan's policy of rear deployment for the army;</item>
                                <item>- reactivated a dormant army roadbuilding project close to the border.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wali has contributed to tensions by implying publicly that he is moving toward secession and that he would seek outside assistance in a confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s reaction has been to arrest about 500 of Wali's NAP supporters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Status and Prospects</hi>. Kabul's “forward policy” has so far been implemented with words, but the rhetoric has been inflammatory and provocative. Pakistan's reaction, while short of belligerence, has been reinforced <pb n="4" xml:id="d9-04" facs="d9-04"/>with military moves. Both governments have assured us that they seek a peaceful solution and good relations, but neither has made moves to seek from, or to give to, the other assurances of peaceful intent. At present, Afghanistan and Pakistan are heading toward confrontation, and their domestic compulsions appear sufficiently strong to drive them farther down this road in the coming months.</p>

FINALLY, WE HOPE YOU WILL FIND WAYS TO INDICATE TO BHUTTO OUR VIEW THAT EXTENT TO WHICH HE CAN PRESS AHEAD WITH GENUINE POLITICAL ACCOMMODATION WITH OPPOSITION ELEMENTS IN FRONTIER WILL BE MORE DECISIVE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN REMOVING ANY BASIS FOR AFGHAN “MEDDLING”. NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN BHUTTO HIMSELF, BUT THAT NEED NOT PRECLUDE OUR INDICATING THAT WE FEEL THAT WAY TOO.</p>

                            <item>CONVERSATION WITH <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> ON AFGHAN-US RELATIONS</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>SUMMARY: LONG CONVERSATION WITH <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName>'S BROTHER <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> MARCH 20 PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEF HIM AND SOLICIT HIS ASSISTANCE ON A NUMBER OF BILATERAL PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY PEACE CORPS. MEETING DEVELOPED INTO A DIALOGUE ON OVERALL US-AFGHAN RELATIONSHIP, WITH <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> EXPRESSING HOPE US WOULD MAINTAIN STRONG INTEREST AND PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN AND WOULD CONCENTRATE ITS ASSISTANCE IN THE HELMAND VALLEY. HE ADMITTED THAT SOME “YOUNG LEFTISTS” IN THE REGIME TRY TO CAUSE TROUBLE BETWEEN US EVEN THOUGH THEIR ACTIONS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE SOVIETS SAY THEIR POLICY IS. CONVERSATION ALSO TOUCHED UP <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>'S FORTHCOMING VISITS TO IRAQ, LIBYA, EGYPT AND IRAN AND ON AFGHANISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN.</p>
                        <p>THE NEXT CONVERSATION OF THIS KIND FOR ME WILL BE WITH <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName> WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.</p>
                        <p>1. I MET ALONE FOR ONE AND A HALF HOURS MARCH 20 WITH PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName>'S BROTHER AND CHIEF ADVISER <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>. THE BACKGROUND TO THIS MEETING WAS A MEETING I HAD WITH DEPUTY FONMIN <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> ON MARCH 18. AT THAT MEETING I DESCRIBED IN DETAIL TO <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>PAGE 02 KABUL 01717 01 OF 02 201822Z</p>
                        <p>SOME OF THE RECENT PROBLEMS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING AND WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED SEPARATELY WITH RESPECT TO THE PEACE CORPS, THE AMERICAN FIELD SERVICE EXCHANGE PROGRAM, AND SPECIFIC QUESTIONS INVOLVING THE MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS. AFTER HEARING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND CLEARLY CONCERNED THAT THE GOA WAS GIVING ME THE WRONG SIGNALS, <persName corresp="p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> ARRANGED FOR ME TO SEE <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> BEGAN THE CONVERSATION BY SAYING THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT I HAD SOME PROBLEMS AND GRIEVANCES. HE THEN SPENT 15 OR 20 MINUTES REVIEWING THE HISTORY OF US-AFGHAN RELATIONS DURING THE TIME WHEN HE WAS FOREIGN MINISTER. IT WAS CLEAR FROM HIS DESCRIPTION OF THIS PERIOD THAT HE, AND NO DOUBT HIS BROTHER ALSO, CONTINUE TO HARBOR DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT OUR PAST SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN AND WHAT HE TERMED OUR LACK OF SUPPORT FOR AFGHANISTAN. AS FOR THE PRESENT, NAIM STATED THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE DOUBT AND SUSPICION IN AFGHANISTAN ABOUT THE DEGREE OF AMERICA'S INTEREST IN AND SUPPORT FOR AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID HE REALIZES AFGHANISTAN IS A SMALL COUNTRY MANY THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM THE US AND HE COULD UNDERSTAND WHY THE US MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED IN AFGHANISTAN. IF THE US IS NOT INTERESTED IN AFGHANISTAN, HE CONTINUED, HE SAID THAT WE SHOULD LET THAT BE KNOWN SO THAT AFGHANISTAN COULD DRAW ITS OWN CONCLUSIONS AND ACT ACCORDINGLY. NAIM ADDED THAT THE GOA IS ITSELF INTERESTED IN A STRONG AMERICAN PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE US CAN ASSIST AFGHANISTAN ECONOMICALLY BUT ALSO BECAUSE A STRONG US PRESENCE ASSISTS AFGHANISTAN POLITICALLY.</p>
                        <p>3. I BEGAN MY RESPONSE BY REPEATING TO <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> WHAT I HAD TOLD DAOUD LAST NOVEMBER, NAMELY THAT THE US HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN AFGHANISTAN'S INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY AND ALSO IN AFGHANISTAN'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. I SAID THIS HAD BEEN A CONSISTENT POLICY OF OURS OVER MANY YEARS AND CONTINUES TODAY. I ADDED THAT THE US ALSO ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO REGIONAL STABILITY AND THAT IN THIS CONNECTION WE WERE PLEASED WITH AFGHANISTAN'S POLICY OF IMPROVING ITS RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND IRAN.</p>
                        <p>4. I THEN REVIEWED FOR <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS OF MUTUAL COOPERATION THAT EXIST BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS. I MENTIONED THAT I HAD WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SIGNED THREE NEW AID AGREEMENTS WITH HIS GOVERNMENT. I SAID THAT BECAUSE OF NEW AID LEGISLATION OUR ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN WOULD IN</p>

                        <p>THE FUTURE CONCENTRATE MORE ON DIRECT AID TO THE PEOPLE IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH, AGRICULTURE AND EDUCATION AND LESS ON CAPITAL PROJECTS. WE WOULD EXPECT THE LATTER TO BE FINANCED LARGELY BY THE ADB AND THE IBRD TO WHICH WE WERE OF COURSE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS. I ALSO REVIEWED IN GENERAL TERMS OUR CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAM, STRESSING MY CONVICTION THAT TRAINING PEOPLE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> NODDED HIS AGREEMENT TO THIS LATTER POINT. I MENTIONED THAT WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING, WITH HIS GOVERNMENT'S AGREEMENT (HE NODDED AGAIN) OUR MILITARY TRAINING PROGRAM.</p>
                        <p>5. I THEN REVIEWED IN DETAIL THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE HAD WITH OUR PEACE CORPS PROGRAMS IN THE FIELD OF TUBERCULOSIS, AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND, MOST RECENTLY, ENGLISH TEACHING. I SAID THAT I HAD NO “GRIEVANCES” BUT THAT I SAW THREE ASPECTS OF THIS MATTER WHICH REQUIRE SOLUTIONS. THE FIRST IS THE FUTURE OF THE ENGLISH TEACHING VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE BEEN SUDDENLY REMOVED FROM ANY PRODUCTIVE JOBS IN AFGHANISTAN. SECONDLY, I SAID THAT WE NEEDED TO KNOW WHETHER IT WAS THE POLICY OF THE GOA NOT TO HAVE FOREIGN TECHNICIANS WORKING IN PROVINCIAL AREAS. IN THIS CONNECTION, I REFERRED NOT ONLY TO THE PEACE CORPS BUT TO THE RECENT DECISIONS OF THE GOA TO WITHDRAW AMERICAN MEDICAL TEAMS FROM THE HAZARAJAT AND JALALABAD. FINALLY, I SAID THAT WE NEEDED A DECISION AS E E E E E E E E</p>

                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> TOOK NOTES ON MY PRESENTATION AND SAID HE WOULD REPORT WHAT I HAD TOLD HIM TO HIS BROTHER. HE ASKED FOR DETAILS ON WHEN AND BY WHOM THE PEACE CORPS PROGRAMS HAD BEEN REQUESTED. HE THEN REPEATED WHAT HE HAD SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE GOA'S DESIRE FOR A STRONG AMERICAN PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN. HE ALSO SAID THAT AFGHANS AND AMERICANS SHOULD GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER. HE ADDED THAT THERE ARE, HOWEVER, PEOPLE, YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR, IN AFGHANISTAN WHO ARE IMBUED WITH LEFTIST IDEAS AND WHO IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THEMSELVES ATTEMPT TO STIR UP DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN AFGHANISTAN AND THE US. (COMMENT: THIS WAS ONE OF THE CLEAREST ADMISSIONS I HAVE HAD THAT DAOUD AND NAIM HAVE NOT YET BROUGHT THE YOUNG FIREBRANDS IN THEIR REGIME FULLY UNDER CONTROL.) HE SAID THAT THESE PEOPLE DO THIS EVEN THOUGH THE SOVIETS HAVE MADE CLEAR TO THE GOA THAT THEY WANT HARMONY AND STABILITY IN THIS REGION. NAIM SAID THAT HE HOPED I WOULD TAKE THE PROBLEM OF THESE PEOPLE INTO CONSIDERATION IN JUDGING THE ACTIONS OF THE GOA.</p>
                        <p>7. IN RESPONSE I TOLD <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> THAT MY APPROACH HAD BEEN AND WOULD CONTINUE TO BE NOT TO ACT ON A DECISION OF ANY INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE GOA WITHOUT MAKING CERTAIN THAT SUCH DECISION REFLECTED THE WISHES OF THE GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE.</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

                        <p>8. WITH RESPECT TO US ASSISTANCE, <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> ONCE AGAIN MADE A STRONG PLEA THAT WE CONCENTRATE ON THE HELMAND VALLEY, THAT WE SHOULD NOT “SCATTER OUR SHOTS” AND THAT IF WE WERE TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT SUCCESSFULLY, BOTH ON A BILATERAL BASIS AND THROUGH THE ADB AND THE IBRD, THIS WOULD NOT ONLY BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO AFGHANISTAN BUT WOULD ALSO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE COULD DO TO ENHANCE THE REPUTATION OF THE US IN AFGHANISTAN. I TOLD <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> OF THE CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE HELMAND WHICH <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> AND HAVA HAVE UNDERTAKEN AND THAT I WOULD BE VISITING THE HELMAND AGAIN MYSELF NEXT WEEK (MARCH 28-30).</p>
                        <p>9. CONCLUDING THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION, <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> ONCE AGAIN INQUIRED AS TO WHETHER THE US IS TRULY INTERESTED IN AFGHANISTAN. I REPEATED WHAT I HAD SAID EARLIER, ADDING THAT I COULD SAY IT AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES IF HE WISHED BUT HOPED OUR ACTIONS WOULD SPEAK LOUDER THAN OUR WORDS. THIS DREW ONE OF THE FEW SMILES FROM HIM IN AN OTHERWISE SERIOUS CONVERSATION.</p>
                        <p>10. AS I WAS LEAVING, I EXPRESSED MY HOPE THAT HE WOULD HAVE A SUCCESSFUL TRIP TO NORTH AFRICA. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD BE LEAVING MARCH 26 FOR IRAQ, LIBYA AND EGYPT, BUT THAT THE ALGERIANS ARE SO BUSY, PRESUMABLY WITH THE NON-ALIGNED CONFERENCE, THAT HE MIGHT NOT VISIT ALGERIA. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD BE VISITING IRAN IN EARLY MAY AND SPOKE OPTIMISTICALLY ABOUT AFGHANISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH IRAN. PICKING UP MY EARLIER REMARKS ABOUT REGIONAL STABILITY, NAIM SAID THAT HE WISHED AFGHANISTAN COULD ALSO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN BUT THAT HE FOUND THE GOP INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH. IN THIS CONNECTIONS HE SAID THAT AFGHANISTAN HAS NO DESIRE TO SEE PAKISTAN DISINTEGRATE.</p>
                        <p>11. I USED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEF <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> PER STATE 54992 ON THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION, FOR WHICH HE WAS GRATEFUL.</p>
                        <p>12. IN CONCLUSION, <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName> SAID THAT HE BELIEVES IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL FOR ME TO HAVE A SIMILAR CONVERSATION WITH <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName> AND THAT HE WOULD TRY TO ARRANGE FOR SUCH A CONVERSATION AFTER MY RETURN FROM THE HELMAND, PRESUMABLY THE WEEK OF APRIL 1.</p>

                            <item>We have carefully read cited FAA provisions as well as much of material related to hearings and committee reports. In country such as Afghanistan, which has culture and history so unlike that of West, there are severe definitional problems in attempting to relate Afghan performance to sense of Congress about personal freedom and development for people. It is our reading that Congress is concerned with host government's commitment to improving welfare, economic and social, of their people. And in Congress' view holding of “political prisoners” is taken as one indicator that government is not oriented toward its people as well as being an evil unto itself.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Our best judgment is that this government (relative to its predecessors) is generally above average in its commitment to reform and improve lot of its people. At same time, it is not an efficient government; it believes that certain actions are good for people which we might question; it is government with limited power to implement change it desires because of its shaky tenure in office, etc. Thus, although judgment is that intentions are relatively good, nine months since coup is too short to permit observation of much implementation of intentions. Current regime scores well (again relative to its predecessors) regarding intentions to serve its people. At same time there is not and never has been “due process” of law in western sense. Rule is of men more than of law.</item>

                            <item>Moreover, among politically active, allegiance to family and to clan may be more important than allegiance to nation. Political stability under these conditions necessarily cannot be maintained by appeals to loyalty to maintenance of system, since loyalty cannot be presumed to be present. Traditionally <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> hierarchy has believed it necessary to imprison certain powerful leaders for reasons of state security. Although in our way of looking, such state security prisoners are “political prisoners” in sense of Congress, from another view <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> is responding to what is probably a very real need to maintain degree of stability to enable it to implement any changes it desires. It is in light of this background that following specific response to reftel should be read.</item>

                            <item>Present government of Afghanistan seized power in relatively bloodless coup on July 17, 1973 and shortly thereafter abrogated the 1964 constitution. While that constitution did contain rights of freedom of thought and expression, right to speedy trial, and guarantees against torture and arbitrary arrest and detention, these principles were never established as traditions of this culture. It was not uncommon under monarchy for those too strident in their criticism of king or government to be arbitrarily imprisoned. Nor was it uncommon for persons accused of common crimes to remain in prison for years before trial despite constitutional guarantees. This is Afghan tradition. New constitution is under consideration, but we have no information concerning its ultimate contents.</item>

                            <item>New republican government left in effect those laws (unspecified) that “do not contravene republican regime and republican decrees.” Code of criminal procedures contains poorly implemented rudimentary due process mechanisms and consistent appellate procedures. It is generally rumored that decree embodying habeas corpus - an unfamiliar concept in Afghanistan - will soon be published aimed at solving court congestion and problem of prolonged imprisonment before trial. Government has been very sensitive to these problems and earlier sent teams from Ministries of Justice and Interior to provinces with the result that great numbers of prisoners long-awaiting trial have been released and number of pending cases have been resolved.</item>

                            <item>Reflecting need for stability, resolution published September 22, 1973, stated civil procedures do not apply to those government considers as “indulging in disturbing or disrupting internal or external security of Republic of Afghanistan.” Such persons “whether… military or civilian, shall be tried by military tribunal.” There are no appeal procedures. Whether such people are “political prisoners” as described in <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss> is question best prefaced by short review of GOA actions since it assumed power.</item>

                            <item>At time of coup a number of Afghans were arrested, or detained, the most prominent being former Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SMM2">Shafiq</persName>, Commander Central Corps ABDUL WALI, and his father [name illegible - Ebaj?] Wali, who are, we believe, still under detention. We have no reliable figures on total numbers of arrests, though we believe great majority have since been released.</item>

                            <item>In September 1973, government moved against alleged Maiwandwal counter-coup group. GOA announced that Maiwandwal committed suicide in prison. Other major figures were tried by military tribunal, a few were released, 15 to 20 given prison sentences, and five were executed. Minor figures - rumors put total number originally detained in the hundreds - were presumably freed.</item>

                            <item>In December, some mullahs (conservative religious figures) were arrested after anti-secular demonstration in Khanabad. Of 24 tried by military tribunal, 13 were sentenced and 11 exonerated.</item>

                            <item>As indicated above, major concern of present government is maintenance of its power. It has arrested and imprisoned those persons perceived as threats to regime's continued survival and tried them by military tribunal. GOA does not view such people as “political prisoners” but as “state security prisoners” whose special treatment is justified on grounds of national security; hence, there is no official policy on “political prisoners” as such.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>By western standards, however, such practices might be taken to constitute arbitrary imprisonment for political reasons. It is well to remember Afghan history and to realize that such treatment is not a departure from traditional Afghan practice and is consistent with a culture where disputes are often settled in blood; and where torture and taking of hostages is not uncommon.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>Given depth of such traditions, conservative nature of this culture, and sensitivity, bordering on paranoia, of government to internal or external threat, we do not believe there is any kind of U.S. action or representation that might significantly change the government's treatment of those it perceives as threats to national security. On the contrary, denial of economic assistance on basis of Section 32, would most probably be seen as an unwarranted attempt to meddle in the country's internal affairs and give credence to report, such as flourished at time of Maiwandwal group arrest, that United States is actively in league with those plotting overthrow of republican government. Consequently, we recommend that no action be taken by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> within this framework with regard to our assistance programs.</item>

                                <p>BEGIN TEXT: I STOPPED TODAY FOR FIVE HOURS IN KABUL, AFGHANISTAN ENROUTE FROM ISLAMABAD TO TEHRAN. THIS IS A FASCINATING COUNTRY AND A STALWART PEOPLE WHOSE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION HAS MADE THEM PROBABLY THE WORLD'S OLDEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL PRACTITIONERS OF NON-ALIGNMENT. AFGHAN HOSPITALITY IS ALSO LEGENDARY AND THAT WAS RICHLY EVIDENT TODAY IN THE WARMTH OF THEIR RECEPTION, INCLUDING A COMMAND PERFORMANCE OF BUZKDSHI, A TRIBAL SPORT OF INCREDIBLY ROUGH BUT ABLE HORSEMANSHIP THAT ITSELF SUGGESTS WHY THESE PEOPLE HAVE MANAGED SO WELL IN MAINTAINING THEIR INDEPENDENCE.</p>
                                <p>I FOUND PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName>, AN AUTHORITARIAN FELLOW WHO THREW OUT HIS ROYAL COUSIN A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO AND SET UP A REPUBLIC, STILL SENSITIVE THAT WE MIGHT SEE HIM AS A KIND OF RUSSIAN STOOGE. THAT THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE WAS THE FIRST POINT HE MADE TO ME IN OUR TALKS, THOUGH HE ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT HE WANTS AND BELIEVES HE HAS GOOD SECURE RELATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS. I MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE ATTACHED HIGH IMPORTANCE TO AFGHAN INDEPENDENCE AND THAT HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE DAOUD ANY DIFFERENT FROM HIS PREDECESSORS IN HIS DETERMINATION TO MAINTAIN HIS INDEPENDENCE.</p>

THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE AFGHANS, DESPITE THEIR INSISTENCE THAT THEY RESPECT PAKISTAN'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, NEVER ACCEPTED AS LEGALLY OR ETHNICALLY VALID THE BOUNDARY IMPOSED DURING THE BRITISH PERIOD AND INCORPORATING MINORITY ETHNIC GROUPS THAT THEY BELIEVE SHOULD BE PART OF AFGHANISTAN, OR AT LEAST SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT OPTION.</item>

When I was in Washington and had talks with Mr. INGERSOLL and other colleagues in the State Department, I was very pleased. I think now the US understands our views on international affairs better. Really, the only problem we have is Pakistan.</p>

                            </hi>: Because you are going to stay only for a short period of time, I'm going to only mention briefly the items of interest to us.</p>
                        <p>The first item is relations between Afghanistan and the United States. From the very beginning of our relations, it was the wish of the Afghani people always to have cordial relations with the American people and understanding and goodwill. This was not only a wish, but the geopolitical situation of Afghanistan always required that we have good and close understanding with the United States. Because of the politics prevailing in the region, sometimes a misunderstanding might have occurred in our relations, but it is always our wish to remove the misunderstandings and have really close and friendly relations with you. The remoteness of our country — we are not big and we are far away — may make it that Afghanistan falls outside the interest of the United States. But because of the geographic situation of Afghanistan, we always have been of the opinion that the presence of the United States was needed. So we hope the visit of the Secretary of State will promote this understanding, in accordance with both our wishes.</p>
                        <p>Afghanistan is a small developing country and it is quite natural for it to attract the assistance of the developed countries, and we always had the desire to attract the assistance of the United States, which is always welcomed and we value it very highly. As you know, sir, we have in Afghanistan with the assistance of the United States started a large project in the Hellmund. In spite of all assistance, it has not yet been brought to completion. We believe, without an enormous sum of money, it should be brought to fruition, and will not be a burden but a success. This project, related to the upper Hellmund Valley, should be a complex of electricity, irrigation and power. This project, at a time when the world faces an enormous food crisis, is for Afghanistan of fundamental importance. Because for Afghanistan every drop of water is life, and we need it for food. Essentially, we seek assistance for the development of this project. In spite of the fact that this is termed a long-term project, it was initiated 30 years ago; even as a long-term project, 30 years is a long time. It is our hope that for the completion of this within this coming ten years we will have the help of the United States.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi> (cont.): I wish now to inform the Secretary of Afghanistan foreign policy and in the region.</p>
                        <p>First I want to state the bright side of it [Laughter] — then I'll mention the difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Our relations in the region, with our western neighbor Iran, are extremely close and cordial. We've reached an understanding to cooperate very closely in various fields, and it is our hope and expectation that this friendship will be a factor for stability in this part of Asia.</p>
                        <p>Another country of great importance in the region is India. We have very close relations, and the closeness of views leads us to think we can expand this closeness and bring friendship closer.</p>
                        <p>With our northern neighbor, which is at the same time a great power, we have a very close relationship, and over the years, we have built friendly relations, so that we can say from that side we feel quite secure. Cooperation between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union has been very close; they have assisted us on many projects in Afghanistan, and over the years they have learned and we have learned that our close cooperation does not mean any ideological interference in our country.</p>
                        <p>Our other neighbor is China. With China we can say our relations are correct. The People's Republic of China has invited me for an official visit, and I hope within a month my visit will lead to a greater understanding.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: We don't speak of the past but of the future. In the last months, Pakistan brought accusations to Afghanistan which are absolutely false. One of the first accusations is they claim we are working for the disintegration and breakup of Pakistan. We are categorically rejecting this claim. We in no way expect or foresee or wish the disintegration of Pakistan, and we cannot do anything in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Because of the lack of time, I can't give the historical background, but one thing should be said plainly — the pressure being brought there on Pushtunistan and Baluchistan cannot leave Afghanistan indifferent. The power used by Pakistan against these people every day deteriorates the situation further. Pakistan, instead of seeking ways to solve this peace fully within its own Constitution, is using force to solve the problem. The sentiments of the Afghani people, because of the historical background, cannot remain indifferent about the situation. We should not forget these two regions were part and parcel of Afghanistan and were severed by colonialism from their motherland. This not withstanding, we don't have any territorial claims on Pakistan and we don't want the disintegration of that country. If on one hand the Government of Pakistan accords rights according to the Constitution to these people and with the other hand takes them away, we can't be indifferent.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was being very active in his peacekeeping role lately throughout the world, and also achieved successes. We hope his trip here will also be successful to help find an understanding between Afghanistan and Pakistan to find a solution to this problem.</p>

                            </hi> (Cont.): If Pakistan succeeds in bringing understanding between the various masses of people living in Pakistan, there is a greater scope of understanding and greater scope of cooperation between our two countries. This was briefly the situation between us and Pakistan, and we hope Pakistan can find its own people a solution, which will lead to the satisfaction of the sentiments of our people.</p>
                        <p>This was the bad side of our story. [Laughter] And you can see, to the extent that it belongs to us, it's not really very bad.</p>

                            </hi>: During all these years of this danger of war, your efforts really have been instrumental in bringing a better understanding among peoples and promoting detente. And we in Afghanistan praise your efforts. Small countries like us pray and hope your efforts in this will be crowned with success.</p>
                        <p>I am at your disposal if you want clarification of any point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I appreciate your presentation very much, and it gives me a very rapid and a very good insight into the thinking of Afghanistan. Let me make a few observations about our views, and I may ask a few questions about your relations with Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>First of all, the United States interest in Afghanistan is its independence and sovereignty. We have no interest in any dominant or exclusive or unique position. I say this to indicate we consider it absolutely natural that you have good relations with your northern neighbor. For that matter, we have good relations with your northern neighbor. For the leaders of Afghanistan this is all unavoidable and necessary policy.</p>
                        <p>We also understand why you would want some American presence here, and we are willing to cooperate with this. And I also agree my visit here can perform a useful role in this respect.</p>
                        <p>So the basic orientation of the policy of Afghanistan we understand.</p>
                        <p>We know if Afghanistan is part of a nonaligned grouping, the only point I have to make about this is that soon the nonaligned will become <pb n="7" xml:id="d15-07" facs="d15-07"/>the largest single bloc in the world. And those of us who are not part of it will soon begin agitating against the danger of bloc politics. [Laughter] And our only concern is it shouldn't be carried to the point where no matter what happens, bloc votes as a unit, because then it is almost impossible to conduct a constructive foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>But Afghanistan has not been particularly bothersome in this respect, and I say this to every nonaligned leader. So you can bear in mind that we don't welcome the nonaligned to vote against every American position. Although I say this isn't directed at Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">To return to the American presence: We are in principle prepared to maintain this.</p>
                        <p>On the particular project, let me say two things: I don't want to pretend I know about every project we have in Afghanistan or that has been put before us. I have some general knowledge about the Hellmund Valley project. I think the best way to deal with this is to send some senior official from our AID agency out here, to whom you can make specific requests. And our basic attitude is sympathetic. Within the next few weeks. And then you can develop together with our Ambassador and him some specific projects. We have some Congressional problems but our basic attitude is sympathetic. We will try to keep the bureaucracy to a minimum, but I can't promise anything, because we have many frustrated missionaries who can't resist reforming everyone. As far as we can do it from my office, we'll try to keep the paper work to a minimum. Ted, can you try?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName>
                            </hi>: I will try.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I have to tell the former Executive Secretary of the Department that I'm in awe of the system I found there. [Laughter]. The other day, someone wanted me to make a phone call to a Senator and sent me a memo which had been endorsed by eight different bureaus in the Department of State. Since my colleagues thought my intelligence has its limits, they called the Senator beforehand and told him what I was going to say. [Laughter]. When called attention to this, they removed the endorsements from the memo. But I'm sure they haven't changed the system [Laughter]. You might learn something in bureaucracy from us.</p>
                        <p>The other day I met a senator at dinner party who was getting nervous. Four different offices at the State Department had told him I was going to <pb n="8" xml:id="d15-08" facs="d15-08"/>call him, and I hadn't called him yet. So he wondered what he'd done wrong [Laughter]. In fact I had no intention to call him.</p>
                        <p>The reason I tell you is, when the paperwork gets excessive remember what I have to suffer. It's not directed against Afghanistan. Seriously, we want to be helpful to you within our means and in as helpful a way as possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: I'm very grateful for what you just said. If the bureaucracy is such a degree in advanced country, imagine it in a developing country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: You're hopeful, I imagine you do it on the basis of more personal decision.</p>
                        <p>I gave a lunch for the African Ambassadors at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and they had a spokesman for the Organization of African Unity, a very attractive girl, who was not selected for her brains. [Laughter]. My colleagues had drafted a toast for me, despite the fact I have never in my year as Secretary of State given a toast that was drafted for me. They gave it to her before they gave it to me. So she prepared an eloquent reply. Of course in my toast I said nothing that had been prepared. And since she didn't have a very quick mind, she read her toast, which was written several days before, praising me for things I never said. [ Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Now, with respect to foreign policy….</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: In connection with quicker decision, personal decision, I want to tell you that in a few short years we have embarked on planning for economic and social development, which we thought would lead in a few years to a democratic set-up. In spite of the fact that the Afghani way of life is a democratic way of life and our people are living their daily lives in a democratic set-up, our intelligentsia did not understand well — our responsible people did not react responsibly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Does Your Excellency speak English, so he gets a chance to think about his answer while it's being translated? [Laughter] It's an unfair advantage. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: [In English] I have a hearing defect and I can't understand so well.</p>
                        <p>The aim of the present Afghanistan Government, and the wish, is to re-establish democracy in a way that is appropriate and suitable for the Afghani people. We don't see a national life for people except that they <pb n="9" xml:id="d15-09" facs="d15-09"/>participate with the government and in the national life. Taking into consideration the knowledge and maturity of our people, we should be very careful in the future in drawing up our laws. For example, our friend Pakistan, which has established a so-called democratic constitution, saw fit to draw laws to curtail the right of the parties to function democratically. Because of that, Afghanistan has to be very careful. When a constitution is drawn up, it should be consistent with the understanding and maturity of the people. And this embryo would be expanded step by step in accordance with prevailing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>As you said, sir, present conditions may give the opportunity for people to take personal decisions, but we are not satisfied with the existence and prolongation of the present set-up.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: That is very interesting, and we'll be watching with great interest.</p>
                        <p>On your foreign policy points, I have already commented on your relations with your northern neighbor. And we think that is appropriate, and we have no concern. After all, you have some record in maintaining your independence. I don't think from my reading of Afghanistan's history that you've specialized in submission. And therefore we consider it a natural policy.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the People's Republic of China, as you know, we have good relations with both China and the Soviet Union. Incidentally, when you visit China you'll find they don't speak of your northern neighbor in the same friendly terms as you do. [Laughter] But that is their problem, and we don't get involved in that dispute.</p>
                        <p>We welcome if you improve your relations with the People's Republic of China, but, again, it's your affair. They were very concerned when your Chief of State came into office, because they expressed this to us. They thought you would conduct an extension of Soviet policy. The fact that they invited you must indicate their minds are somewhat at ease on this.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, that is true of Iran too. The Shah was in Washington when, or shortly after, it happened. There were questions on his mind.</p>
                        <p>With India, we really have no comment.</p>
                        <p>Now with respect to Pakistan. I'm not absolutely clear what you want from Pakistan. I think a territorial change is impossible, at least without war. <pb n="10" xml:id="d15-10" facs="d15-10"/>In terms of negotiations, if the United States can do something to be of some assistance, we'll be glad to consider it. We strongly favor a peaceful solution of the dispute. But I frankly am not absolutely sure what it is you want them to do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: From what I just mentioned a few minutes ago, I think the situation is quite clear. There is no territorial claim whatsoever. Afghanistan could never be considered an aggressor on Pakistan. We just want Pakistan not to create hatred among its own various peoples, not to use force against its own various peoples constituting Pakistan, and to keep its own house peaceful.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Do you want to negotiate this with them, or should they just do it unilaterally?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: We want the Pakistanis to not create hatred among its people, so not to see a repetition of 1971. If the process goes on, it is inevitable this would create the fact of adverse sentiments among the people.</p>
                        <p>It would create real emotion. Our people can't remain indifferent if force and pressure…. If pressure and force are used by Pakistan against the people, it would create an emotional reaction among our people to which the Afghanistan Government couldn't remain indifferent. The Pakistanis always accuse us of interfering in their internal affairs. But I can tell you here, we have never done it and have no intention to. But we have documents, proof, that twice they interfered in our internal affairs They are counterfeiting millions of Afghanis, our national currency, and distributing them here. This is immoral and inconsistent with international relations.</p>
                        <p>So I hope you will trust what we have said.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: If you can ever think of any specific thing we can do to be helpful, we'll be glad to consider it. We told the Pakistanis yesterday to exercise restraint. And of course any military or paramilitary actions across the border would be an element of tension in the area. We have a long tradition of friendship with Pakistan and therefore we would like to see its integrity maintained. But as His Excellency said, this is not the problem. As far as humane treatment of the population is concerned, we generally favor that.</p>
                        <p>So I think the best way to leave it is, if the Afghanistan side ever has a suggestion or idea they'd like us to take up, we would be glad to explore it.</p>

                            </hi>: We want Pakistan to provide equal opportunity for all its people and to secure equal rights in accordance with its own constitution. If they succeed in doing this, there will be no problem with us.</p>

                            </hi>: I didn't mean that. If Pakistan succeeds in solving this problem and secures the rights of Pushtunistan and Baluchistan within a reasonable and satisfactory manner, there will be no problems, and we can foresee good relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>

                            </hi>: Whatever the present Constitution of Pakistan says, which is not being implemented. It's a matter of its own constitution. If they did it, we would have no quarrel.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> THEN SAID THAT HIS FIRST REACTION TO THIS WAS NEWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN (<gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>) WOULD USE “UNLIMITED ARAB MONEY” THAT IT HAS AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE ARMS FROM U.S. HE SAID THAT AFGHAN SOURCES HAVE <pb n="2" xml:id="d17-02" facs="d17-02"/>DISCOVERED THAT COLONEL QADHAFI HAS JUST TOLD PRIMIN <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> THAT PAKISTAN WOULD HAVE AMPLE FUNDS TO BUY ARMS. I POINTED OUT TO MR <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> THAT THERE WAS NO NECESSARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR ANNOUNCEMENT ON LIFTING THE ARMS EMBARGO AND PAKISTAN'S REARMAMENT SINCE THERE WERE OTHER SOURCES OF MILITARY SUPPLY WHICH PAKISTAN COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

MR ABDUALLAH SAID THE SITUATION IS ALREADY BAD — NOTING THE REPORTED SPREAD OF UNREST TO THE SIND AND PUNJAB (<persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> NOTED TO ME SARCASTICALLY AT THIS POINT THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> HAD MORE POWER THAN IT REALIZED IF IT COULD FOMENT UNREST IN THE PUNJAB).

HE SAID IF WE WERE TO HEAR THAT SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN HAD REVIEWED THE ARREST CASES AND HAD RELEASED PERSONS UNJUSTLY ARRESTED (“SUCH AS WALI KHAN AND OTHER NAP FIGURES”) AND IF SAID <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> ASKED FOR BILATERAL TALKS, <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> WOULD WELCOME SUCH TALKS. <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> SAID <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> USED SHERPAO INCIDENT TO DESTROY CONCILIATION PROCESS WHICH HAD BEEN DUE FOR MAJOR STEP FORWARD ON FEBRUARY 15 WHEN AGA WAS DUE TO COME TO KABUL.</item>

                        <p>Date: September 6, 1975</p>
                        <p>Time: 10:30 a.m.</p>
                        <p>DISTRIBUTION: S- Mr. Adams, Mr. Bremer; <gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss>-Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RPW1">Rodman</persName>; S/S</p>
                        <p>[As the Secretary greeted the Deputy Foreign Minister, a large group of photographers entered and took pictures for a brief period.]</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What have you done to bring so many photographers in? Started a war? [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: I bring you the best wishes of President <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> and his brother Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have the warmest recollection of my stay in Kabul. I really did enjoy it very much.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: You are most welcome anytime. Your stay was very short but I hope you enjoyed the buzkashi.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I loved it, and I loved the spectacular scenery in Afghanistan. And I liked the people very much.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: Your visit created a very great impression. President <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> recall the talks they held with you very favorably. <pb n="2" xml:id="d18-02" facs="d18-02"/>I want to congratulate you on the important agreement that was signed in the Middle East after your long personal effort. We are very pleased that it resulted in agreement. It is a good sign and we hope future efforts will bring lasting peace in the area.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That is our intention. It is very nice of you to say it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: It is important for the world. If the Arabs don't get united, then there can be more difficulties.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: The Arabs have to understand what is possible and not ask for the impossible. Sadat understood this.</p>
                        <p>ABDULLAH: The view among some Arabs keeps them apart from each other.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That is a great mistake. It is playing into the hands of those who want a stalemate in the Middle East and who are against the U.S. playing a positive role there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: We were active at Lima in trying to prevent a move against Israeli membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That would be a disaster. We appreciate your help. I don't understand why North Korea was admitted as non-aligned and not South Korea. I could understand not admitting either one, but not the acceptance of one without the other.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: I was very tough on the issue at the first plenary. I said we must stick with the merits and philosophy of non-alignment. We should not let in those who don't fit the criteria. However, only Ghana supported me, but it was too late to affect the issue. What is the meaning of alignment and non-alignment if North Korea is considered non-aligned?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I am happy to note that there are not too many problems in our relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: Fortunately, no, there are not any. Your presence in Afghanistan is very important to us. President <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> told you that this is the view of the Government of Afghanistan. We are expecting more in the field of economic assistance.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d18-03" facs="d18-03"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Is the Helmand project going forward? It is? That's very good.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: We have established a kind of joint commission to plan and review U.S. projects. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BBWJ1">Brown</persName> are very helpful to us and have our confidence. Now, our relations with Pakistan are not normal. President <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> has explained this to you. We have discussed it with the Iranians and we explained it to the Chinese. I spent 45 minutes with Chou En-Lai.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Is he sick?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: Not politically.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: He doesn't look it. The place he is staying looks like a villa, not a hospital.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: Pakistan is not trying to help to improve relations.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have trouble grasping this issue. What do you want precisely?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: We are against the disintegration of Pakistan. We have no claim against their territory, although we could have. We talked to Iran and India, and they all want us to have good relations with Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I know some Indians who think Afghanistan belongs to India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: You have heard this from <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: No. From Indians.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: We are not attached to the Subcontinent. We don't consider ourselves part of South Asia. Pakistan has been intervening in our affairs. A group of terrorists affiliated with the Muslim brotherhood planned to strike against the government in Kabul and in five of our provinces. Fortunately they miscalculated and could not succeed. They planned to blow up the high tension lines but they failed. They confessed that they received training and help from the Pakistanis.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What do you want in Pushtunistan? Self-determination?</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d18-04" facs="d18-04"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: We want only legal rights for the Pushtuns and Baluchis, under the Pakistani constitution. We want Bhutto to treat them with love and affection.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Who treats anyone with love and affection in the Subcontinent? Love and affection are not really my style, at least not politically. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: Oh, yes. Look what you achieved in the Middle East settlement using love and affection. [Laughter] That is all we want from the Pakistanis. At the Islamic meeting in Jidda Aziz Ahmed kept avoiding me. I did finally talk to Agha Shahi. I said the same thing to him. I said, “Tell me when you are going to be politically mature enough to assess your situation realistically. Your country is shaky.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: When you speak of Pushtunistan, do you mean Peshawar?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: Peshawar, Gilgit, Chitral, the areas where the tribes live.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Yes, I know it. It is wildly romantic. Have I told you before what happened when I was there in 1962?</p>
                        <p>[Laughs] Yes. President <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> sent you away.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: If we want to help, what should we tell the Pakistanis? Love and affection?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: Yes. By the trial of WALI KHAN in the Supreme Court, the Pakistanis are trying to mix <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> and Afghanistan up with Wali Khan. The future implications of this are not realized in Pakistan. They are handling the case with emotionalism and sensationalism. Bhutto always acts on this basis without realizing the effect. We have told him that we are ready for any dialogue. But the political problem must be understood in Pakistan. There is an attachment of these people to the people of Afghanistan. The future of Pakistan depends on good relations with us.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Seriously, what could we do? Love and affection is a difficult concept to put across.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: Anything you want to propose. Use your good offices as the peace-seeking Secretary. Both we and the Pakistanis are <pb n="5" xml:id="d18-05" facs="d18-05"/>good friends with you. We are expecting good offices from you. We want this problem solved.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: If we can be helpful, we will be prepared to put forward any concrete ideas you may have.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: This is a concrete idea.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What if Bhutto says he is showing love and affection?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: He is not. There are refugees from Baluchistan in Afghanistan. We don't want to have to take care of refugees. If <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> does not solve his problem, there will be difficulties.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: There are two problems I would like to take up with you. The first is the outcome of the Special Session. We want to avoid a confrontational atmosphere. The speech which Ambassador Moynihan delivered for me was a serious attempt to make a positive contribution. We would like to see agreement on common principles at the Session and some agreement on policies. And we would like to see agreement to negotiate where we disagree. This kind of result from the Special Session will help those of us in America who want a constructive approach to these problems. Any influence you have to help us on this will be appreciated. Secondly, the Korean item will come up in two or three months in the General Assembly. We won't accept a vote which asks us to withdraw troops from South Korea, when those troops are there on the basis of a bilateral defense treaty. The United Nations does not look at other countries where troops arestationed under bilateral agreements, and we don't think the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should make a judgment in this case.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: We have relations with both Koreas. Our official view is to support the peaceful reunification of Korea.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We have no problem with that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>: The North Koreans have approached me on this. I say that we want to see a peaceful reunification of Korea. We abstained last year on both Korean resolutions.</p>
                        <p>[As <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">Abdullah</persName> took leave of the Secretary he said he thought the results of the Special Session may be favorable.]</p>

                            <item>IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE NEW AID PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN, BOTH WE AND THE MISSION RECOGNIZED THAT THE GREATLY INCREASED MAGNITUDE OF FUNDING REQUIRED BEYOND THE PILOT STAGE OF ALL OUR PHASED PROJECTS WOULD PROBABLY NECESSITATE A SHIFT FROM GRANT TO LOAN FINANCING. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PAST DISCUSSIONS WITH THE <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THIS EXPECTATION. ALTHOUGH THE <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> WOULD UNDERSTANDABLY WISH TO NEGOTIATE THE EASIEST POSSIBLE TERMS, THE NEED FOR THIS FINANCING TRANSITION SHOULD NOT CONSTITUTE FOR THEM AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE IN OUR POSITION NOR AN UNANTICIPATED HARDENING OF OUR CONDITIONS.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>AID'S LOAN TERMS ARE HIGHLY CONCESSIONAL AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO IMPOSE AN UNREASONABLE STRAIN ON THE AFGHAN ECONOMY OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOAN. AID LOAN TERMS FOR THE RURAL SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ARE NOT, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRACTICE OF MULTILATERAL AND MANY OTHER BILATERAL DONORS TO AFGHANISTAN FOR PROJECTS OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE, EVEN THOUGH IDA LOANS CARRY A SLIGHTLY LOWER (I.E. ¾ PERCENT) INTEREST.</item>

                            <item>AGENCY POLICY DOES INDEED AFFORD SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO GRANT VS LOAN FINANCING OF SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS BUT THE LATITUDE FOR EXERCISE OF THIS FLEXIBILITY IS LIMITED BY THE VERY REAL FUNDING CONSRAINTS UNDER WHICH WE MUST WORK. AS THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT INCREASE, THESE CONSTRAINTS OF NECESSITY BECOME AN INCREASINGLY DOMINANT FACTOR. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, LOAN FUNDING FOR THE AFGHAN SCHOOLS PROJECT IS NOT DISCRIMINATORY. I MIGHT POINT OUT, IN THIS REGARD, THAT WHILE AID DID GRANT FINANCE ITS INITIAL RELIEF/RECONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE TO BANGLADESH, THE BANGLADESH PROGRAM IS NOW PREPONDERANTLY LOAN-FINANCED WITH A GRANT COMPONENT (EXCLUSIVE OF CONTRACEPTIVES) SMALLER THAN THAT IN AFGHANISTAN. SIMILARLY, THE NEPAL PROGRAM IS SHIFTING TO LOAN FINANCING IN THE INDIAN RUPEES, WHICH PERMIT A HIGH DEGREE OF GRANT FINANCING, WILL NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE AFTER <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>77.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>REGARDING THE SIZE OF THE AFGHANISTAN PROGRAM, OUR CONGRESSIONAL PRESENTATION WILL SHOW ROUGHLY DOL 4.0 MIL. IN GRANTS FOR <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977 EXCLUSIVE OF OPERATING COSTS. THIS REMAINS ONE OF THE AGENCY'S LARGEST GRANT PROGRAMS IN BOTH RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE TERMS FOR A DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE COUNTRY. FROM THE <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> PERSPECTIVE, A REVIEW OF PROSPECTIVE PROJECTS FOR THE INTERIM QUARTER AND/OR <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977 (INCLUDING RURAL WORKS AND HELMAND DRAINAGE AS WELL AS RURAL SCHOOLS) INDICATES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN OVERALL <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977 PROGRAM LEVEL SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN FY-1976 AND FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE HISTORICAL TREND. THIS EVIDENCE WOULD NOT APPEAR TO GIVE MISLEADING POLITICAL SIGNALS TO THE AFGHANS REGARDING THE U.S. POSTURE TOWARDS AFGHANISTAN.</item>
                            <label>6.SPEAKING</label>
                            <item>MORE GENERALLY, I WOULD HOPE THAT RATHER THAN SEEKING A PREDETERMINED LEVEL, AID'S PROGRAM IN AFGHANISTAN CAN REMAIN RESPONSIVE TO THE AVAILABILITY AND REQUIREMENTS OF SOUNDLY CONCEIVED PROJECTS CONSISTENT, OF COURSE, WITH OVERALL AGENCY FUNDING CONSTRAINTS AND REALISTIC AFGHAN ABSORPTIVE CAPACITIES.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>IN LIGHT OF THE ABOVE, THERE APPEARS LITTLE PROSPECT OF GRANT FUNDING THE SCHOOLS PROJECT BEYOND THE INITIAL FIRST-PHASE GRANT ALREADY MADE UNDER PRESENT CONSTRAINTS. AID IS, HOWEVER, REVIEWING THESE CONSTRAINTS AS THEY IMPACT ON RLDC'S DURING THE CONING WEEKS, AND IF ANY CHANGES EMERGE FROM THAT REVIEW WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE RURAL SCHOOLS PROJECT, WE WILL OF COURSE BEAR IN MINDYOUR PREFERENCE FOR GRANT FINANCING.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>I HOPE THIS CLARIFICATION IS HELPFUL IN ALLAYING ANY CONCERNS THAT MAY HAVE ARISEN REGARDING AID'S CONTINUED SUPPORT OF AFGHANISTAN'S DEVELOPMENT.</item>

                        <p>1. ON THE EVE OF THE SECRETARY'S SEEING PRIME MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> IN NEW YORK, IT MAY BE USEFUL TO SUMMARIZE OUR VIEW OF RECENT TRENDS IN AFGHAN-SOVIET RELATIONS. TONE OF <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss> SEEMED TO INDICATE <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> IS UNDULY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP.</p>
                        <p>2. FAR FROM FALLING INCREASINGLY UNDER THE SWAY OF THE SOVIETS WE BELIEVE <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName> REGIME'S HISTORY DEMONSTRATES STEADY TREND AWAY FROM RELIANCE UPON SOVIETS AND TOWARD INCREASING FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF BOTH DOMESTIC ACTIONS AND FOREIGN RELATIONS. CABINET CHANGES OF SEPTEMBER 1975 (SEE KABUL 6429, 29 SEP 75) WERE MOST GRAPHIC DEMONSTRATION OF THIS TREND BUT OTHER EXAMPLES COULD BE CITED. INCREASING COOPERATION BETWEEN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAN IS ANOTHER CAUSE FOR BELIEVING AFGHANISTAN SEEKS AN INDEPENDENT COURSE AND TO FURTHER COUNTERBALANCE PREPONDERANCE OF SOVIETS HERE.</p>
                        <p>3. IT IS INTERESTING <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SHOULD HAVE CITED FEAR THAT AFGHANS WOULD SIGN AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>PAGE 02 KABUL 01418 250934Z</p>
                        <p>SOVIETS, FOR IT HAS BEEN PRECISELY AFGHANISTAN'S ARGUMENT WITH PAKISTAN WHICH HAS SERVED AS A MAJOR REASON FOR AFGHANS NOT SIGNING SUCH AGREEMENT. AFGHANS FEAR A COLLECTIVE SECURITY AGREEMENT WOULD FREEZE EXISTING BOUNDARIES AND THEREBY UNDERMINE AFGHAN POSITION ON PUSHTUNISTAN. FURTHER, ENDORSEMENT OF ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY PACT WOULD SOUR SINO-AFGHAN RELATIONS AT A TIME WHEN GOA IS USING GOOD RELATIONS WITH PRC AS ELEMENT IN STRATEGY TO OFFSET SOVIET INFLUENCE.</p>
                        <p>4. ISSUE OF FOMENTING DISSIDENCE ALONG ONE ANOTHER'S FRONTIER AREAS BY BOTH AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN IS COMPLICATED, AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS BOTH SIDES HAVE TRIED THEIR HANDS. OUR DISTINCT IMPRESSION HAS BEEN HOWEVER THAT <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName> HAS NOT FOLLOWED A “FORWARD POSITION” WITH REGARD TO INCITING DISSIDENCE SINCE HE RECEIVED A GOOD SCARE AT THE TIME OF THE PANJSHIR INSURGENCY IN JULY 1975. (SEE KABUL 4881 OF 7/28/75, KABUL 4965 OF 7/30/75 AND KABUL 5137 OF 8/7/75). WE ALSO THINK <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName> IS IN FULL CONTROL OF HIS MILITARY, THAT HIS NEW CHIEF OF STAFF HAIDER IS TOTALLY HIS MAN AND THAT THE AFGHAN ARMED FORCES WILL BE AS RESTRAINED VIS-À-VIS PAKISTAN AS <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName> WANTS THEM TO BE. HE IS CURRENTLY EXERCISING RESTRAINT.</p>
                        <p>5. FINALLY, WE BELIEVE <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName> LEARNED SOMETHING FROM HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE EARLY 1960'S WHEN THE PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE RESULTED IN A MAJOR BREAK WITH PAKISTAN, GREATLY INCREASED SOVIET INFLUENCE IN AFGHANISTAN AND <persName corresp="#p_DM6">DAOUD</persName>'S OUSTER FROM THE GOVERNMENT. HE WILL NOT, IN OUR VIEW, WANT TO PUSH MATTERS THAT FAR AGAIN, IN PART BECAUSE OF HIS SENSITIVITY TO IRANIANS REACTIONS, ALTHOUGH HE ALSO WON'T CHOP THE PUSHTUNISTAN ISSUE.</p>

                            <item>When Desk Officer Austrian and I saw Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">Abdullah</persName> on May 2, we hit him hard on the subject of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. We mentioned that his <gloss target="#t_UNFDAC1">UNFDAC</gloss> Director de Beus and his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> colleague Michael Davies during their recent visit to Nangarhar Province had noted a great increase in poppy cultivation in that area,compared to the same period 12 months ago. Austrian said that he had counted 106 poppy fields of varying sizes in the Kandhar-Lashkargah-Kajakai area (not, however, in U.S. project areas) earlier this week. We stressed that not only was Afghan poppy cultivation contributing to serious human problems wherever the opium was consumed but that the fact that poppy cultivation is not being controlled would sooner or later become public knowledge and would have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain our <pb n="2" xml:id="d21-02" facs="d21-02"/>economic assistance to Afghanistan. In this connection, Austrian cited various pieces of proposed legislation on this subject introduced in Congressional committees. We urged <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">Abdullah</persName> to do something about this problem quickly.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>In response, <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">Abdullah</persName> began by referring to the difficulty of convincing farmers to stop growing poppies unless they can make an equivalent income from other crops. We told him that in areas such as the Helmand Valley it should be possible to convince farmers that the Government is doing enough for them through economic development programs so that they need not grow poppies.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">Abdullah</persName> also said that one of the problems facing Afghanistan is the existence of criminal elements in the United States, Western Europe and Iran which traffic in opium. He urged us to crack down on these elements. He also pointed with pride at Afghan efforts in recent months to crack down on smuggling within Afghanistan.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">Abdullah</persName> said that he recognized the seriousness of this problem and would discuss it with the Ministers of Agriculture and Interior to see what could be done.</item>

                            <item>Summary. President <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> have overcome significant obstacles to achieve genuine personal rapport. Their June 1976 summit meetings in Kabul have resulted in setting up a continuing dialogue at in continuing the halt to the propaganda each country had directed against the other. Much can happen to derail this effort, and next steps may be slow in coming, but a start has been made. It has been demonstrated, at least in the short run, that opposition from the Afghan Left and the Pushtun “ethnics” to <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName>'s softening his line on Pushtunistan is manageable. <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName>'s gesture in inviting <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> makes it <pb n="2" xml:id="d22-02" facs="d22-02"/>unlikely the issue can ever be viewed in Afghanistan in quite the same way as in the past. Regional stability has been enhanced… a state of affairs the U.S. can applaud. End Summary.</item>

                            <item>One week after Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s departure from Kabul, talks we have had with a number of influential Afghans in and out of government convince us that the ice has been broken in Afghan-Pakistan relations. The <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> Summit, made possible by the statesmanship of both leaders, signals the beginning of a welcome warming trend in bilateral affairs, contributing to regional stability.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Two key concessions probably made the summit possible: the Paks were willing publicly to recognize that there is a “political difference” (the Pushtunistan issue) which has been a center-piece of Afghan foreign policy for generations; the Afghans (i.e., Daoud) were willing to have high level bilateral discussions without bringing up the subject of the fate of the Pushtun nationalist Wali Khan and his now banned National Awami Party (NAP) in Pakistan, which the Paks consider to be “internal matters”.</item>

<list>
                                    <item>First: The two men established what appears to be genuine personal rapport, overcoming pre-conceived negative impressions each had had of the other.</item>
                                    <item>Second: <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> has agreed to visit Pakistan to continue the bilateral dialogue. Such a trip was earlier literally unthinkable.</item>
                                    <item>Third: Both sides have agreed to halt hostile propaganda —- directed principally to the ethnic minorities in each country —- which had been for so long the scurrilous background for official relations.</item>
                                </list>
                            </item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>So a good beginning has been made and we regard this Afghan-Pak thaw, contributing as it does to regional stability, as definitely in the U.S. interest. There also may ensue economic opportunities for the U.S. should Pak-Afghan relations subsequently permit work on joint projects, for example the exploitation of the rich Hajikak iron deposits. Iranian interest in improving the Afghan/ Pak relationship has been and will be important to continuing positive results.</item>

                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>We believe the Russians and their local adherents are somewhat off balance after the Summit. We have reports of factional bickering in leftist circles over whether “abandonment of Pushtunistan” by Daoud constitutes “betrayal of the 1973 revolution”. The domestic left is off balance, and we think Soviet interests are off balance too, at least as they are perceived here by Soviet Embassy officials.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The thaw though begun, is hardly begun. Many things could occur to derail this promising beginning: a change of leaders; a terrorist incident; a personal misunderstanding between high level persons on either side. We intend to continue stressing the importance the U.S. attaches to continuation and broadening of bilateral diplomacy without outside interference.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>What happens next and when remains to be seen. Presumably the Afghans will appoint an Ambassador to Islamabad before <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> goes there. There are some reports that <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> will travel soon, but it is hard to see how this can be before late July at the earliest as he has Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> coming July 4-7, the Indonesian Foreign Minister on July 11, and his own national day celebrations July 17-19. We tend to think that concrete steps that ensue on both sides will take <pb n="5" xml:id="d22-05" facs="d22-05"/>place with minimal fanfare as befits the sober, serious, low-key atmosphere to date of this fragile rapprochement.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>One thing we believe certain: after being adamant all his life on the issue of Pushtunistan <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> has given a clear signal of change of heart. We believe it improbable this issue can ever again be viewed in Afghanistan in quite the same way.</item>

                        <p>June 29, 1976</p>
                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR: THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has proposed small PL-480 programs for Jamaica ($2.5 million) and Afghanistan ($2.6 million). The Secretary discusses the need for these programs in the memorandum to you at Tab A. At Tab B is a memorandum to you from Jim Lynn recommending against these programs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s memorandum points out the importance of these two small programs.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>— In Jamaica, we wish to extend a highly successful humanitarian program for an additional year to avoid giving radicals further anti-U. S. arguments during the current highly-agitated political campaign. Jamaica supplies over half of our bauxite needs, and investment disputes between the government and U.S. companies are in a delicate negotiating stage.</item>
                            <item>— In Afghanistan, we wish to remove the irritant of a program which was not completed in 1973 — albiet because the Afghans moved slowly. You will meet on July 1 with <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Mohammad Naim</persName>, brother and chief advisor to the Afghan President; he would be pleased to know this small problem had been resolved.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>OMB argues that these two programs illustrate an undesirable trend toward proliferation of PL-480 recipients. OMB believes these programs are of low political priority, have little developmental justification, and will be hard to terminate. Specifically, OMB argues:
<list>
                                <item>— that in the case of Jamaica, severe balance of payments problems should not obscure the country's wealth relative to other LDC's, and that the political impact would be both small and counter <pb n="2" xml:id="d23-02" facs="d23-02"/>to our suspension of development lending as a result of the ongoing investment disputes;</item>
                                <item>— that in the case of Afghanistan, the country has high foreign exchange reserves even though it is one of the poorest of countries, that our AID reduction is temporary, and that the program would probably have no impact on the country's stability. I strongly support Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s proposals for the following reasons:</item>
                                <item>— Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is not requesting additional funding for the programs, which would be included within the currently approved PL-480 budget. It is the Secretary's judgment that this allocation of available PL-480 resources represents the most effective programming in terms of our foreign policy objectives. I concur.</item>
                                <item>— Although OMB's arguments against “proliferation” of PL-480 programs raise a broader policy issue which could be prepared for your review and decision, neither paper adequately develops this broader issue. While it does not seem to me there is anything inherently wrong with small programs, I believe you should at this time review only the specific cases of Jamaica and Afghanistan, on the respective merits. (I should note that even with these two programs, the total would still be considerably below the average of the last 10 years.)</item>

                            <p>MEMORANDUM FOR: THE PRESIDENT</p>
                            <p>From: Henry A. Kissinger</p>
                            <p>Subject: PL 480 Program foe Jamaica and Afghanistan</p>
                            <p>The Jamaican and Afghanistan Governments have requested small Title I PL 480 programs this year. I consider it highly important that we provide such assistance.</p>
                            <p>OMB is sending you a memorandum recommending against both programs on the grounds, in its view, that they have relatively low political priority and little developmental justification. More generally, OMB is concerned that an increasing number of small programs will eventually force increases in PL 480 budget levels.</p>
                            <p>The Jamaica ($2.5 million) and Afghanistan ($2.6 million) programs fit within the approved Title I budget levels for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1976 and the transitional quarter. I believe the important issue is not proliferation, but whether the political, developmental and humanitarian returns are commensurate with outlay. I believe they are.</p>
                            <p>The Jamaicans attach symbolic importance to the continuation of a PL 480 program. Were it terminated during the current period of economic difficulties, the decision would almost certainly be interpreted as a “destabilizing” action on our part. Jamaica's leadership erroneously suspects that we are trying to undermine the Manley Government. An action on our part tending to reinforce that suspicion would strengthen the radical, pro-Cuban faction.</p>
                            <p>The US has significant economic interests in Jamaica. Among them is US investment in the bauxite/alumina industry which is about $630 million. Investment disputes between the Jamaican Government and the bauxite companies are in a delicate negotiating stage; the situation should not be exacerbated.</p>
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="d23-04" facs="d23-04"/>
                            <p>The Jamaican PL 480 program has high humanitarian content. It provides nutrition to a large number of Jamaica's poorest women and children who are seriously affected by the highly adverse trends in Jamaica's economy.</p>
                            <p>The Afghanistan program will provide about one-third of vegetable oil import requirements this year. Afghanistan is one of the world's poorest countries and is classed as one of the most seriously affected (MSA) by oil and other commodity price increases.</p>
                            <p>We have real, if limited, interests in Afghanistan. Internal developments there historically have affected neighboring nations, and our overriding interest in South Asian regional stability argues for a genuine United States effort to promote a responsible, economically progressive government in Kabul. Also, we seek to assist Afghanistan in avoiding over-dependence on the Soviet Union. The PL 480 program will contribute to these objectives and, this year, will help to make up for temporary reductions in AID programming.</p>
                            <p>In support of our interests we have invited <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Mohammad Naim</persName>, brother and chief advisor of the Afghan President, to visit Washington in late June. He is scheduled to meet with you July 1. I would hope that Afghanistan's PL 480 request will no longer be an issue at that time.</p>
                            <p>I urge your favorable consideration of both the Jamaica and Afghanistan proposals. I do not think there should be a presumption against small PL 480 programs; small countries are increasingly important to us. PL 480 has proven to be a particularly effective foreign policy instrument where the return can far outweigh the cost.</p>

                        <p>Date: June 30, 1976</p>
                        <p>Time: 4:00-5:00 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Place: The Secretary's Office</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It's good to see you again. I remember Kabul with the greatest warmth and the tremendous hospitality you gave us.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: We were happy to have you. Everyone who met you remembers you well.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: The scenery of Afghanistan is lovely.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: Afghanistan is a country without too much beauty, but it is a very interesting place.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have flown over Afghanistan and once visited the Khyber Pass on the Pakistani side. That was a long time ago. But I was impressed with the beauty of the country.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: I believe it is getting easier to pass between Pakistan and Afghanistan. We have entered a new period of trying to discuss our problems. President <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> of Afghanistan decided to take a step toward improving relations by inviting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> to Kabul.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d24-02" facs="d24-02"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That was very courageous and useful for the peace of the area.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: A friendly atmosphere has been created. We hope that a future meeting will provide an opportunity to deal with every problem and to eliminate the long-standing misunderstanding between us. We consider good relations with Pakistan to be very important. And on the other side, we are seeking to develop friendly and cooperative relations with Iran. All this will help to create stability in the region.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I agree with you completely. We thought the results of the meeting were very good.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: With respect to Afghanistan's particular situation, we are not without apprehension. This requires some explanation. There was a time in the recent history of world politics when emphasis was placed on the formation of military alliances. At that time, there were tensions with Pakistan. During that period, I was Ambassador to the U.S. In view of the tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, we thought that our defenses had to be improved. We presented a request to the State Department for very limited arms. This request was refused by the U.S.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What year was that?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: Late 1949 or early 1950.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You must remember that this building was then populated by people who in previous centuries would have been missionaries. They believed in goodwill.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: Afghanistan was cornered in a situation where the people expected the government to do something and the question of Afghanistan's security was widely discussed. A decision was finally made to seek help from whatever <pb n="3" xml:id="d24-03" facs="d24-03"/>source to ease the country's security problems. That is why Afghanistan began contacts with the soviet Union. The Soviets were prepared to give Afghanistan arms. This then led to economic cooperation which brought with it people and technicians from the Soviet Union. I remember well my first visit with the Soviet Ambassador in Kabul many years ago. I told him that we wanted to be good neighbors but that we have a different ideological outlook from that of the Soviet Union. l said that if the Soviet Union intended to have a continuing good relationship with Afghanistan aid and ideology must be separated. I was, of course, expressing views of only one Afghan. In the first few years they tried to control the ideological and political side of our relationship. The situation, however, changed afterwards. The former regime in Afghanistan brought about an anarchical situation with a new constitution. The Soviet Union then found it easy to forget what had been said before. After the recent revolution in Afghanistan nearly all the world, including Russia, mistook events in Afghanistan. When I first visited the Soviet Union after the revolution to tell them about it, I found BREZHNEV receiving me as though I were an emissary of a state which was establishing communism. This perception was not unique to the Russians but evident among others. This created more and more problems for us. The Soviets were more and more willing to see a situation develop along lines favorable to them. But, clearly, this perception was completely opposed to the outlook of the Afghan government and the Afghan way of life. We have, of course, received Russian arms. To man them properly, we have had to have officers and men trained in the Soviet Union. In the area of economic development, such as oil research, for example, we also had to send people to the Soviet Union for training. Now the Soviet Union is counting on these people who were trained there. As a result, we feel that the security situation <pb n="4" xml:id="d24-04" facs="d24-04"/>vis-à-vis our Soviet neighbor is becoming more and more undesirable. It is not easy to counteract the huge intelligence network they have in the area, as well as many other means they possess, including Afghans who are trained in the Soviet Union. We are interested in balancing the situation.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: In principle, I agree fully with what you have said. What should we do?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: We want American friendship and cooperation to be more apparent. It should be seen by everyone.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What can we do specifically?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: The U.S. could participate more actively in such fields as agriculture and education and in areas in which your technology is needed.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What is the obstacle?</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">ELIOT</persName>: These are the fields in which AID is concentrating, that is, agricultural and educational and health services. I don't quite know whether Mr. Naim is suggesting additional assistance in this field.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: By tradition, the U.S. has always been interested in providing assistance in fields of education and agriculture. We welcome any aspect of the American presence in Afghanistan. On. the other hand, we have to consider other things that might be done but approached in a very careful manner. Our intelligence is absolutely insufficient to counteract the Soviet presence.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Would you like some assistance in this field?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: Afghanistan would like assistance in this field.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d24-05" facs="d24-05"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It depends against whom the intelligence is directed. If it is against the Soviet Union we can be of help. If it is against Pakistan and Iran, we can't help.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: Intelligence against Pakistan and Iran is not the question. The security of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan is interlinked.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: In principle, we are willing to help. But concretely what would it require?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: We want to be more informed about the intentions of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Allow me to tell you from what we feel and see that the Soviet Union has no intention of applying in any way the process of détente toward Afghanistan. From their viewpoint, this process has absolutely no value in this connection. Whatever information can be given to Afghanistan with respect to the intentions of the Soviet Union toward Afghanistan would be of great help. This help, of course, should not be visible.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I agree fully that such assistance should not be visible.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: But, on the other hand, your open presence and your declared friendship will support a lot the idea of preserving Afghanistan from sinking into another ideological system.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We can do a thing or two. First, we can give you information through a chosen channel. Secondly, if you want help to train people for your internal security needs, we can be of assistance.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: During this visit I have had the possibility of meeting with different people to talk about <pb n="6" xml:id="d24-06" facs="d24-06"/>the subject of aid to developing countries such as Afghanistan. We would like to see America more dynamically engaged in our economic development.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What is the extent of our present program?</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">ELIOT</persName>: We have about 100 Americans in our technical assistance program in Afghanistan, and the program is worth $6-7 million.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: As I previously indicated, the tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan created a situation which led us to seek arms from the Soviet Union. Now we know that the consequences were not as simple as we thought.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Do you want to change your arms supply policy?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: For the moment that is quite impractical. What concerns us is the number of officers and civilian personnel who have been trained in the Soviet Union. When young men go to the Soviet Union for training they are inevitably influenced by Soviet ideology.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Do you want your people to be trained in other countries?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: We have asked India to train some of our officers but the possibilities there are limited. The same is also true with respect to Turkey. We will have to resolve this problem over the long run. Immediate action in the field of arms supply would not resolve the situation but create difficulties because of the suspicions of the Soviet Union. I hope that serious thought will be given to the overall situation of Afghanistan. There could be invisible intelligence cooperation and more visible evidence of friendship between Afghanistan and the U.S. This would create a sense of balance with respect to our security.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d24-07" facs="d24-07"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How do we do this? Invisible intelligence is easy.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: A more active participation in our development efforts will make the U.S. presence visible to all concerned.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What happened to the dam that we spoke about when we last met in Kabul?</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">ELIOT</persName>: We have started up a project in the Helmand River Valley. There is a team of 10-15 Americans working there.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: We have a long way to go in the field of development. Perhaps the most important problem is that of education in Afghanistan. If we can get assistance in the field of education we could develop young people less susceptible to a foreign ideology.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I agree in principle with what you have said, but what can we do concretely? I agree with your perception of the danger you face. Now the problem is what can we do?</p>
                        <p>HR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: A larger number of American experts to help us would be welcome. By doing that more possibilities are created of seeking and acquiring information indirectly.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: The U.S. is not interested itself in intelligence gathering in Afghanistan but we are willing to help do those things which would stabilize your government.</p>
                        <p>HR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: When you say there is no direct intelligence interest on the part of the U.S. in Afghanistan, the situation there should not be dissociated from the fact that developments in Afghanistan affect Afghanistan's neighbors and U.S. regional interests. It is not purely an Afghan internal matter.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d24-08" facs="d24-08"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I agree with you completely. I merely said that the intelligence we would acquire for ourselves is not of crucial importance to us but that the stability of Afghanistan is what is significant.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: The visible parts of our relationship we could discuss in detail between various agencies of our two governments.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: If you can survive until we reach firm conclusions in the U.S. Government, you are in no danger. We could send more senior Americans to Afghanistan. That will demonstrate U.S interest. We can study together how we can cooperate and perhaps Ambassador Eliot could do this in Kabul. We are also prepared to send somebody out if this is needed.</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">ELIOT</persName>: I have tried to respond as quickly as possible to requests made by the Afghan government. I have always felt, however, that we should let Afghanistan set the pace regarding requests for further cooperation.</p>
                        <p>MR <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: If you, Mr. Secretary, are in agreement in principle with what I have mentioned, our technical people in the departments concerned could study thepossibilities of cooperation and set limits.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I agree. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName> can represent the U.S. and, when needed, we can send additional people out to Kabul. You see to it on your side and I will on our side, although it is much more difficult for me than it is for you to get things done.</p>
                        <p>(TO <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">ELIOT</persName>) See to it that this matter does not get lost in an endless morass. Let them decide what they need and let me know.</p>
                        <p>(TO <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>) Will you initiate this matter when you go home?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: I am here for just that purpose.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d24-09" facs="d24-09"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Is Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> seeing the President?</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">ELIOT</persName>: Yes, at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I will be there. I will be there for the meeting because it would be dangerous to let Presidents operate under the illusion that they can make decisions on their own. This would create confusion in the government. If you mention this to the President, I will retire.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: Since I spoke to you about various facets of cooperation, I won't have to repeat myself to the President.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I will talk to him but it would be useful for you to repeat what you have told me. What you have said about history and your present concerns is very important. There will be no need to go into technical details. The President will turn that over to me anyway. Since you will have about a half hour with the President it would be helpful if you could summarize your points.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: To clarify what we have said, we want to create cooperation between the U. S. and Afghanistan in two ways. We would like invisible cooperation on intelligence matters. Secondly, we want very visible U.S. cooperation to give our pepole and others the strong imperssion that we have the U. S. as an active friend.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I'm sorry that we didn't have the Vice Presiden stop in Kabul in connection with his recent trip to Iran. I am going to Iran in August. Maybe I will stop in Afghanistan for a day.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: You will be very welcome.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Why don't I keep this in mind. We will do it the same way as before, that is, arrive in the morning and leave in the afternoon or evening. I will have to look at my schedule.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d24-10" facs="d24-10"/>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: I lunched today with a number of prominent Senators. Senator Percy told me that he had been in northern Afghanistan looking at a fertilizer complex built with Soviet assistance. It was not on schedule or finished at the time. Percy asked why the U.S. and the Soviet Union couldn't cooperate to complete the complex. The problem is that many people do not understand that such a project has many other facets of an invisible nature. It seems that our problem is not fully understood in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That is not true.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">NAIM</persName>: Afghanistan's security is important to the security of this region. If we sink, others will be in trouble. Increased cooperation between Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan will improve the general security in the area. Neither Pakistan nor Afghanistan have the ability to counteract Soviet intelligence in the region.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We will see you for lunch tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>MALIKYAR: We are having a reception-buffet for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> this evening and hope that you can attend.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It is not on my schedule. I will try but I am not very optimistic. We will see you tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: It has been a great opportunity for me.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I appreciate very much the talks we had yesterday.[to Scowcroft] I would like to see you for five minutes before the meeting with the President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Senator Percy</hi>: Mr. Secretary, there are two major problems which have over the years caused difficulties between Afghanistan and its immediate neighbors. One is the division of the Helmand River waters with Iran. This issue appears well on its way to being resolved amicably. The second concerns the problems with Pakistan in regardto the Pushtun People who live on both sides of the border. As you <pb n="2" xml:id="d25-02" facs="d25-02"/>know, Prime Minister Bhutto and President Daoud met recently in Kabul and apparently made tremendous progress in their discussions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: This is an impressive achievement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> told me about the talks with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. I think they made great progress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: There remains this internal question for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. We hope he will try to have a more balanced policy toward his people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Did you discuss this with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: [inaudible]</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: [to Scowcroft] We were talking yesterday about how we should have more visible activities in Afghanistan in the economic field. I have been talking to the Deputy Secretary about this. We told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> that we agree in principle. We are for greater cooperation, if we can get some projects developed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> is going to look into this when he returns to Afghanistan. Chuck is the expert in getting projects developed which others have to pay for. That is an in-house joke. We talked about some possibilities in the mining industry, especially steel production. Is Rogers here?</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">M.. Rockwell</hi>: No.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Senator Percy</hi>: You know we have a very visible airport project there. It was built to attract international flights between New Delhi and Tehran back in the days of prop aircraft, but was finished just as jets came into service. Now they all over fly Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Where is it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Senator Percy</hi>: Kandahar.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Was it unknown to AID that jet aircraft were being developed? This of course was before Dan Parker took over.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>
                            </hi>: The work was finished just as we entered the jet era.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Why would they ever have had to stop over in Afghanistan. Tehran is nearby.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Senator Percy</hi>: In the piston era they needed to refuel between New Delhi and Tehran.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Senator Percy</hi>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> had a good meeting with several important Senators, Mr. Secretary. Hubert Humphrey's eyes glistened when he heard how our new aid projects in Afghanistan are going. We are building schools in rural areas—and other projects—but only after the schools are constructed and in operation do we actually pay the Afghan Government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. parker</hi>: This is called fixed amount reimbursement. We are trying this in the Philippines and in Indonesia as well.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Can we do anything additional in Afghanistan? If not, we will need a new AID Director. Remember, Chuck, I told you once that I kept asking my lawyers a question and they kept giving me the same answer? You told me to get a new lawyer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. parker</hi>: Many of our programs in Afghanistan are just beginning to come to maturity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We are interested for many reasons to increase our activities in Afghanistan if the Government of Afghanistan can come up with projects.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ETLJ1">Eliot</persName>

                            <hi rend="underline">Senator Percy</hi>: My brother-in-law was stationed in Kabul as Peace Corps director. We went over to visit him for two weeks, traveled within Afghanistan, then went on to Hunza in Pakistan. That is how my interest in the two countries developed. I wanted to see if there was some way that tension could be reduced. I suggested a moratorium on hostile propaganda. A date was set, but then the date passed and nothing happened.</p>

But there was great progress indeed on this point in the recent talks in Kabul. Mr. Secretary, you should know that I asked my friend the Ambassador from Afghanistan if I could invite the Pakistani Ambassador to dinner with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName>. Mr. MALIKYAR said it would be a good idea. YAQUB KHAN later told me how very much impressed he was by the spirit with which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> greeted him.</p>

Bangladesh had observers there to check the water flow. Suddenly the observers were sent home. It is causing grave damage to areas of Bangladesh downstream. I checked into it to see if the World Bank has any leverage, but found that it was strictly an Indian project. There is no international leverage.

                            </hi>: It is kind of you, Mr. President. I appreciate this opportunity to meet with you and your associates. I have enjoyed meeting as well with the Congress and Senate. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our relations.</p>
                        <p>We feel we must have adequate means to prevent developments against our security. We need information which will help us to know what is going on. As I indicated to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, we need help in being more prepared for the future and for threats to our security. I was here as Ambassador when our military attaché prepared a modest list of armament that we needed. We wanted at least enough to give us some help and some indication that we could receive support if needed. It was refused.</p>
                        <p>When help was refused from the United States, we were completely defenseless and we contacted the Soviets for arms. They responded, and on this basis cooperation developed in other spheres of our country. <pb n="2" xml:id="d26-02" facs="d26-02"/>We have sent officers to the Soviet Union to their military institutions to train. Since the help was coming from them, they said they had to train our personnel. A number of our military people have not only been trained in arms but have received political indoctrination. Numerically they don't represent a significant percent, but they are mostly in jobs which are critical. We are in a posture of visible friendship with the Soviet Union, but we don't want to get too close. We don't feel any results from US-Soviet detente. In our country, we feel the antagonism has increased, not diminished.</p>
                        <p>If we could have an invisible cooperation on intelligence work and some help with our intelligence organizations, it would be of great help.</p>

                            </hi>: You have received a report from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. We need assistance in intelligence about what may be going on in Afghanistan. But we also want the presence of a friendly US in Afghanistan, cooperating in development, which will benefit my people and have a symbolic meaning. Most importantly it would be helpful in agriculture—our most important industry.</p>
                        <p>My people don't want to be gripped by a small percentage of people who are in the services of a foreign power.</p>

We need help in learning how to make our dried fruit more marketable in the U.S. I discussed with Mr. McNamara the production of steel. We are in the process of creating a network of railroads which will let us export iron ore and help us in our own consumption. Mr. McNamara promised to send people to study the projects. We thought maybe the U.S. and other developed countries could join to help us develop in these areas.</p>

                            </hi>: I am extremely grateful, Mr. President, and I recall our last talks with much pleasure. And we were happy to receive Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> in Washington.</p>

                            </hi>: I thank you, sir, and I wish to thank you also for the warm welcome extended to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Mohammad Naim</persName> in Washington and by all the people in the United States.</p>

                            </hi>: We attach great importance to our relationship with Afghanistan and your independence and territorial integrity.</p>

                            </hi>: Thank you, sir. Knowing your stay is a very short one with us, I will confine myself to just necessary remarks. I will just mention the situation. I am sure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Mohammad Naim</persName> in meeting with you in Washington had an opportunity to explain our relations with the countries of the region and our policies internally and externally.</p>
                        <p>I had an opportunity on your previous visit to Kabul to explain the purpose of the revolution in Afghanistan, why it came into being. I also had the opportunity to explain our nonaligned policy and our relationship in the region. So I need not go into this at great length again, since I had the opportunity to explain it to you.</p>
                        <p>Since our previous meeting, no big changes have occurred, but there were some few significant changes in the region that have in fact occurred, and I would like to explain them briefly. One of these important developments is the changes that have occurred in our relations with Pakistan and in relations between India and Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>With respect to our relations, I am sure your Excellency will remember that during that time natural calamities struck Afghanistan—floods, earthquakes. The Pakistanis, because of these calamities, made very humanitarian gestures toward us and extended assistance to us. This offer of assistance to us in those days was of course quite natural and these were human gestures, but what happened next was very important to us and was a substantial move. Pakistan stopped all hostile propaganda and gestures to us. We interpreted this gesture as a gesture of good-will, and accordingly we availed ourselves to the opportunity to move ahead and therefore we invited Prime Minister Bhutto to visit Afghanistan and he very kindly accepted.</p>
                        <p>I can tell you as a friend of Afghanistan and also as a friend of Pakistan that our meetings took place in a very friendly atmosphere. We obtained the views of each other and succeeded in breaking the ice. We believe if these discussions and these contacts continue, we will be able to solve these political differences with respect to Pushtoonistan, and relations will continue to improve.</p>

                            </hi>: How will you solve the problem?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName>
                            </hi>: We will solve this question honorably and realistically. We are hopeful the Pakistanis will agree to extend the same rights to the Pushtoon and Baluchi people that they extend to their other peoples, rights already enshrined in the constitution of Pakistan. This of course is conditioned to acceptance by the Pushtoon and Baluchi people. We are most hopeful that if the Government of Pakistan adopts a friendly attitude towards them, this will be solved to the satisfaction of the Pushtoon and Baluchi people. It is premature for me to say the end results of our discussion and contacts, but I am hopeful that if this atmosphere continues, we can solve it honorably.</p>

                            </hi>: I understand the President is visiting Pakistan after the nonaligned conference.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, we have decided so. On my return from the Colombo Conference, I shall stop over for three or four days, maybe, in Pakistan. We will continue the talks we started in Kabul and we will see where this will lead us in Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>We have said this to the Pakistanis not as a condition but as a friendly suggestion—and we will say this to you as a friend of Pakistan—that if a favorable gesture is made by the Government of Pakistan to the Pushtoon and Baluchi people, this will create a much better atmosphere.</p>

                            </hi>: I want first of all to explain to you that it is very difficult for me to go to Pakistan. Because the NAP people are presently in prison and the government has accused Afghanistan of conniving with these people to break up Pakistan. So Afghanistan stands accused. So it is difficult for me to go while the NAP people, who in our view are freedom fighters, are in prison.</p>

                            </hi>: As you know, this problem between us and Pakistan is extremely complicated and I think you cannot solve it at one or two meetings. Of course, if it was solved in one or two meetings, it would give us a great satisfaction. This will depend on the understanding of both sides. In any case, we are going there, and we are hopeful that if the problem is not solved, we will have at least taken a step forward.</p>

                        <p>The other point I want to touch upon is relations between Afghanistan and your country.

                            </hi>: I want to add that in this region of ours, there are a variety of interests and ideologies in conflict with each other, and when they come in contact there are always difficulties. Therefore, I think the means in your possession are much bigger and more perfect than what small countries possess.</p>

                            </hi>: Since it is better to discuss this while I am here, rather than through cables, what particular dangers are you most concernedabout — foreign invasion or intervention?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: I don't believe aggression from abroad is something that will materialize. We don't have any fear about that. But subversion internally is something that concerns us. We have good relations with our neighbors and presently we don't fear any aggression from them. But in our policies, domestic and in general, we follow a line that is characteristic of our way of life and special to us. It is an Afghan line, in keeping with our people and our traditions. Therefore this kind of attitude — an independent attitude and independent line — may not be to the likingof the Left or to the liking of the Right. Therefore we are prone to any kind of influence, our people, and during the past ten years the situation was such that our country was open to all kinds of influence and all kinds of ideas. Therefore we would be very happy and would appreciate it very much if our American friends, with the worldwide means they have at their disposal, if they feel or see a threat to our security, could inform us as soon as possible.</p>

                            </hi>: Today our Minister of Planning will explain in detail how we view assistance from the United States. But I will mention, for example, the central Helmand Valley, the Kajakai drainage system that goes with it, electric generators. All this has been started by the United States and we want this to be effectively achieved by you. The electric power extension of Kandahar, Lashkargah, Girishk, and the extension of the line between Kandahar and Kabul.</p>
                        <p>In the field of education, we have a faculty of engineering in mind and would like to see the expansion of it, and an increase in the number of experts. This has been already started by the US and we would like it strengthened.</p>

                            </hi>: At the same time, strengthening of the faculty of agriculture. We also are in dire need of management, and if the United States could assist us in setting up a managerial institution, this also would be very much appreciated.</p>
                        <p>Also for rural development, we wish your assistance. And if an institution could be created for rural development.</p>
                        <p>In the field of agriculture, we would also like fertilizer, phosphates-diamonds and phosphate. If the United States could furnish around 150,000 tons of this, we would appreciate it very much.</p>
                        <p>In the field of health, if at all possible for you to assist us in building a big hospital of 450-500 beds.</p>
                        <p>And also living quarters for our faculty for girls. A dormitory for girls in the University of Kabul.</p>

                        <p>I wonder if the President noticed that not one Republican has been involved in a scandal with girls. I'm getting worried.[Laughter] We need at least one sex scandal. [Laughter]</p>

                        <p>May I ask you, if I may, about your relations with India?</p>

                            </hi>: Our relations with India are friendly and aloof. It's a fortunate thing the Indians are pacifists; otherwise their neighbors would be worried [Laughter] But we… The first time we were in India, they told me that Kabul belonged to India too. [Laughter] I think it's correct to say Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> does not have a personality that appeals at first blush to Americans. Maybe not even at second blush. [Laughter] There have even been cases of people who have resisted her a third time. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>But we have no particular national quarrel with India. We feel that whenever they get into domestic difficulties, they start kicking us around, that is great fun — until we react to it. So we have no particular outstanding quarrel. But you could also not speak of an intimate friendship. And we would not be amused if India started to bring pressure — military pressure —on its neighbors. On the other hand, we are encouraging both India and Pakistan to settle their difficulties peacefully. I think some progress has been made.</p>

                            </hi>: It is not clear to me by what definition Cuba is a nonaligned country. Otherwise we'd be tempted to ask for at least observer status ourselves. (Laughter)</p>
                        <p>The President belongs to the biggest group that exists. It is we aligned who have no friends anymore. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>We have three problems that are of particular interest to the United States.</p>
                        <p>First is Puerto Rico. This is to us an internal affair which is not subject to international debate. And we would have… we would be bound to consider it unfriendly if at the General Assembly something happened with respect to Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>We have had two referendums in Puerto Rico in which they chose their present status. I have to tell you if the General Assembly votes anything on Puerto Rico, we will participate in no further meeting of the General Assembly at that meeting, on any subject. I say this only to indicate this is a matter of principle</p>
                        <p>The second issue is Korea. We are not asking friendly countries so much to vote for our ideas; we think the best solution is to not have any debate on the subject this year. If there is a debate, we would hope there is an even-handed outcome.</p>
                        <p>The third is the issue of the Middle East. We hope the United Nations and the Nonaligned Conference won't do anything to complicate the situation.</p>
                        <p>But you will be with a large group of nations in Sri Lanka, whose leaders are not exactly weak personalities. So it will be a merry session.</p>

Everyone thinks I'm going to write a biography when I leave my job. In 1981. But I'm going to use my knowledge to get people to pay me not to write a book. [Laughter] It'll be about the bureaucracy of the State Department. My colleagues are of the conviction the only way I could get into the State Department was as Secretary of State; I don't have the qualifications to be a Foreign service Officer. This affects their attitude towards me. The whole machinery of the Department is to prevent the Secretary from making any meaningful decisions. [Laughter]</p>

                        <p>We discussed in Washington the construction of a new engineering faculty [of Kabul University] based on our present requirements, and also strengthening our engineering faculty.</p>
                        <p>Also the strengthening of our agricultural faculty.</p>
                        <p>The establishment of a training institute and a rural development program.</p>
                        <p>And also we discussed questions of the agricultural sector — the transmission line between Kajakai to Kabul, and strengthening of the Kajakai power from 32 megawatts to 150 megawatts.</p>
                        <p>And extension of power capacity in Girishk and Kandahar.</p>
                        <p>I have this letter I received from Mr. Parker. [He hands to Secretary Kissinger an excerpt from an AID cable. The Secretary reads it. He shows it to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>.]</p>

                        <p>I agree with this approach for the future but not for now. For future long-term planning.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Khurram</hi>: This is an unfinished symphony. It was started with the help of the United states. When John Hannah came, we took a trip to the Helmand Valley. We were spending $50 million on the Khandahar project and we needed only $4 million more to finish the power line. Which has since increased to $8 million. I thought the United States should finish it and get the credit; why have someone else come in and do it? The location for the third turbine is already there. All the rest has been done. We won't spend more than $6 million. But to go from 32 megawatts to 150 megawatts would make us a big difference. We request the United States to help us finish.</p>
                        <p>When I was a student in the United States, there was a saying: The tail of an elephant always goes with the head.</p>
                        <p>Then there are new projects we had in mind, counting on the assistance of our friends:</p>
                        <p>A 500-bed hospital, My friend, the Minister of Public Health, will explain this. We are already getting help for rural health. But to maintain a balance between the minor projects and visible projects, so people see it was done by the United States, we want to do this. It will benefit the poor.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> mentioned we needed some training center for short-run training of these intermediate personnel.</p>

We are going to construct a steel plant here, with the good raw material which we have — a proven reserve of 2 billion tons of iron ore; its iron content is .64, which is among the highest in the world, but we can't use it. So, with the railway line and existing iron ore, we would like to build a steel plant. We'd like your assistance either directly or with your support in the World Bank.</p>

                        <p>Our USIS Library in Dacca remains in the control of radical student demonstrators who occupied it following police withdrawal on January 2. The Library has been “renamed” in memory of two students killed in an earlier attack and the flags of North Vietnam and the VC fly overhead.</p>
                        <p>To our knowledge Bangladesh authorities are doing nothing to restore the situation and the Government appears frozen by fear of confrontation with the students. Foreign Office officials have indicated their fear that nothing can be done prior to parliamentary elections in March.</p>
                        <p>This is intolerable. Clearly there is going to be no prompt action unless Mujib himself acts. We have therefore prepared the attached message from you to the Prime Minister emphasizing our concern and indicating our expectation that prompt steps will be taken peacefully to restore the Library to us.</p>
                        <p>You should also know that the Ambassador-designate from Bangladesh plans to depart Dacca shortly for arrival here. We question whether you or the President would want to receive him with circumstances unchanged in Dacca. If no action has been taken as a result of your message by early next week, we think we should consider informing Dacca that his arrival at present would be inappropriate.</p>

                            <item>AID for Bangladesh</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>State and AID have proposed going ahead now with a $30 million rehabilitation grant for Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>There are no budgetary or economic problems with this grant. The money is already in our budget and set aside for Bangladesh this year. It would bring our total bilateral grant assistance to Bangladesh since independence up to $145 million and would go mainly for procurement of fertilizer and cotton essential to agricultural and industrial recovery and for rural rehabilitation. These are critical areas and there is no question about the need.</p>
                        <p>There is an issue over the precise timing of this new authorization. The original idea had been to wait until after the March elections so that we could press for greater government identification with US aid. Now, however, two arguments have arisen for moving sooner:
<list>
                                <item>--Our embassy in Dacca feels there is advantage in capitalizing on the fact that the government, after a weak start, has stood up to the tendency to use anti-Americanism as a weapon in the election campaign. You will recall that our USIS building in Dacca was occupied with apparent government acquiescence in December, but since then they have taken an increasingly firm stand against anti-US activity.</item>
                                <item>--The AID mission recommends going ahead now since the fertilizers to be bought under the loan are needed quickly to improve the next crop and somewhat reduce the burden on us for later food aid.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The main reason for bringing this to you is that the Bengalis, including Mujib, lashed out at us with sharp statements when the bombing of North Vietnam was renewed. Mujib did, however, send a warm congratulatory message to the President when the cease-fire agreement was signed.</p>

THE SIMLA AGREEMENT WAS A RATHER REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT TO EMERGE SO SOON AFTER THE END OF A BITTER WAR. HE THOUGHT THAT THE NATIONS IN SOUTH ASIA NOW WERE ALL MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND IN A DIRECTION WHICH WAS IN THEIR MUTUAL INTEREST.

                            <item>ALI POINTED OUT THAT TIMING WAS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. PAKISTAN HAD STILL NOT BROUGHT ITSELF TO RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF BANGLADESH. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> WAS ALSO ARGUING THAT WAR CRIMES TRIALS WOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF RECONCILIATION.

CLEARLY THERE WERE EXCESSES DURING THE PERIOD. NO ONE DENIED THIS; <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HIMSELF HAD ADMITTED AS MUCH. MUJIB FELT HE COULD NOT JUST WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN; BUT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> WAS ALSO IN A DIFFICULT POSITION. HE HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF CUSHIONING THE LOSS OF THE EAST. HE HAS BEEN PREPARING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE EVOLUTION OF A POSITIVE NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. THIS WAS A DELICATE PROCESS AND ONE WHICH REQUIRED TIME. THE PROBLEM WAS HOW TO PROCEED WITH THIS EFFORT WITH THE PROSPECT OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS STIRRING UP EMOTIONS ON BOTH SIDES.

                        <p>The government of <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</persName> is losing the confidence of the people as economic problems continue to go unsolved and the expectations of a newly-independent people are unrealized.</p>
                        <p>Availability of food, especially rice, at stable prices is essential to the preservation of the authority of the BDG and of law and order in the major urban areas of Dacca and Chittagong. Should government stocks be exhausted, civil unrest is expected to follow, with unpredictable consequences for the present <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss>, and for stability in South Asia.</p>
                        <p>Bangladesh needs an estimated 2.5 million tons of food-grain imports in calendar year 1973 in order to maintain subsistence levels for its population. Against this need the <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> has purchased some 1.1 million tons on world markets, has pledges from countries other than the U.S. for almost 700,000 tons, and has a pledge from the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for the remaining 700,000 tons, 200,000 tons of which were shipped early in the year.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> intends to finance the remainder of its pledge through the use of bilateral grant funds for 200,000 tons, and under PL-480, Title I for 300,000 tons. All of it should he made available for distribution during the period of the greatest scarcity immediately preceding the main annual rice harvest in late November and December. In order to meet this schedule shipments must be completed from U.S. ports during the first quarter of FY-1974 (i.e. not later than September 1973).</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d32-02" facs="d32-02"/>
                        <p>Because of the unusually tight U.S. grain position, USDA has not been able to set an allocation for foodgrains to be made available worldwide under congressional financing in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1974, nor even for the first quarter of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1974. No decision is expected until July 6, making it virtually impossible to meet the Bangladesh requirement on a timely basis. Furthermore, the allocation levels presently being discussed for the first quarter of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1974 are too low to permit Bangladesh to get more than 300,000 tons.</p>
                        <p>In order to meet our commitment, shipments of wheat must leave U.S. ports for Bangladesh early in July. It is recommended that an exception be made permitting shipment of at least 100,000 tons of wheat in advance of decisions scheduled for July 6 on the overall scale of the Title I program.</p>

                        <p>Washington</p>
                        <p>Dear <persName>Peter</persName>:</p>
                        <p>This letter is about U.S. military supply policy toward Bangladesh. It is stimulated by your letter of August 13. Since your letter, I have discussed the subject in varying detail with all elements of the country team. The following commentary reflects a consensus, but I have not attempted to elaborate a formally cleared country team document. Not all members of the country team, after all, are privy to all the information we have on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Our basic approach begins with the conviction that for us to begin supplying any military equipment at all to Bangladesh would entail a fundamental change in our posture or in others perceptions of our posture. The Bengalees would certainly see it that way and so would also the Soviets and the Indians. What sort of ripostes the Soviets and/or the Indians might concoct is a matter of conjecture. They almost certainly would complicate the atmosphere for our aid and USIS. In short, is it worth the risk of trouble to get ourselves into the military supply act for the sake of “peanuts” in the terms of U.S. sales?</p>
                        <p>The next question we address is whether Bangladesh armed forces really need the items on their shopping list? Their manner of approaching us suggests that they simply are indulging in comparison shopping. The lack of ministerial or secretary-of-mission overtures argues against the notion that a refusal on our part would be taken as an <pb n="2" xml:id="d33-02" facs="d33-02"/>unfriendly gesture. We are left with the surmise that a substantial motive behind the shopping excursion is a concern for the moral of Bengalee military officers. There should be some more compelling motive to justify the U.S. Government's getting into the military supply activity in Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>Fighter aircraft fail into a special category. There is no reason that we know of for Bangladesh to have fighter aircraft at all. We have the distinct impression that the Soviet MIG's were forced on Mujib and that they constitute an embarrassment to the Mujib Government. How are the Bangalee going to pay for the MIG's? It is all too likely that no one knows. Perhaps the Soviets have not even dictated the terms yet, but it is almost certain that Bangladesh will have to pay. One of these days some maverick member of Parliament could be asking these questions openly. As we have reported earlier, my Australian colleague intends to see that questions are raised sooner rather than later.</p>
                        <p>We in the Embassy assume that there is no legitimate requirement for MIG's. Therefore no requirement to make the old F-86's airworthy either. On the contrary, I can think of many arguments for keeping the F-86's grounded. At a time when the chanceries of the world are being turned inside out to get more food for Bangladesh, when we have not yet delivered on our promises of edible oil, for example, what have we to gain by licensing spare parts for F-86's — when, so far as we know, the only Bengalees who care whether the F-86's fly or not are the pilots who trained in them in erstwhile Pakistan?</p>
                        <p>In classical War College terms, where is the threat? Territorially, Bangladesh is, to use James Michener's word, “encapsulated” by India. An external threat to Bangladesh is first of all a threat to India, or a threat from India. Do our strategic planners conceive of a threat to Bangladesh apart from a threat to India? Unless and until they do, we should hesitate to get involved in supplying military items to Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>In short, the country team is not ready at this time to recommend any relaxation of the arms embargo to Bangladesh. <pb n="3" xml:id="d33-03" facs="d33-03"/>The two majors who came to see Jay Freres might never come back again. If they do, I propose to tell them that the embargo continues to apply and that, in order to seek an exception, the Embassy would need to have a request from the <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> at the minister level. I would see no harm in providing the technical data as proposed in Cleve Fuller's July 30 letter.</p>
                        <p>If we are utterly out of phase with <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> thinking on this subject, do let me know meanwhile we operate on the assumption that U.S. interests in Bangladesh are strictly humanitarian. The ambience here is tricky enough even in the humanitarian field. Let us not make it more difficulty unless there are compelling reasons for change.</p>
                        <p>On the related subject of Bangladesh equipment needs for internal security, we are preparing separate letter, which ought to be ready for next week's pouch.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: O.K., Joe. I know it's 4 o'clock. Two minutes.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Pakistan has informed us that it has informed Bangladesh of its willingness to extend recognition prior to the opening of the Islamic conference on the 22nd of February, provided they can get the kind of iron-clad commitment from Bangladesh that in fact these 195 won't go on trial and so on.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Have we done something?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: They have asked us to intervene on it.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Have we done it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: No. We sent you a memo yesterday, which would ask that you send a personal message from you to each of the Foreign Ministers — which kind of gives them a polite pat on the back without intervening substantively. We think you can derive some benefit and each of the Ministers can, but to the Pakistan side — not <pb n="3" xml:id="d34-03" facs="d34-03"/>Foreign Minister. There's going to be a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of these four countries.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India — three.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Did I say four? I didn't realize I said four. There are only three that are involved. But, in any event, I would like to have you look at the message we sent you yesterday. We think this is the sort of thing you could say without getting into the middle of the substantiation.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Well, why can't we do just what we've been asked to do and inform Bangladesh to say, “We've been asked by Pakistan to transmit this to you"? We did it. That's how we broke the deadlock last August.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Well, largely because of the fact that we think it's going to move in this direction, based on a possible Foreign Ministers meeting. And, secondly, if that's the first step, I think you know we may get involved further; and I don't think it's necessary at this particular juncture. I think we can get the kind of credit of giving everybody a gentle pat on the back without getting anybody into an intimate negotiation on this thing.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d34-04" facs="d34-04"/>
                        <p>That would be my judgment.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: But, if we do, if Pakistan has asked us to pass this note to you or its idea to you for your consideration, you for your consideration, do we get into a negotiation?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: It's the beginning of a process. I have no objection to doing that, and that could very easily be added as a sentence to what we sent you. I think myself that they've gotten the pitch and they each know what the position is. And, in this particular instance, if we start that particular process, then the other side may very well come at the next stage and say, “Will you weigh in as follows on the following procedure?”</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: No. I agree that we shouldn't weigh in. We should just transmit it.</p>
                        <p>MR. LORD: For what it's worth, the Indian Minister told me they would welcome a pat on the back.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: What's a “pat on the back"? I don't understand what it means?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: A general encouragement that they sort this out.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Without telling them the specific idea.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: That's right. That's what I've <pb n="5" xml:id="d34-05" facs="d34-05"/>recommended to you in this piece of paper in your office.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: That seems to me more intrusive than to pass somebody's message. That gets us into a negotiation to which we haven't been asked.</p>
                        <p>MR <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: No I don't think so, Mr. Secretary. I think it's more intrusive the other way.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: O.K.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Bangladesh]</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Okay. Roger, what about the subcontinent summit?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName>: Mr. Secretary, the Delhi Agreement, among Bangladesh, Pakistan and India winds up the major issues left over from the 1971 war, in that the Bangladesh Government has agreed to return 195 prisoners of war that were being held for trial, for war crimes. And the Pakistanis have agreed to review their position on the numbers of Biharis to return to Pakistan. Inter alia, <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>, who was the Pakistani representative in Delhi, is cited in the communiqué as saying that the Government of Pakistan condemns and regrets any crimes that have been committed in connection with the fighting in '71; that Bhutto will visit Bangladesh, and that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> appeals to the people of Bangladesh to forgive and forget. And for his part, Mujib says that his people should forget and make a fresh start with Pakistanis.</p>
                        <p>Now, this agreement clears the way for progress in the next phase of a similar process which began in '72.</p>
                        <p>So we would anticipate that there will be progress on resumption of trade among the three countries, resumption of diplomatic relations by India and Pakistan, and initiation of relations in Dacca and Islamabad, and restoration of communications, including over-flights.</p>
                        <p>So the outlook, as we see it, is for slow but continuing progress on this front, until the basic issue of Kashmir hit, where we may come to a grinding halt.</p>
                        <p>The immediate implications seem to us to be that China will not oppose Bangladesh's entry into the United Nations. We would speculate that the Chinese might very well seek to establish influence Bangladesh to compete with the Soviets and the Indians. And the agreement provides a basis for improvement in China-India relations and Pakistani-Soviet relations.</p>
                        <p>It has seemed to us, Mr. Secretary, that our basic direct interests in the sub-continent are not major, as far as our U.S. interests are concerned. We are interested in stability, social and economic progress, <pb n="3" xml:id="d35-03" facs="d35-03"/>and seeing that the other power bloc does not exercise a predominant influence there.</p>
                        <p>So that this process seems to be in our interests and to point towards a continuation of our policy of encouraging normalization while sitting on the sidelines, and trying to stay out from in between.</p>
                        <p>While the prognosis on the political side may be favorable, we look at the economic side with some concern. The demographic problem, which probably brought the split off of the Eastern Province from Pakistan, subsequent to the cyclone and the ineptitude of the West Pakistan Government dealing with the consequences, the shortage of resources, all point to the population resource balance as being the major source of instability in the years ahead.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Could I raise one point. I will be seeing Moynihan on Friday. You will recall before you left he was waiting your go-ahead on whether he can open these discussions with the Indians. I think it would be very timely to tell him to go ahead when he goes back, Mr. Secretary. I know you are familiar with the substantive issue. SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: When is he going back?</p>
                        <p>MR <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Sometime next week.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d35-04" facs="d35-04"/>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Maybe I can see him before he goes back.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Sure.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary called on the Bangladesh Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</persName> at the latter's suite in the Waldorf Towers. Photographers took pictures while the Secretary and Prime Minister greeted each other.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I am very pleased to meet you and to welcome you to the United States. I am very much looking forward to my visit next month to Dacca.</p>
                        <p>THE PRIME MINISTER: I am also looking forward to your visit. Please accept my regrets for the unfortunate illness of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It is a great pleasure to see you here. In 1970 when Yahya Khan was here for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, he explained to me why the elections in Pakistan would be well manipulated. He said there were 20 parties in East Pakistan. There would be no majority party and Yahya would therefore have an excellent opportunity to maneuver to control the situation. Then of course you achieved your spectacular majority, with 167 out of 169 seats in East Pakistan. Ever since then I have never believed political predictions, unless of course you make them.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I gave my prediction before the election at a press conference in Dacca. I was asked if I would get 90% of <pb n="2" xml:id="d36-02" facs="d36-02"/>the votes. I said I would get 97%. Of course I have contested so many elections that I knew better than Yahya. I understood his ideas and plans to maneuver—</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: There would have been no elections if he had known how it would turn out. The last time I saw Yahya was on the way to China—the trip which he arranged for me. He gave a dinner for me and said at the table, “People call me a dictator.” He asked everyone: “Am I a dictator?” Everyone said “No.” Then he asked me, and I said: “I do not know, but for a dictator, you run a lousy election.”</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Would you like something to drink?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I would like some tea.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I am glad. I produce tea also. [Tea and coffee were served.]</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: As you know we are committed to the well-being of Bangladesh. Within our capacity we will do all we can to help you. Without meddling in Bangladesh's internal affairs, I want you to know that we believe you are the best guarantee for stability in your country, and we want to do what we can to help you.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Thank you. That is very kind of you. After I got out of jail, we faced such big problems. Then you gave us massive help and we avoided famine.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We will do what we can. We have committed 150,000 tons of foodgrains to Bangladesh in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We are trying to get approval for another 100,000 tons in this quarter, by the time you meet the President. I know that doesn't meet your total needs, but we have had a disappointing corn crop and that has put a strain on our wheat supplies.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Our problem is to try to recover and to be self-sufficient in food. We have made some progress. Our deficit of 3 million tons of rice is down to 2 million tons. We had no government when I got out of jail. We had nothing.</p>

                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Everything came from West Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: At the end of the struggle we had nothing. No money, no resources.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: When did you return? In January 1972?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes. When I returned everyone was armed and we had problems with that. Now we have a government. I have followed a policy of “forgive and forget” after coming out of jail.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We very much appreciated the trilateral agreements you have worked out with India and Pakistan. You have been very statesmanlike.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: This caused me some unpopularity because of the massacres that took place among intellectuals. I could give you names that you would recognize.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: The Bengalees are a rebellious lot. There were a number of Bengalees at Harvard when your Foreign Minister was a student of mine there.</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER: Yes there were a number of Bengalees including Mr. Murshed.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Is he all right?</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER: Yes.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: The Pakistani General, Farman Ali Khan, wrote on his scratch pad, and we found it, “The green land of East Pakistan must be painted red.” I told <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> about this when he came to Dacca. I showed it to him. I said to him, “Do something from your side.” There are 67,000 non-Bengalee families living in Bangladesh who have opted for Pakistan. They don't want them back. We don't want them. They are in camps. We can't feed them. We have no assets. I've done my duty. I'm the victim of genocide. Why can't the Pakistanis show generosity?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We strongly favor normalization of relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh. Our aim in the area will be to use any influence we have to promote normalization. I have the impression that it's a question of domestic politics in Pakistan. Is there anything concrete you want me to do?</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d36-04" facs="d36-04"/>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I have taken the liabilities. Why can't I have the assets? We received no gold, no planes, no ships. I have 75 million people. I have returned the prisoners of war to Pakistan. I could have held back 4,000 prisoners for bargaining. But I did not want to do that. I want good relations in South Asia. Bangladesh is a small country.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: With 75 million people Bangladesh is not a small country.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: We are small in territory. In the first two or three months of independence we rebuilt the roads and the bridges, we opened government institutions, we approved a constitution. Our senior civil servants were detained for two years in Pakistan. I have resources in Bangladesh —fertile land, many people, gas, coal and livestock. And we hope to find oil.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Is there coal in Bangladesh? Have you found oil?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: We have signed agreements with an American company for oil exploration and received bonus payments for the agreements.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY When you have the oil, perhaps we will borrow from you.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: You won't need to borrow. We will repay you for all you have done for us. We need a MARSHALL Plan in Bangladesh. We need foreign investment in fertilizer plants and in petrochemicals. We have natural gas and we can sell it. Flood control is a very serious problem. During the Pakistan days there was a mission to survey flood control in 1955 and 1956. During the British days they had dredges to clear out the rivers so that they could carry goods to Calcutta. After World War II when the British withdrew, there was no more dredging. The Government of Pakistan buried the survey report and went ahead with the Indus Basin Project in West Pakistan. They did nothing in Bangladesh, and now we are suffering the consequences. We had no way to save our cattle, our foodgrains, poultry and vegetables from the flood. We can find a solution between us. You organized the MARSHALL Plan for Germany's recovery. Now you can start a <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Plan for Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: If I can get my name on a plan, I will do just about anything.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d36-05" facs="d36-05"/>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: You have had such good success in Vietnam and the Middle East. You can have success in Bangladesh. There are famine conditions in my country.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: The domestic situation in this country is much less favorable than it was at the time of the MARSHALL Plan. In fact, the domestic situation is unfavorable. Candidly, I must say that that sort of program is not likely. On the other hand we are joining the Bangladesh Consortium. We favor the most rapid development possible for your country. In 1971 our dispute with India was related to our China policy. We supported the independence of Bangladesh by peaceful methods. We will do the maximum that we can, but you should not have exalted expectations. We will be extremely active in the Consortium. Your problems will receive special attention. The fact that I am going to Dacca means that I will give them special attention.</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER: Our problem is that we need a margin of time….</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It is the curse of bureaucracies that they only do enough to avoid crises but not enough to solve the underlying problems. I personally favor taking big steps. We will have to look again at your problems. I will meet with Mr. McNamara and we will see what we can do. Will you meet with him?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes, in Washington. He has been kind enough to see me.</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER: We need 3 or 4 years' margin to work on long term development.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Can you become self-sufficient?</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER: Yes, in 3 or 4 years.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We are looking for another 100,000 tons in this current quarter.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: And without prejudice for the rest of the year. We will be considering what additional foodgrain we can provide.</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER: We need vegetable oil, fertilizer and project aid for the development of all our resources to increase exports so that we can get out of the current situation. We have no political problems. We are still winning by-elections in spite of our 40% inflation rate.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d36-06" facs="d36-06"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Take about 15 minutes in your meeting with the President to advise him on how you do this.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I set up 4,300 Union Councils in Bangladesh. I have to provide a free kitchen in every Union Council.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Do you travel a lot?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I try to mobilize the people to be self-sufficient, so that the country can be self-sufficient.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How are your relations with India?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Very good. We have a foreign policy that is neutral, non-aligned and independent. We have good relations with India, USA,<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Burma. We are very anxious for good relations with China.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We are improving our relations with India.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: We welcome that. We have a Friendship Treaty with India and a Commission on River Control. I want to convey to you my assurances of our good relations. When I came out of jail, there was anti-US sentiment in Bangladesh. Now all my people are extremely friendly to the US.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You showed great wisdom when you came out of jail. There must have been a great temptation to demagoguery and to deal harshly with Pakistan and the US. We have always had great sympathy for the Bengalees. It is a natural friendship on our side.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes. Your long-standing interest is greatly appreciated.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You have a special place in the hearts of Americans. On food for example, we are making a special effort.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I am grateful for what you are doing today and for the massive food help you have provided.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You went to the UK and then back to Bangladesh. Did you take over the government immediately?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes. It was very difficult. Everyone was armed and that created a serious problem. I appealed for everyone to <pb n="7" xml:id="d36-07" facs="d36-07"/>surrender their arms. 150,000 arms were surrendered to me. The Pakistanis had armed everyone. The Pakistan military asked permission to arm civilians. We have documents that show the Pakistan Army asked permission to arm civilians at the end.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How about the Chinese? Are they doing anything subversive in your country? Do you have relations yet?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Not yet. We know each other. I went to Peking in 1958 and they came to Dacca in 1962. I want friendship with China but we have our self-respect. I can offer friendship but the initiative has to come from them also. We appreciate the US support for Bangladesh in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. You steadily supported us there from the first day.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: My impression is that China will start to move in the next year to normalize its relations with you. They are concerned about India, but they do not have anything against Bangladesh. They will move slowly. Yours is the right policy: friendship with all the Big Powers and avoid all their quarrels. We certainly don't object to your good relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Thank you. You've done wonderful things over the last two years.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It is easy to conduct relations for an established country, but your Foreign Minister has had to conduct relations for a new country—to start from nothing. That is much more difficult. Were you released together?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes. After they released me, I asked them why they forgot my friend. I asked them to release him because he was my Foreign Affairs Adviser.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Were you treated badly?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: They kept me in solitary confinement. The conditions were bad. It was 117 degrees.</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER: I was a little cooler because I was in the <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: The case they made against me was a farce.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY : We exerted very great pressure.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d36-08" facs="d36-08"/>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes. I know you did. They tried to kill me on the night of the 16th. The officer-in-charge took me out and hid me for five days near the Chashma Barrage. They planned to say that there had been a revolt of the prisoners and the prisoners had killed me. They tried to kill me three times: in 1958, when Martial Law came, they arrested me; in 1966 they arrested me on a conspiracy charge; in 1971 they arrested me and tried to kill me. I am living on extensions.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You have six more lives to live. They say that cats have nine lives. But you have made a great achievement. You have created a new state. You will find that the President will be very sympathetic in your talks tomorrow. We have our own difficulties with Congressional limits on aid and with our own food shortages, but we will make a special effort. I look forward to seeing you again in Bangladesh at the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I have this special problem with these people who do not want to remain in Bangladesh. I have to do something. Should I expel them like Idi Amin did?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You mean the Biharis?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Pakistan won't take them? We will take these questions up when we are there. You can explain this in more detail.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I have nothing in my hand to bargain with. I have taken risks. They killed professors, intellectuals, journalists just before the surrender. I have to explain this to my people. I never go back on my word, but this time I did. I said that they would be tried on Bangladesh soil. There has been no trial.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It was a very humane and statesmanlike act to forego trials, so that you could work for a long-term relationship. I will take this up.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: As the Prime Minister and the Secretary left the Prime Minister's suite Bangladesh reporters asked for comments on the meeting. The Secretary said that he and the Prime Minister <pb n="9" xml:id="d36-09" facs="d36-09"/>had a very warm and friendly discussion. They had discussed the economic development and the well-being of Bangladesh. They had discussed ways in which the US might help with immediate problems and with long-term development. The Prime Minister stated that they had a warm and friendly discussion. He was glad to hear the Secretary's views on Bangladesh and expressions of concern for Bangladesh. The Prime Minister said the Secretary understood Bangladesh's problems and will try to do his best for Bangladesh. He noted that US-Bangladesh relations are very good and will grow stronger.</p>
                        <p>Both participants made similar comments to American newspapermen who questioned them subsequently. The Secretary was asked whether he had set a date for his visit to South Asia. The Secretary said he hoped to have something on that later this week.</p>
                        <p>Questioned about the Washington Post story that morning on the relationship between Bangladesh's sale of jute bags to Cuba and the signing of a PL 480 agreement, the Prime Minister brushed it aside, and the Secretary said the subject did not come up in their discussion. The Secretary introduced the Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HK2">KAMAL HOSSAIN</persName> to the press as “another student of mine.”</p>

                        <p>It is good to have you here. It is the first time an American President has met with the head of state of Bangladesh.</p>

                            </hi>: You know the history of my country. Its condition after the war was likened to that of Germany in 1945. I want to thank you for your help to us. Before the war we were divided by India. The capital was all in <pb n="2" xml:id="d37-02" facs="d37-02"/>the west. Bangladesh wasn't too bad in '47. Seventy percent of the representatives in the Parliament were from the West; I was in the Parliament. Most of the Administration was destroyed in the war or left for India. Even in the rest we couldn't get out of the West. Everyone has been suffering, first from the war, then from drought, then from the floods. Thanks to help from countries like you, no one is starving. We have had to import everything. Since then we started to bring our trade deficit down, until the inflation, drought and the floods came.</p>
                        <p>Bangladesh has resources. If we could control the floods, we could be self-sufficient in five years. We produce rice, jute, wheat, and tobacco. We have big gas deposits — 10-20 trillion cubic feet. We were almost self-sufficient in fertilizer but our plants were damaged. With our own gas and fertilizer plants we could begin to export fertilizer, except for inflation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We have been telling the OPEC countries that if their high prices result in the problems that you and the industrial countries are having, the high prices will bring a collapse and won't help them.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: There is 250,000 tons of food grains that are being made available for you. As we look at our food picture we will do what we can. We had hoped for a bigger crop. We had a wet spring and then a drought, and now an early frost. So our crop is disappointing. We must see what we have and we will do our very best with what we have.</p>

We have signed contracts with Atlantic-Richfield and Union Oil. Eventually we can export. But that is in the future, and my crisis is immediate.</p>

                        <p>We won a majority in Pakistan. We are doing our best to be friends with them. Though millions were killed, or jailed or exiled, we want to forget. We released the Pakistani prisoners, including 195 war criminals. We think we should get some share of the old Pakistani assets. Yet I have had to take on the liabilities of the new country. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> came to Dacca and I told him this, but so far nothing has happened. Also there are 700,000 non-Bengalees in my country. 400,000 want to stay in Bangladesh. That is fine. But Pakistan won't take the others who want to go there. I have to feed my people. How can I take care of my people when I have to take care of these?</p>
                        <p>I wanted to present these problems to you. I want good relations with everyone.</p>

MUJIB APPEARS TO HAVE LEFT THE U.S. SATISFIED WITH HIS RECEPTION AND TREATMENT. END SUMMARY.</p>

                            <item>MUJIB'S OBJECTIVES. MUJIB'S ADDRESS TO THE UNGA, HIS MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">FORD</persName>, SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>, SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN, AND THE VIP TREATMENT ACCORDED HIM ALL SERVED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE U.S. RECOGNIZES BANGLADESH AS ONE OF THE POWERS OF THE SUBCONTINENT, WITH WHOM WE ENJOY GOOD RELATIONS. IN ADDITION, PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">FORD</persName>'S ASSURANCES OF CONCERN FOR BANGLADESH'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND THE PROMISE OF PL-480 FOODGRAINS CONSTITUTED TANGIBLE EVIDENCE OF CONTINUED U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. FROM MUJIB'S POINT OF VIEW, THIS VISIT HAS APPARENTLY FULFILLED ITS PURPOSE.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>OUR OBJECTIVES. FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW ALSO THE TRIP WENT WELL. THE MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">FORD</persName> AND SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> WERE CONDUCTED IN A CORDIAL ATMOSPHERE AT SOME LENGTH AND COVERED THE GROUND OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS (WHICH WE BOTH AGREED ARE EXCELLENT), THE GENERAL PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION IN THE SUBCONTINENT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, AND BANGLADESH'S ECONOMIC SITUATION.</item>

                            <item>AN OPPORTUNITY LOST. AT THE SAME TIME, LITTLE PRESS AND PUBLIC ATTENTION WAS GENERATED BY MUJIB'S VISIT, REFLECTING THE REALITY OF SHORT MEMORIES AND BANGLADESH'S LOW NEWS PRIORITY. IN PART, HOWEVER, THE BENGALEE SIDE FAILED TO MAKE THE MOST OF ITS OPPORTUNITIES. MUJIB AND HIS PARTY FAILED TO DRAMATIZE PUBLICLY THE INTENSITY OF BANGLADESH'S CURRENT DIFFICULTIES. THEY WERE SELECTIVE <pb n="2" xml:id="d38-02" facs="d38-02"/>IN THEIR TREATMENT OF THE PRESS: MUJIB GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WASHINGTON POST, BUT NOT TO OTHERS. MUJIB DID NOT MEET THE PRESS CORPS AFTER HIS MEETING WITH <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">FORD</persName>, BUT LEFT IT TO <persName corresp="#p_HK2">KAMAL HOSSAIN</persName>. THE NEW YORK TIMES, NEWSWEEK AND TIME ALL HOSTED SOCIAL EVENTS FOR THE PRIME MINISTER IN NEW YORK, BUT LITTLE HAS APPEARED IN THE PRESS BEYOND TWO-LINERS AND A PHOTO OF MUJIB EMBRACING THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR, <persName corresp="#p_YKS1">SAHABZADA YAQUB KHAN</persName>, WHICH PROVIDED THE SINGLE DRAMATIC MOMENT OF A BENGALEE-HOSTED WASHINGTON RECEPTION.</item>

                            <item>SPEECHES. MUJIB'S MAIN PUBLIC THEMES WERE BANGLADESH'S DIFFICULT ECONOMIC SITUATION, AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND NEGLECT IN PAKISTAN TIMES, AND THE NEED FOR PAKISTAN TO MATCH BANGLADESH'S GENEROSITY IN REACHING ACCOMMODATION ON THE ISSUES REMAINING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. HIS UN SPEECH REFERRED TO BANGLADESH'S “ULTIMATE CONTRIBUTION” IN GRANTING CLEMENCY TO THE 195 POW'S, AGAINST WHOM THERE WAS “OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE OF HAVING COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.” THESE WERE THE THEMES OF HIS PRIVATE PRESENTATIONS ALSO.</item>

                            <item>SCHEDULE. THE BENGALEES ARRANGED A FULL SCHEDULE FOR MUJIB IN NEW YORK. IN ADDITION TO LUNCHES, DINNERS AND HIS SPEECH TO THE <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, HE APPEARED ON A SUNDAY TELEVISION PROGRAM, ADDRESSED THE ASIA SOCIETY AT A LUNCHEON, AND MET DAVID ROCKEFELLER (AMONG OTHERS) WHOM HE INVITED TO BANGLADESH AS A GUEST OF THE <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss>. IN WASHINGTON, MUJIB MET PRIVATELY WITH ROBERT MCNAMARA AND SENATORS <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">KENNEDY</persName> AND MCGOVERN, TALKED WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF AID AND THE IBRD OVER LUNCHEON, AND WAS HOSTED AT COFFEE BY A JOINT MEETING OF THE HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEES. WHILE THE BENGALEES WERE PLEASED WITH BLAIR HOUSE AND THE USAF AIRCRAFT, THEY TURNED DOWN OUR OFFER TO HAVE A LUNCHEON HOSTED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL SAXBE (THE SECRETARY WAS IN NEW YORK, AND THE SUGGESTION HAD BEEN MADE ON THE BASIS OF BENGALEE INITIAL INTEREST IN AN EVENT HOSTED BY A CABINET MEMBER). THEIR RECEPTION, WHICH WAS POORLY ATTENDED, CONSTITUTED THE ONLY LARGE SOCIAL EVENT FOR MUJIB IN WASHINGTON. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> BT</item>

                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: I am grateful to you for finding the time to come here.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You were kind enough to invite me.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: I am glad you could see the love and affection of my people. It is sometimes very difficult to understand our position.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Once I can associate the issues and personalities of a country by visiting the place, it tells me a great deal that will be helpful to me in the future. It is particularly so when I am received as warmly as I was here.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: We can't give you too much comfort in physical arrangements here.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d39-02" facs="d39-02"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You have been very helpful and the guest house is extremely comfortable and pleasant.</p>
                        <p>We reviewed with your Foreign Minister this afternoon a wide variety of problems. I would be happy to talk about whatever issues interest you most. We reviewed international events and I indicated in what areas we want to be helpful. The progress and development of Bangladesh are matters we have very much in mind.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: You know our stand on these things. Who doesn't know you? As far as I am concerned, I can perhaps discuss subcontinental matters.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That would be very interesting for me.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: I don't like to go into a great deal of background. If you review the history of our pre-independence period, however, you will find that East Pakistan earned as much as 75 percent of Pakistan's foreign exchange. I was a member of the National Constituent Assembly in 1956. You know that background.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What was the population then?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: In 1947 the population of this area was about 40 million.</p>
                        <p>Again, I don't really like to go into the background of our troubles. But it should be remembered that it was the soil of Bangladesh that suffered in 1971 and not that of Pakistan. I showed Bhutto when he was here this summer some of the evidence of this. I showed him for example the order issued by General Farman Ali that “the green land of Bangladesh must be painted red”. That was an instruction to his forces. I have that and showed it to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We thought the Pakistanis would he generous. But I must be frank with you. Pakistan seeks only diplomatic relations with us. Nothing else. We did our part. We released all the POWs. But then when we want to discuss a division of assets they say nothing. We did not ask for a concrete assurance of assets but we ask that they give us some idea of what could be done.</p>
                        <p>But when <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> came, he didn't agree to anything. He only spoke of diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d39-03" facs="d39-03"/>
                        <p>I have got 75 million people who have nothing. I have nothing from the Pakistanis; they have the planes, the ships, the reserves.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I talked to <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> following our last meeting in New York. He referred to your unwillingness to consider the problem of shared liabilities.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: But I have already assumed responsibility for the liabilities! We made an agreement on this with the creditors. But why can't I get some assurance on assets?</p>
                        <p>And then there is the question of the Biharis. These people opted for Pakistan! Now they refuse to accept them. There are problems in doing this in Karachi, I know. But there should be no problem to absorb them in the Punjab. I have no land; only 75 million people. How long will it be before other countries do something to help us on this?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Are they in camps now?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: That is almost the case. We have to give them rations. Those who have opted for Bangladesh can stay here. I have given them jobs.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Are you proposing to permit the Biharis to stay if they want?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Yes, 400,000 of them. But another 300,000 opted for Pakistan. That is my point.</p>
                        <p>I have no hatred in my heart. I have no quarrel with anyone. I want peace with all countries. I cannot ask that other countries go on helping us indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>I have set up 5,303 food kitchens and we feed 100,000 people every day. Our problems are very difficult and the floods this year made things worse.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: This is obviously a very important reality that you are describing. We talked this afternoon about possibilities in the area of international flood control measures.</p>
                        <p>Did you want me to speak to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> about some of these things?</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d39-04" facs="d39-04"/>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: You are welcome to do so.</p>
                        <p>But one should not only talk; one should assist! They should know that people are dying here; they have land and can be helpful.</p>
                        <p>As for flood control, that is important. We have been suffering for a long time. For the big rivers we have the Joint River Commission with India.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What causes the floods, the rivers or the sea?</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_HK2">HOSSAIN</persName>: There are two aspects of the problem. This year it was the rivers. But in 1970, it was a tidal bore from the sea.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: If we could only control the rivers, it would be helpful through embankments and small projects. In five years, if we can mobilize our resources, we can cope with the food problem. Of course we need also to deal with population planning.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Are you reclaiming land from the Bay of Bengal?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Yes, a total of 200 square miles in one area will be available next year.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Will you settle people there for cultivation?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Yes, we must do it.</p>
                        <p>I thank you very much for the 150,000 tons of food grains and the 100,000 additional tons you are providing now.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It is essential in the present situation.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: We need one or two years more of food support. I need massive assistance to make my country self-sufficient. We need help in raw materials for our industries. We need better prices for our jute.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You seem to get hit from all sides.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: We have a fertilizer factory now being built with Japanese support. We have experts coming from Japan and the UK to assist in our fertilizer plants and especially to look into <pb n="5" xml:id="d39-05" facs="d39-05"/>the plant which recently suffered an explosion. We don't blame anyone for this. Certainly not the Japanese who are our good friends. The UK experts will also help us. Until they have done this the facts are difficult to come by as to this explosion.</p>
                        <p>We can be self-sufficient in area production. We are also getting some additional fertilizer factory help from India.</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BDE2">BOSTER</persName>: The U.S. is also helping in this area, with a $30 million loan for the Ashugan fertilizer factory.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That is the real way to deal with the food production problem. We and others can help, but the real effort must be made by your country.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: We are not sitting idle. We are producing food from our own land. We have a compulsory procurement effort underway to get reserves.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Are you trying to build up your stocks?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: We need to build a buffer for emergencies.</p>
                        <p>FOREIGN MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_HK2">HOSSAIN</persName>: It is essentially an anti-hoarding measure.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I told the Foreign Minister earlier that I am giving a major speech next week at the World Food Conference in which I will describe our overall approach to the food problem. Thereafter we will try to better organize ourselves within our own government. What we need to do is not simply provide help in food but also, and perhaps more important, assist with technology and fertilizer so that other countries can grow more food. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDE2">Boster</persName> will be following up with you on this after my speech.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Unfortunately we are not getting any assistance or recognition from the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have the impression, however, that this will come along.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: We are waiting and ready for relations.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d39-06" facs="d39-06"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: They may prefer to wait until Pakistan has established relations with you.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: That might be. They are a big power and it is up to them.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately many of my people are dying every day. In part because Pakistan has taken everything from me.</p>
                        <p>We have no problem with good Pakistan-U.S. relations. You can be a friend with everyone. China too can do what it wishes.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: May I repeat your views to the Chinese regarding your desire for better relations?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Of course. I know Chou En-Lai. He came to Dacca at one time and I went there as the head of a delegation from Pakistan in 1957. I was there in 1952 also. He came here in 1956. That was a turning point in our relations with China at that time.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That was an astonishing turn of events. I never thought at that time that Pakistan and China would become so close.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Chou En-Lai got a very good reception when he visited Pakistan the first time.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I told your Foreign Minister earlier that I thought the Chinese could establish a very good relationship here. President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> very much appreciated meeting you in Washington. You bamboozled him!</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: I liked him very much. He was very frank.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: He gave instructions thereafter to us to see what we could do further to help on food for Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Please give him my warm regards. He would be welcome to come to Bangladesh. He can come here when he goes to India.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Yes. When he comes to India he could come here too. However, we don't think we need the permission of India in any way in our dealings with Bangladesh.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d39-07" facs="d39-07"/>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: That is right. When you deal with Bangladesh you are dealing with us and not with someone else.</p>
                        <p>I'd like you to see the food camps we have set up. My people are dying from hunger. The cattle are dying. I have to feed my people and I must give them jobs. This comes on top of our rehabilitation effort. We face very serious problems.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Our problem is that we no longer have food surpluses. Five years ago we did and were in a position to make long-term projections. Now we need to wait until each year's crop is in before we attempt any projections.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: I know you have great difficulty in this respect.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: But Bangladesh has very high priority with us.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Pakistan gives us no help. They are not prepared to give us any ships or to share their reserves. None the less, we have tried to make do on our own.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Obviously you have made progress in improving your position.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: We have done something in three years. We have restored communications, repaired roads, restored bridges and resumed cultivation. We've done something!</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I know. And world inflation trends make things very difficult for you.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Will you have some tea? Bananas?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I am trying to reduce.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: The Pakistanis also destroyed my banana trees.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Has your climate changed in any way?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: I don't know but we faced serious problems in the flood this summer. Seventeen districts were underwater. I have very fertile land and can produce wheat and rice and we are already self-sufficient in sugar this year.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d39-08" facs="d39-08"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We have problems in our own Congress on aid matters. We have Congressional elections next Tuesday. Of course, we don't predict that the Administration will win a majority of the kind you did in 1970!</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Don't get that many seats! You see what happened when I did. The Pakistanis came and destroyed my country and they arrested me. My five-year old understood it perfectly; she said to me later, “Don't ever stand for elections again!” My country suffered a tidal bore, civil war, cyclones, and full-scale war. That's what I get for my election results!</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I assume that does not mean you intend to avoid elections for a while!</p>
                        <p>My own desire and that of President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> is that we should do the maximum to help Bangladesh. On food, we can certainly do some more in the second half of fiscal 75.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Please don't forget other things like flood control so that we can grow more food.</p>
                        <p>Population growth is difficult for us.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That is happening everywhere.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Yes, but your people are educated. We have no variety of life. We have developed an overall health plan and this will help. I expect to go to Egypt on the fifth of this month, for four days.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I may be there about the same time. I'm trying to find out what went on at Rabat.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: You are doing your best.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I like <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">Sadat</persName>. Do you?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Very much.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Do you like Assad?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Yes, I like him too. He is a dramatic person.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d39-09" facs="d39-09"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It's not that Bangladesh's leaders are without color!</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: We have had a long struggle and gone through catastrophic times. Twice the Pakistanis tried to kill me but I came out alive. Your government helped.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We did apply pressure although we didn't know exactly where they were keeping you. We made many representations.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: If I had been killed, the 93,000 Pakistani soldiers in Bangladesh at that time would have been in serious trouble immediately. But I have forgotten all of this. I want peace in the subcontinent. Just as you acted after your war in Germany. We want Pakistan to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: So the major issues are the assets and repatriation questions?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Nothing else. It's up to Pakistan. I have nothing in hand. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> knows what the Pakistanis did to us. I showed him evidence that General Farman Ali tried to “paint the green of Bangladesh red”, a quotation which we found as an order by Farman Ali to his forces.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What did <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> say?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: He was astonished and showed it to all his friends sitting here in this room.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> told me in New York he wanted you to assume responsibility for liabilities, too; not only to consider the assets issue.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: But I have done that, for all visible projects in Bangladesh. Everything else is in Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Was it a deliberate Pakistani policy to keep the east wing backward?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Yes. We were colonized for 25 years! That was on top of 200 years in the British period.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d39-10" facs="d39-10"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: When did you decide you wanted independence? Not at first, I think. You could have been Prime Minister of Pakistan!</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Of course. Ayub offered this to me at the time of his Round Table Conference. I was for a long time a leading political figure in Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Can Pakistan overcome its current political problems?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: Force won't do. The army is from the Punjab. They can't keep the Baluchis down. But <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is a politician and he will try to deal with it in that way. I hope he will do it.</p>
                        <p>I have agreed to the release of all the POWs because I wanted to help <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. I have done it intentionally. If I had not done this the military would again have come to power in Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That was farsighted of you.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: A leader should lead his people and not let the people lead him.</p>
                        <p>With help I have resources in my country to build a strong economy. I have gas, limestone deposits, and we are working to control the floods. We have signed contracts with American companies to search for oil in the Bay of Bengal.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: If you find oil, you can join OPEC!</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: I have natural gas to sell now. We can use this to make fertilizer and develop other resources. It is not that we do not have resources. We have them. We could produce three times the food we do now.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: But population control is obviously also very important.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: I have to educate my people for this. We are still recovering from the wounds of the war.</p>
                        <p>Let me repeat how glad I am that you have come to Bangladesh. When the President comes we hope you will come with him. We will make a treat for him; we can show him Bengal tigers!</p>
                        <p>I have always wanted friendship with the U.S. I said that as soon as I came out of prison in Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>PRIME MINISTER MUJIB: That reflects our overall policy of friendship to all and malice toward none.</p>

                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Let's talk about Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: Well, it was a remarkably well-planned and executed coup for Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: What does that mean? Is Mujibur alive or dead?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">Mujibur</persName> is dead; his immediate clique, which was largely family, nephews, brothers.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I get good advice from <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: He wasn't dead when I talked to you.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d42-03" facs="d42-03"/>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Really? Did they kill him after some period?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: As far as we know — I can't say we have got all the details. But the indications are that the plan was to kill him. And they simply surrounded his palace and went in and killed him. That is as far as we know now.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Didn't we tell him that last year?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: In March we had lots of indications—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Didn't we tell him about it?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: We told him at the time.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Didn't we tell him who it was going to be, roughly?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I will have to check whether we gave him the names.</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: We were a little imprecise on that.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: He brushed it off, scoffed at it, said nobody would do a thing like that to him.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: He was one of the world's prize fools.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: But it seems that the coup leaders are in complete control.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Who are they?</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d42-04" facs="d42-04"/>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: They are military officers, middle and senior officers, who are generally considered less pro-Indian than the past leadership; pro-U.S., anti-Soviet.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Absolutely inevitable.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: Islamic. They have changed the name to the Islamic Republic —</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: That they would be pro-U.S. was not inevitable. In fact, I would have thought at some turn of the wheel they were going to become pro-Chinese, and anti-Indian I firmly expected. I always knew India would rue the day that they made Bangladesh independent. I predicted that since '71.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I think our biggest problem is going to be to avoid too close an embrace.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Why — because they are friendly to us?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I think they are going to want us to come in with promises.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: The principle being we only embrace on the sub-continent those who oppose us. What is the principle?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I think our principle ought to be we are giving about all the aid we can really give or Bangladesh <pb n="5" xml:id="d42-05" facs="d42-05"/>can really absorb.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Before we implement it, let's check that. I know we can't do a huge increase in aid. But I think if people who think they are pro-U.S. come to us and then get a technical lecture that unfortunately we can't do any more — there must be some maneuvering we can do on food aid and some token increase in aid.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: We can do a little more on food aid.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I would like them to get it, if they are indeed what you say they are, which I don't know.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: These are all the initial indications.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Then they ought to get a friendly reception.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I think the immediate question is how we comport ourselves with the new government. It seems to me despite what the memo says which we sent you, which I didn't have time to go over carefully this morning — I think we ought to simply respond to any overtures.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: What did the memo say?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: It says we ought to hold off on a decision on recognition. But I don't think that needs to be posed as that sharp a question.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: We ought to recognize.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d42-06" facs="d42-06"/>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I don't know what recognizing means in this case. I think we simply —</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Just continue. That memo said also we have to check all this with the Indians, as if to give the Indians a veto. I certainly don't agree with that.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I think it would be useful —</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: We certainly shouldn't go to the Indians.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I think there might be some merit in an exchange of views with them.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: After we have done it. We will not even discuss establishing contact with the new government with the Indians. After contact is established, we would be interested to hear their views, as long as they clearly understand that they cannot tell us what to do, and as long as they cannot go to the Bangladesh and tell them — and then ask Bangladesh for their views, so that they can be transmitted to us.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I fully agree.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Which is what India would dearly love to do.</p>
                        <p>You better let me see any approaches.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I think we have to prepare a telegram <pb n="7" xml:id="d42-07" facs="d42-07"/>today, and we will clear it with you, on what we say to the Indians. And the Pakistanis are important. There will be some move towards Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I also want to see you for a few minutes on a sober instruction to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, and some of his ideas on commitments. Okay.</p>

                            <item>PRELIMINARY COMMENT ON THE COUP IN BANGLADESH</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. THE EVENTS OF THE FIRST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS GIVE PROMISE THAT THE COUP WHICH BEGAN AT 0515 LOCAL TIME ON AUGUST 15 WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED. THE OATHS OF FEALTY TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT SWORN BY THE SERVICE CHIEFS, THE HEADS OF THE PARAMILITARY BANGLADESH RIFLES AND RAKKHI BAHINI AND THE HEAD OF THE POLICE BRING ALL ARMED ELEMENTS INTO SUPPORT OF THE NEW REGIME. THE PUBLIC HAS DISPLAYED NO PARTICULAR JIBILATION AT THE FALL OF MUJIB BUT RATHER A CALM ACCEPTANCE, AND PERHAPS SOME SENSE OF RELIEF. THE RELATIVE EASE WITH WHICH POWER HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED SUGGESTS ABOVE ALL THE DEGREE TO WHICH MUJIB AND THE BANGALEES HAD BECOME ALIENATED FROM ONE ANOTHER, THE BANGALEES FROM MUJIB BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURE TO MEET THEIR ASPIRATIONS AND HIS APPARENT DESIRE TO HOLD POWER LARGELY FOR PERSONAL AGRANDIZEMENT AND DYNASTIC REASONS, AND MUJIB</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>PAGE 02 DACCA 03964 161135Z</p>
                        <p>FROM THE BANGLAEES AS HE GREW MORE ISOLATED FROM OBJECTIVE COUNSELS AND BEGAN TO SUFFER THE CLASSIC PARANOIA OF THE DESPOT. THE QUICKENING TEMPO OF <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">SHEIKH MUJIB</persName>'S EFFORTS SINCE EARLY JUNE TO INSURE HIS STRANGLEHOLD ON POWER, TOGETHER WITH THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF HIS NEPHEW SHEIKH MONI, DOUBTLESS MADE THE COUP PLOTTERS CONCLUDE THAT NO FURTHER DELAYS IN TAKING ACTION WAS POSSIBLE. THAT INDIA'S INDEPENDENCE DAY WAS CHOSEN MAY HAVE BEEN MERELY INCIDENTAL, BUT WE NOTE THE COINCIDENCE.</p>
                        <p>2. IT IS TOO EARLY TO OFFER ANY SURE OPINIONS ON THE DIRECTION OF EVENTS. THE NEW CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT UNDER <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">KHONDAKAR MUSHTAQUE AHMED</persName> SEEMS LITTLE LIKELY TO AROUSE ANY SENSE OF ENTHUSIASM. ALTHOUGH PURGED—BY DEATH OR EXCLUSION—OF THOSE WHO WERE CLOSEST TO <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">SHEIKH MUJIB</persName>, IT IS STILL A COLLECTION OF OVERLY FAMILIAR FIGURES WHO ARE IDENTIFIED WITH THE POOR ADMINISTRATION OF POST-LIBERATION BANGLADESH. CLEARLY, ITS COMPOSITION IS INTENDED TO SUGGEST THAT BANGLADESH UNDER <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">MUSHTAQUE</persName> WILL OFFER CONTINUITY, BUT ALSO THAT THERE WILL BE GREATER MODERATION. <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">MUSHTAQUE</persName>'S RADIO ADDRESS LATE ON AUGUST 15 (DACCA 3955) SUPPORTS THIS VIEW, CONDEMNING AS IT DOES THE DOMESTIC CONSEQUENCES OF <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">SHEIKH MUJIB</persName>'S RULE BUT CLEARLY SUGGESTING THAT INSOFAR AS FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARE CONCERNED, BUSINESS WILL BE MUCH AS USUAL. THERE IS ALREADY SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL WANT TO STRENGTHEN ITS TIES WITH THE MUSLIM WORLD, INCLUDING PAKISTAN. AT THE SAME TIME, <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">MUSHTAQUE</persName>'S WELL-KNOWN ANTIPATHY TO INDIA NOTWITHSTANDING, THE NEW REGIME WILL NOT WANT TO AROUSE UNDUE SUSPICIONS ON THE PART OF INDIA, CLEARLY COGNIZANT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING AN ADEQUATE MEASURE OF GOODWILL ON THE PART OF ITS IMPOSING NEIGHBOR. (PERHAPS ONE REASON FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE CABINET, WITH ITS EXCLUSIVE RELIANCE ON OLD FACES, IS A HOPE TO DEMONSTRATE TO INDIA ITS BASIC CONTINUITY.) INSOFAR AS THE MAJOR POWERS ARE CONCERNED, <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">MUSHTAQUE</persName> HAS STATED HIS GOVERNMENT'S DESIRE TO ESTABLISH “CLOSER AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE BIG POWERS LIKE THE UNITED STATES, THE SOVIET UNION AND CHINA.” THIS WOULD SEEM TO MEAN MORE BALANCE IN ITS RELATIONS, AND THUS SOME DIMINUTION IN THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOVIET UNION.</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>PAGE 03 DACCA 03964 161135Z</p>
                        <p>3. THE EVIDENCE SO FAR SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR OWN RELATIONS WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT COULD TURN OUT TO BE ON AN EVEN MORE CORDIAL BASIS THAN THEY WERE UNDER MUJIB. THE NEW PRESIDENT HAS IN THE PAST BEEN STRIKINGLY OVERT IN SUGGESTING HIS “PRO-AMERICAN” ATTITUDE; MOREOVER, THE FIGURES IN THE OLD REGIME WHO WERE KNOWN FOR THEIR LEFTIST AND ANTI-AMERICAN VIEWS (SHEIKH MONI AND <persName>SAMAD</persName>, EXAMPLE) ARE NOW GONE. THE POSSIBILITY IS ALSO STRONG THAT THEY WILL LOOK TO US FOR EVEN LARGER AMOUNTS OF AID— <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">MUSHTAQUE</persName> HAS ARGUED WITH US BEFORE THAT WE ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN TRULY HELP BANGLADESH—SO THAT OUR PROBLEM MAY WELL PROVE TO BE ONE OF TEMPERING THE NEW REGIME'S EXPECTATIONS OF US.</p>
                        <p>4. WE CANNOT PRESENTLY JUDGE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">MUSHTAQUE</persName>'S GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY. WE NOTE WITH INTEREST THAT EVERY OFFICIAL STATEMENT STRESSES THE ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THE TAKEOVER. WE ARE TOLD THAT THEY MILITARY ARE AT PRESENT ENGAGED IN PREPARING MARTIAL LAW ORDERS WHICH WOULD, IF THE PAKISTANI PATTERN IS FOLLOWED, SERVE AS BASIS LAW OF THE COUNTRY. WHETHER THIS MEANS A GROWTH OF TENSION BETWEEN THE CIVILIANS AND THE MILITARY WE CANNOT YET SAY, BUT WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE FIRST STATEMENTS BY <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">MUSHTAQUE</persName> WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROMISE OF A NEW, MORE LIBERAL CONSTITUATION THAN THAT IMPOSED LAST JANUARY BY MUJIB. THE CIVILIANS PROBABLY HAVE A MOMENTARY ADVANTAGE IN LIGHT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE; MOREOVER, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE MILITARY'S SUCCESSFUL OUSTER OF MUJIB, WE ARE LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THE COUP PLANNERS PREPARED FOR LITTLE BEYOND THE EVENT ITSELF. HOWEVER, THE MILITARY—AND BY THIS WE MEAN THE YOUNGER OFFICERS WHO PLANNED AND LED COUP—DID WORK THE OVERTHROW OF <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">SHEIKH MUJIB</persName>, AND WE SUSPECT THAT, HAVING TASTED BLOOD, THEY WILL WANT AT THE VERY LEAST TO EXERCISE SOME MEASURE OF INFLUENCE OVER THE COURSE OF EVENTS. WE HAVE NO REASON TO LOOK FOR BANGALEE QUADDAFIS AMONG THE COUP PLANNERS; RATHER, AS MEMBERS OF THE OLD, SERVICE-ORIENTED MIDDLE CLASS WHICH WAS THREATENED BY <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">SHEIKH MUJIB</persName>, THEY MAY PROVE A MORE MODERATE FORCE THAN HAS BEEN SEEN IN EAST BENGAL SINCE PAKISTANI PERIOD.</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>PAGE 04 DACCA 03964 161135Z</p>
                        <p>5. ONE POINT TO BE EMPHASIZED IS THAT, WHILE THE OVERTHROW OF <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">SHEIKH MUJIB</persName> WAS SUCCESSFUL, IF BLOODLY, A GREAT DEAL REMAINS TO BE DONE. <persName corresp="#p_AKM2">MUSHTAQUE</persName>'S SPEECH IS SIGNIFICANT LARGELY FOR ITS GENERALITIES AND ITS ECHOES OF EARLIER AWAMI LEAGUE RHETORIC, BUT CONCRETE ACTIONS HAVE SO FAR BEEN FEW. WE ARE NOT SURPRISED THAT THE DEGREE OF DIRECTION DISPLAYED SO FAR IS LIMITED FOR WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO THINK THAT THOSE PRIVY TO THE PLANNING OF THE COUP WERE SMALL IN NUMBER AND THUS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PREPARING ANY ELABORATE PLANS FOR THE GOVERNACE OF BANGLADESH WAS VERY SMALL. HOWEVER, UNLESS EARLY STEPS ARE TAKEN TO DEMONSTRATE VIGOR AND WILL, THE ADVANTAGE NOW HELD BY THE NEW REGIME WILL BEGIN TO DIMINISH, AN WE MAY CONFRONT AN UNSETTLED—AND UNSETTLING—SITUATION AS CONTENDERS FOR POWER EMERGE. NO ONE NOW ON THE BANGLAEE POLITIICAL STAGE HAS KIND OF COMMANDING PERSONALITY WHICH SUSTAINED <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">SHEIKH MUJIB</persName> FOR SO LONG. THE THE CIVLIAM GOVERNMENT FALTERS, WE MAY FIND THE MILITARY CONCLUDING THAT IS MUST AGAIN SAVE THE NATION.</p>

                        <p>1. IT MAY BE USEFUL TO OFFER A CAPSULE SUMMARY OF THE CHAOTIC EVENTS OF LAST WEEK IN BANGLADESH WHICH SAW THREE DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS, MUCH KILLING, AND THE AVOIDANCE OF CIVIL WAR, WITH ATTENDANT POSSIBILITY OF INDIAN INTER-VENTION, BY THE NARROWEST OF MARGINS. THIS ACCOUNT IS</p>

                        <p>BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE EMBASSY FROM ALL SOURCES.</p>
                        <p>2. THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN BRIGADIER MOSHARRAF, CHIEF OF THE ARMY GENERAL STAFF, WHO HAD BEEN EMBITTERED BY HIS FAILURE TO SHARE IN THE PROMOTIONS RECEIVED BY SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT MUJIB BY THE MAJORS ON AUGUST 15 AND WHO WAS ALSO BELIEVED TO BE ON A LIST OF ARMY OFFICERS TO BE INVESTIGATED WHICH HAD RECENTLY BEEN DRAWN UP BY THE MAJORS, BEGAN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF MONDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 3. WE DO NOT KNOW POSITIVELY WHETHER MOSHARAFF WAS THE ARCHITECT OF THE CONFRONTATION, AS MANY CONTEND, OR WHETHER, AS ONE GOOD SOURCE HAS TOLD TOLD US, HE SIMPLY WENT ALONG WITH SUBORDINATES WHO WERE DETERMINED TO END THE SPECIAL ROLE OF THE MAJORS IN THE MOSHTAQUE GOVERNMENT, A ROLE WHICH HAD RESULTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IN THE HARRASSMENT OF SOME OF THE MILITARY OFFICERS. THIS SOURCE ALSO HELD THAT ONE OF MOSHARRAF'S OBJECTIVES—ALTHOUGH HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY MINDFUL OF THE PERSONAL GLORY THAT MIGHT AWAIT HIM—WAS TO TAKE CONTROL OF HIS SUBORDINATES' PLANS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO AVOID MAJOR BLOODSHED.</p>
                        <p>3. MOSHARRAF AND HIS ALLIES QUICKLY TOOK CONTROL EARLY MONDAY MORNING OF THE ARMY CANTONMENT AS WELL AS MOST OF THE CITY OF DACCA AND PRESSED THEIR CONFRONTATION WITH THE MOSHTAQUE GOVERNMENT BY FLYING A MIG FIGHTER AND ARMED HELICOPTER OVER THE CITY IN A SHOW OF STRENGTH WHICH WAS ALSO INTENDED TO INTIMIDATE THE TANK CREWS LOYAL TO THE GOVERNMENT. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, MOSHARRAF LEVIED FOUR DEMANDS ON MOSHTAQUE: 1) THAT MOSHARRAF REPLACE MAJOR GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_ZR2">ZIAUR RAHMAN</persName>, HIS PERSONAL RIVAL, AS CHIEF OF STAFF; 2) THAT THE MAJORS BE RETURNED TO REGULAR ARMY DISCIPLINE; 3) THAT THE TANK FROCES LOYAL TO THE GOVERNMENT BE DISARMED; AND 4) THAT MOSHTAQUE REMAIN IN OFFICE. OUTGUNNED AND APPARENTLY INTEND ABOVE ALL ON AVOIDING BLOODSHED, WHICH WOULD ALSO HAVE INVITED INDIAN INTERVENTION, MOSHTAQUE EVENTUALLY YIELDED AFTER NEGOTIATING DURING THE COURSE OF A LONG DAY A COMPROMISE WITH MOSHARRAF BY WHICH THE MAJORS AND SOME OF THEIR COLLEAGUES, TO WHOM MOSHTAQUE WAS INDEBTED FOR HIS PRESIDENCY, WERE PERMITTED</p>
                        <p>SECRET</p>
                        <p>SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 03 DACCA 05470 01 OF 02 101306Z</p>
                        <p>TO DEPART BANGLADESH. BEFORE THIS COMPROMISE HAD BEEN REACHED, THE MOSHTAQUE GOVERNMENT HAD CALLED ON THE ARMY FORCES AT COMILLA TO COME TO ITS AID BUT HAD BEEN REFUSED ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE COMILLA COMMANDER WOULD ONLY RESPOND TO THE ORDERS OF THE CHIEF OF ARMY STAFF (WHO WAS THEN UNDER ARREST) OR THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF (I.E., MOSHARRAF).</p>
                        <p>4. THE CONFRONTATION BROUGHT ANOTHER BLOODY RESULT WHICH, WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE, HAD BEEN PART OF AN EARLIER CONTINGENCY PLAN TO BE CARRIED OUT IN THE EVENT THAT MOSHTAQUE WERE TO BE KILLED, I.E., THE MURDER OF HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES IN THE AWAMI PARTY LEADERSHIP WHO WERE NOW HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES—FORMER PRIME MINISTER MANSOOR ALI, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT SYED NAZRUL ISLAM, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, FINANCE MINISTER AND INDIOPHILE TAJUDDIN AHMED, AND FORMER INDUSTRIES MINISTER KAMARUZZAMAN. THESE LEADERS WERE KILLED, EVIDENTLY AT THE ORDER OF ONE OR MORE OF THE MAJORS, EARLY MONDAY MORNING AT DACCA JAIL. THE EVENT ADDED A NOTE OF MYSTERY TO MOSHARRAF'S ACQUIESCENCE LATER IN THE DAY TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE MAJORS, ONE VERSION HAVING IT THAT MOSHARRAF DID NOT YET KNOW OF THE DEED WHEN THE PLANE LEFT DACCA AT MIDNIGHT MONDAY. MANY OBSERVERS ALSO NOTED THAT ONE EFFECT OF THE MURDERS WAS TO REMOVE THE LOGICAL LEADERSHIP OF ANY PRO-INDIAN GOVERNMENT.</p>
                        <p>5. WITH THE EXPLOSIVE SITUATION DEFUSED TO A DEGREE BY THE DEPARTURE OF THE MAJORS, NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN MOSHTAQUE AND MOSHARRAF CONTINUED ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY, RESULTING IN MOSHARRAF'S DESIGNATION AS CHIEF OF STAFF LATE TUESDAY NIGHT, AND EVENTUALLY IN MOSHTAQUE'S RESIGNATION EARLY THURSDAY MORNING WITH THE SIMULTANEOUS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A NON-POLITICAL FIGURE, CHIEF JUSTICE A.S.M. SAYEM, WOULD BE APPOINTED PRESIDENT. <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">SAYEM</persName> WAS SWORN IN ON THURSDAY AND PROMPTLY DISSOLVED THE PARLIAMENT. REPORTS, WHICH WE ACCEPT, WERE RIFE THAT THE CABINET HAD ALREADY RESIGNED IN PROTEST AGAINST THE MURDER OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT LEADERS.</p>
                        <p>6. BUT IT NOW BECAME CLEAR THAT MOSHARRAF'S ASSUMPTION OF POWER IN THE ARMY WAS UNPALATABLE TO MOST OF HIS FELLOW</p>

                        <p>OFFICERS AND ENLISTED RANKS, BOTH BECAUSE GENERAL ZIA EVIDENTLY HELD A MUCH WIDER POPULAR FOLLOWING AMONG THEM BUT ALSO, AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, BECAUSE MOSHARRAF WAS WIDELY SEEN, WHETHER ACCURATELY OR NOT, AS AN INSTRUMENT OF INDIAN POLICY. THIS PERCEPTION WAS BUTTRESSED BY THE PRO-MUJIB PROCESSION ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY'S HARTAL TO PROTEST THE KILLINGS AT DACCA JAIL. THE LOWER RANKS REVOLTED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF FRIDAY MORNING, QUICKLY OVERTHROWING THE MOSHARRAF FORCES AND, ACCORDING TO VIRTUALLY ALL ACCOUNTS, KILLING MOSHARRAF. EXTENSIVE FIRING WENT THROUGHOUT THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND ALL DURING THE DAY FRIDAY, MOST OF IT CELEBRATORY AFTER MOSHARRAF WAS OUESTED. ONE AUTHORITIATIVE SOURCE HAS TOLD US THAT ONLY ABOUT THIRTY WERE KILLED IN THE OVERTHROW; OTHER REPORTS HAVE REACHED US WHICH PUT THE FIGURE IN THE HUNDREDS.</p>
                        <p>7. THE SUCCESSFUL REVOLT OF THE LOWER RANKS NOW BROUGHT A NEW PROBLEM, THE RAMPANT INDISCIPLINE OF THE ENLISTED MEN, MANY OF WHOM NOW TURNED ON OFFICERS AGAINST WHOM THEY MIGHT HAVE GRUDGES AND OTHERS BEGAN PRESENTING DEMANDS ON THE ARMY LEADERSHIP FOR A BETTER DEAL IN THEIR FUTURE TREATMENT. WIDESPREAD REPORTS WERE CURRENT THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITARY OFFICERS HAD FLED OR WERE AT LEAST STAYING AWAY FROM THE CANTONMENT OUT OF FEAR OF THE RAMPAGING SEPOYS, AND SEVERAL REPORTS REACHED US OF THE MURDER OF MILITARY OFFICERS AND OF THEIR WIVES.</p>

MOSHTAQUE WAS OFFERED THE PRESIDENCY ANEW BUT DECLINED ON THE GROUND THAT, IN THE STILL EXPLOSIVE SITUATION, THE COUNTRY REQUIRED A NON-POLITICAL, NON-CONTROVERSIAL PRESIDENT. CONSEQUENTLY THE DECISION WAS REACHED TO KEEP JUSTICE SAYEM IN THE PRESIDENCY AND TO TURN OVER TO HIM AS WELL THE FUNCTIONS OF CHIEF OF THE MARTIAL LAW ADMINISTRATION,</p>

                        <p>A ROLE WHICH HAD BEEN FILLED BRIEFLY BY GENERAL ZIA. WE WERE POINTEDLY ASSURED THAT THESE ARRANGEMENTS ENJOYED FULL SUPPORT BOTH WITHIN THE MILITARY AND WITHIN THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP SO THAT THE WAY WAS NOW CLEAR FOR THE RESTORATION OF STABILITY IN THE COUNTRY.</p>
                        <p>9. AS OF MONDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 10, THE SITUATION HAD RETURNED TO AN APPARENT NORMALCY, WITH INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICE RESUMED ON SUNDAY, BUT THE GENERAL UNEASINESS WAS STILL BEING FED BY REPORTS OF CONTINUED KILLINGS AMONG THE MILITARY AND OF POSSIBLE INDIAN ACTIONS ALONG THE BORDER. THE PROSPECT WAS FOR, AT BEST, A CONTINUED STATE OF TENSION AND UNCERTIANTY.</p>
                        <p>10. COMMENT. THREE CONCLUSIONS IMPLICIT IN THE ABOVE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE UNDERLINE. THE FIRST IS THAT THE ACTIONS OF THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS IN THE COUP AND COUNTER-COUP APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN NON-POLITICAL, EXCEPT IN THE SENSE THAT MOSHARRAF HAD THE ADDITIONAL DISADVANTAGE OF APPEARING TO BE PRO-INDIAN. THE ARMY FORCES WHICH OVERTHREW MOSHTAQUE AND THE MAJORS APPEAR TO HAVE ACTED PRIMARILY OUT OF A SENSE OF GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE MAJORS. THE COUNTER-COUP WAS THE WORK OF LOWER RANKS WHO FAR PREFERRED ZIA TO MOSHARRAF AND WHO WERE ALSO CONCERNED WHRE MOSHARRAF'S LOYALTY MIGHT LIE. WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE REGIMES OF THE PAST WEEK WERE ANTI-AMERICAN, PRO-INDIAN, OR PRO-SOVIET IN CHARACTER.</p>
                        <p>11. THE SECOND IS THATWE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT INDIA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THE WEEK'S ACTIONS.</p>
                        <p>12. THE THIRD IS THE CONFIRMATION OF HOW STRONGLY AND PERVASIVELY ANTI-INDIA ANTIPATHIES ARE FELT HERE-FROM THE TOP OF THE LEADERSHIP TO THE LOWEST GROUPS OF THE SOCIETY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT MOSHARRAF WAS PRO-INDIAN, AND SOME THAT HE WAS NOT, HE WAS WIDELY IDENTIFIED AS SUCH AND THE WILD CELEBRATIONS HERE OF HIS OVERTHROW CARRIED DISTINCTLY ANTI-INDIAN OVERTONES.</p>

                            <item>General ZIA and I wore able to have several minutes of private conversation at a dinner Saturday night. Uppermost on his mind, evidently, was a desire for us to understand that they had registered our concern that a really effective attack on Bangladesh's population problem was long over due. He also sprinkled the conversation with suggestions for further American aid; he evinced some confidence about the prospect for continued calm in the country; shrugged off rumors about any imminent top-level changes in the Government; and reflected the usual <pb n="2" xml:id="d46-02" facs="d46-02"/>apprehension about India but without any sense of immediate concern. END SUMMARY</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>ZIA opened our conversation by referring to the points Senator MCGOVERN had made to him last week about Bangladesh's urgent population problem and said he wanted us to know that they understood this was their top priority. They realized that they could make no real progress in solving their other problems as long as they made no progress in bringing down the rate of population growth. He said they had now designated Sattar, one of their best and most effective people, as the Secretary in charge of population matters and expected this program to get moving. They would also assign more and better people to this work, and would also bring in more women. I said I was pleased to hear this as both here and in Washington during my recent consultation I had been hearing more and more expressions of concern what had been considered, quite frankly, an unsatisfactory record in this area. Questions were being raised about purpose of the enormous amounts of aid we are putting in Bangladesh if there were so little to show in the way of checking the population growth.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Here and there in the conversation the General returned to suggestions about American assistance. At one point asked if we could help meet one of their pressing problems in the education area by making it possible for tem to build <pb n="3" xml:id="d46-03" facs="d46-03"/>recreational facilities at their universities to offer the students some useful channel for their energies when they were not in school, a problem which he thought was serious one in Bangladesh. He hoped we could help them build a complex of swimming pools, gymnasiums, and other facilities for sport and recreation. When I tried to turn this aside by pointing out that it was one thing for us go to the congress for fertilizer, foodgrains and contraceptives but quite another to suggest that we build swimming pools, the General persisted and asked us to consider providing at least the foreign exchange component with them Bangladesh Government taking care of the local taking care of the local currency needs. I told him Mr. Gardiner, Assistant Administrator in AID for Bangladesh and other countries in this area arriving on Sunday and that I would discuss this matter him. He also mentioned that during the MCGOVERN visit he had discussed with the Senator and Charge <persName corresp="#p_CIG1">Cheslaw</persName> the possibility of our providing police training he said he would like to send a group of their police to New York City (where our methods of combating crime would be helpful to Bangladesh's police in dealing with miscreants here—-and also our supplying them with light equipment such as rifle and communications gear for their police. I said I knew this request, which we had conveyed to Washington, but that he would know from our previous conversations that we were <pb n="4" xml:id="d46-04" facs="d46-04"/>primarily interested in using our resources to help them in agricultural development, and family planning the crucial areas where we could help best. I said in this connection that we were working right now on the question of the further foodgrain deliveries we would make for the rest of the year. We also discussed the recent request (DACCA's 0300) for $50 million in budget support and I suggested to General ZIA that he should not be optimistic about this possibility. I told him that I understood he had also suggested that we should have a military attache in the Embassy; I said that this matter was under review and that perhaps I would have something more to say about it before long.</item>

                            <item>(With respect to General ZIA's request for police training and equipment, British High Commissioner Smallman told me on Sunday that ZIA also raised this question with him at the same dinner, pursuing lower level requests which the British had already received from the <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss>. Smallman says he told ZIA that there might be a possibility of the British doing something about training but discouraged him from thinking that the British would be able to provide any further communications equipment beyond that which had supplied under an earlier program. He said they were also under pressure from Commodore <persName>Khan</persName> for naval aid but that he had told the Commodore that any such aid would have to be on a sales basis.)</item>

                            <item>ZIA made the inevitable critical reference to India but did not dwell on the subject or show acute concern about the present state of relations acknowledging in fact that they were now a little better than they had been. He said it was surprising how much objectionable material about Bangladesh was printed in the Indian press and also surprising how this could happen under the emergency powers there. He referred to the robbing of a Hindu temple (the Indian High Commissioner had mentioned this same case to me earlier in the week) and said the Indians had made a fuss about it. When they had looked into it they had found that the temple had been looted by seven thieves, four of whom were Moslem and three of whom were Hindu, so that it was just a case of ordinary thievery of the kind they were always running into. He said that in fact they had had not one single real incident of communal difficulties since the change in Government. I commented that this was obviously a crucial issue for New Delhi and we had been pleased to see the special concern shown for it here.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>With respect to his domestic affairs, ZIA made the points that he had been trying to bring about more decentralization of government, to encourage the work of private enterprise, and to continue to hold smuggling under more effective control. In answer to my questions, ZIA expressed confidence about the outlook for <pb n="6" xml:id="d46-06" facs="d46-06"/>continued calm the country and said that discipline in the armed forces was not a problem at present. When I mentioned that I had heard rumors that important changes might be about to take place at the top, he said these rumors had been circulating for a month now and shrugged them off. (The rumors we have beard in the last few days have it that President <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">Sayem</persName> has resigned with an early effective date and that former Chief Justice <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> will become President.)</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>COMMENT. This was, in view of my home leave, my first meeting with ZIA since his emergence as the man effectively in charge of Bangladesh. I found him as relaxed, softspoken, and friendly as ever and showing no signs of strain under his new responsibilities. He looks and acts, if anything, as though he is enjoying being in charge. His almost naive approach to the possibilities of American aid area reminder, however, that he has — quite understandably in view of his youth and background — some limitations of perspective. I told him that I would like to bring in Assistant AID Administrator Gardiner to see him this week, which he readily agreed to, so we should have occasion later this week to report further on his views.</item>

                        <p>SUMMARY. Bangladesh is presently in a State of Emergency and under Martial Law. The Government possesses extraordinary powers and there are no effective legal guarantees for the protection of human rights. However, the Martial Law Administration (<gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss>) officially considers itself a temporary regime whose role is to restore stability, law and order, and equal justice to the country as a prelude to the restoration of representative government. On this basis, the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> justifies the continued ban on political activities and on criticism of its actions. The <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> does not encourage or condone torture or inhuman punishment or degrading treatment or punishment although there continue to be occasional reports of rough interrogative techniques, thus raising doubts that all levels of government are sufficiently sensitive to this issue. Regarding prolonged <pb n="2" xml:id="d47-02" facs="d47-02"/>detention without charges, both the previous government of MOSHTAQUE Ahmed and the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> have together released about 2000 political prisoners jailed in the era of <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</persName>. However, the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> itself has used vague charges of “prejudicial activities” to jail some political figures, none of whom has as yet been brought to trial and whose detention may prove to be prolonged. On balance, the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss>'s use of its vast powers has been limited. But the very existence of Emergency and Martial Laws and the lack of adequate legal recourse against their abuse has meant that the citizens of Bangladesh are treading warily and few give the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> cause to invoke its powers. END SUMMARY.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The citizens of Bangladesh lost virtually all guarantee of their fundamental rights in a series of government actions which were described in detail in references B and C. Briefly, these actions were:

                                <item>A Special Powers Act (SPA) which makes most criticisms of the government liable to interpretation as “prejudicial acts” against the state and which gives the government extensive powers of arrest and detention;</item>
                                <label>(B)</label>
                                <item>A State of Emergency which suspends fundamental rights and subsequent Emergency Powers Rules (EPR) which remove most checks on the powers of arrest and detention;</item>
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d47-03" facs="d47-03"/>

                                <item>A constitutional amendment which established a one-party state under a strongly authoritarian president and removed from the Supreme Court its jurisdiction over the protection of fundamental rights.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>All of these restrictive acts are still in effect; added to them is Martial Law declared by Moshtaque Ahmed after the August 1975 coup against <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</persName> and continued and expanded by President and Chief Martial Law Administrator A.S.M. Sayer following the coup and countercoup of the following November. The Martial Law Regulations (MLR) reiterate many of the repressive features of the Special Powers Act (SPA) and the Emergency Power Rules (EPR) and add some further restrictions on the human rights of Bangladeshis.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Bangladesh is currently both in a State of Emergency and under Martial Law. The State of Emergency was declared on the basis of Article 141 A of the Constitution which states that the President may issue a proclamation of Emergency “if he is satisfied that a grave emergency exists in which the security or economic life of Bangladesh… is threatened by war or external aggression or internal disturbance.” There is no constitutional justification for a state of Martial Law. Some local lawyers, however, have remarked that there is a judicial <pb n="4" xml:id="d47-04" facs="d47-04"/>precedent from the Pakistan era for the acceptance of the legitimacy of a de facto martial law regime. To the SPA and the EPR, Martial Law Regulations (MLR) have added these further restrictions on ordinary legal guarantees;
<list>
                                <item>--No MLR or any action taken by the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> can be called into question or declared illegal or void by any court, tribunal or authority;</item>
                                <item>--Most decisions of the Special and Summary Martial Law courts cannot be appealed;</item>
                                <item>--Review of Martial Law Court decisions rests with the Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrators, not with the judiciary (the president, however, must approve death sentences);</item>
                                <item>— In the Martial Law Courts, lawyers cannot function as advocates and plead cases; they may serve only as advisors to the defendants.</item>
                            </list>

                        </p>
                        <p>3. Despite its sweeping powers, the government does not think its citizens are without basic rights. President <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">Sayem</persName> (the former Chief Justice) emphasizes due process of law, the efforts of the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> to restore the independence and integrity of the judiciary and the civil service, and the need to return to representative government. <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">Sayem</persName>'s special assistant, retired Justice Abdus Sattar, moreover, has publicly said that “The rule of law that has been <pb n="5" xml:id="d47-05" facs="d47-05"/>enshrined in our constitution guarantees the fundamental rights as have been enumerated in most of the thirty articles of the Declaration of Human Rights.” There is little question that, as a government, the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> recognizes most of these human rights. Nevertheless, constitutional provisions and government intentions notwithstanding, the continuing state of Emergency and the Martial Law place the following restrictions on human rights:

                        <p>4. Although public reporting on the hearings is limited, the Special and Summary Martial Law Courts appear to be <pb n="6" xml:id="d47-06" facs="d47-06"/>rendering verdicts based upon the evidence presented. There have been acquittals not only of minor figures but also of some prominent politicians, and we have heard no one criticize the summary court proceedings for partiality. Overzealousness can perhaps be attributed to the prosecution but not to the courts. The Draconian punishments permitted by the MLR have not been applied often; one ex-Minister, Abdus Samad, was sentenced to life imprisonment as an “exemplary” measure because he was convicted of abusing his high position to gain property. The only death sentence publicly announced was against two men for embezzlement of large amounts of cotton yarn during a period was when there was a severe cloth shortage in the country. Moreover, the regular courts have heard appeals filed against the government for illegal detention, and several of the accused were either granted bail or released entirely. Lawyers for Gazi Golam Mostaffa, former Red Cross Chief, attempted to raise the issue of double jeopardy. The government had brought before a Martial Law Court what was generally considered a weak case against Gazi for abuse of power and corruption; before the verdict was announced the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> filed two more cases against him on the same charge. His lawyers who argued to the Supreme Court that Gazi could be tried only once on the charge apparently lost their appeal because Gazi was subsequently <pb n="7" xml:id="d47-07" facs="d47-07"/>convicted in two of the cases and acquitted in one, but the appeal postponed the proceedings for more than a month.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> has made some gestures toward the restoration of equal justice. It repealed the Collaborators Act by which thousands of citizens were incarcerated and deprived of certain civil rights for alleged collaboration with the Pakistani army in 1971. It has also restored to civil servants the right of appeal in dismissal cases. It has restored citizenship to a number of Bangalees from whom it was arbitrarily removed and has announced that citizenship henceforth is to be determined only by law. It has also repealed the Abandoned Property Act and begun restoring property to Bangladeshis who lost it principally for political reasons.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">DETENTION</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. Both post-August governments have released political prisoners. In October, the government decided to release “unconditionally” all purely political prisoners and set up a review board to study the cases of political leaders and workers, against whom specific charges were lodged. Under the “unconditional” category, MOSHTAQUE released one thousand prisoners. The <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> has continued this policy and to date has released another 958 people following review of their cases, although there are complaints from <pb n="8" xml:id="d47-08" facs="d47-08"/>the radical left that the process is too slow and all anti-Mujib detenus should be released. The Martial Law Courts have also begun clearing the backlog of cases against defendants who have been in detention, some since 1972, on various charges such as illegal arms holding and smuggling.</p>
                        <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss>'s record regarding detention, however, is not spotless because it shares the anxiety of its predecessor regimes about the issues of national security and what constitutes permissible political activity. The <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> has itself been arresting political figures, using not only the MLR but also the SPA and the EPR as justification. The first to be arrested were the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) leaders for anti-state activity in November after they had taken credit for the Sepoy mutiny and were seen to be stirring up more trouble. In the following month, in apparent dragnets to recover illegal arms, more than a hundred political workers of the JSD and some from MUJIB's Awami League were arrested. Since then there have been the announced arrests for pre-judicial activities of more than a dozen politicians of the Awami League, NAP/Muzaffar, the CPB, and the JSD. Prosecutions against the major Awami League politicians arrested in August have been moving slowly, in large part we hear because the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> has keen having difficulty <pb n="9" xml:id="d47-09" facs="d47-09"/>collecting evidence that will stand up in court. Since the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> is only five months old and has been using its powers in a limited fashion, it is not possible to determine to what extent it will use prolonged detention to control political activities it considers threatening. However, its preoccupation with security is so similar to that of MUJIB's and MOSHTAQUE's governments and the arrests it has made to date of somewhat the same pattern that we would expect that prolonged detention may result and the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> will risk bringing cases to court only when it believes it has sufficient evidence for convictions.</p>

                        <p>8. There is no evidence that the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> either encourages or condones torture, degrading treatment or killing. As we noted in reference C, however, rough handling is not an unusual interrogative technique in the subcontinent. One still hears the occasional story of police or military attempting to dispose of the remains of a detenu who succumbed to questioning. While there is no record of any security personnel being sentenced to jail for ill treating prisoners, one of the main concerns of the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> is restoring discipline to and upgrading the calibre of the police force which has been both demoralized and corrupted since independence. In recognition that a problem exists, <pb n="10" xml:id="d47-10" facs="d47-10"/>the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> passed a regulation making it a crime to coerce or intimidate citizens through abuse of police powers. The courts also may be taking a harsher attitude toward such abuses; one defendant was released because the judge ruled that the police had obtained evidence through unjustified use of force.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> considers that its extraordinary powers are temporary and necessary to the restoration of stability, law and order, and respect for law. It prides itself upon an even-handed application of justice. We have found the most effective way to convey our concerns regarding human rights is to repeatedly raise with members of government and others of influence the issues of renewed political activity and the restoration of representative government, the validity of criminal charges brought against politicians, the grounds upon which others are detained for prolonged periods, and then fairness of the Martial Law Courts and the citizen's right of appeal to higher authority.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">CONCLUSION</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. The Martial Law Administration presents itself as a non-political and neutral interim Government which eschews favoritism and uses its extraordinary powers with restraint to correct past abuses and instill a respect for law. Nevertheless, the human rights of Bangladesh are protected <pb n="11" xml:id="d47-11" facs="d47-11"/>only by the largesse of the government, not by enforceable legal guarantees. Should the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> choose to use its extensive repressive powers, there are no legal impediments. So far, the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> has managed to avoid the accusation of unequal application of justice with one exception — the exercise of political rights. Inevitably perhaps, adherents of the regime of <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</persName> and of the JSD which challenged the authority of the army appear to have less scope for political expression than that permitted other groups. Once again, the issue comes down to one man's freedom of expression being another man's sedition. Attempts at expressing unpopular views, however, have been limited. Bangladeshis are fully aware of the powers of the <gloss target="#t_MLA1">MLA</gloss> and are treading warily. Few give the government cause to invoke its repressive measures.</p>

                        <p>As the result of the damage done in December, 1972, and January, 1973, to four United States Information Service Centers in Bangladesh, the United States Government (Embassy Note No. 010 of March 13, 1973) requested compensation in the amount of $128,804.72 from the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>The Bangladesh Government agreed to pay this amount in a Note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (No. AP (US)-<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>/5/73) date May 2, 1973. On October 24, 1973, a partial payment equivalent to $27,305.04 was made to the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>In view of the long period that has passed without further payment, the Embassy wishes to remind the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of this outstanding debt and requests that the remaining amount be paid as soon as possible.

A.I.D. SUPPORT IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WOULD BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL BECAUSE PORT AND RAILWAYS BOTTLENECKS ARE SLOWING DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE, THE ADMIRAL NOTED THAT BDG HAS PREPARED A NUMBER OF PROJECTS FOR DONOR CONSIDERATION AND THAT PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION CELLS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN EACH MINISTRY. <pb n="2" xml:id="d50-02" facs="d50-02"/>UNFORTUNATELY MUCH TIME IS NOW LOST BECAUSE EACH DONOR REQUIRES EXTENSIVE FEASIBILITY STUDIES PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING ITS ASSISTANCE.</item>

(GARDINER SAID WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CONSIDER ASSISTANCE TO RURAL ROADS IN AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT.) ACKNOWLEDGING PROBLEMS WHICH RESULT FROM NECESSITY OF RESPONDING TO DIVERSE DONOR PRACTICES AND CONCERNS, PARKER ASKED THE ADMIRAL IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR A.I.D. TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN SYSTEMS ANALYSIS PARKER OFFERED TO MAKE AVAILABLE AN NAS STUDY OF HOW SYSTEMS ANALYSIS CAN BE APPLIED TO LDC ADMINSTRATIVE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS. PARKER ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE FIXED AMOUNT REIMBURSMENT APPROACH, BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON STANDARDIZED DESIGN CRITERIA, MIGHT BE MORE WIDELY UTILIZED TO SPEED PROJECT EXECUTION AND REDUCE NEED FOR EXTENSIVE FEASIBILITY WORK.</item>

                                    <item>--RAILWAYS ARE NOT PROGRAM AREA WE CAN ADDRESS UNDER OUR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE. WE RECOGNIZE HOWEVER THAT BANGLADESH HAS SERIOUS TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION NEEDS AND WE WOULD BE WILLING TO SUPPORT A SPECIAL MEETING IN DACCA OF AID GROUP TO ADDRESS THIS SECTOR IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO FUND PROJECTS IN THIS SECTOR BUT THROUGH PROCESS OF DONOR COORDINATION WHICH COULD RESULT FROM SUCH A MEETING WE MAY BE ABLE TO RELEASE OTHER DONOR FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION AREA BY SUBSTITUTIONG A.I.D.

PARKER EXPLAINED THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR AID TO CONSIDER PROVIDING ASSISTANCE FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF HELICOPTERS BECAUSE OF STRONG ADVERSE CONGRESSIONAL FEELING IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER WHICH WOULD REQUIRE HELICOPTERS: (1) HE HAS ASKED U.S. NAVY TO REVIEW ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE HELICOPTERS DURING THE JULY-SEPTEMBER MONSOON PERIOD WHEN FLOODING IS MOST LIKELY TO STRIKE; (2) A.I.D. WOULD BE WILLING TO ASSIST BANGLADESH IN SECURING SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS FOR PACKAGE SUPPLY OF HELICOPTERS, PILOTS, AND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT.

                            <item>Conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">M. R. Siddiqi</persName>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The following points of interest came out of a conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">M.R. Siddiqi</persName> at my house on August 30, 1976. <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName>, as usual, was surprisingly candid and not particularly restrained by considerations of his Government's policy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> said he was under instructions to call at the Department on his return to Washington to seek our support for Bangladesh's case at the U.N. against India on the issue of the division of the Ganges waters. He said he expected to return to Washington about September 5. <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> noted that he did not agree with his instructions. He said he didn't understand what India — which clearly had been taking more water than they needed to — was up to, but he also didn't fully understand what his own Government was up to. He pointed out that Bangladesh ran the risk of being defeated on this issue at the U.N., which would be a terrible set-back. And even if they weren't defeated, he did not see what utility there would be in the kind of annual conversation about this issue which would presumably take place at the U.N. Musing about the hard line on India, he said it had been curious that up until May of this year ZIA personally had been very careful not to criticize India but all this had changed after May. (For what it's worth, the first round of Indian-<gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> technical talks on Farakka ended in obvious failure on May 2.)</p>
                        <p>I told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> of my disappointment that I would be leaving Bangladesh with nothing tangible in the matter of compensation for American companies who had claims here, and emphasized the state of frustration we had reached. After a brief discussion in which he mentioned that Mujib had told him shortly before his death and <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName>'s own departure for Washington that he had given instructions that the “two” American claims should be paid — <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> said he could not remember the names of <pb n="2" xml:id="d51-02" facs="d51-02"/>these two companies and did not know what had happened to this “decision” by Mujib — he asked me for a paper summarizing the insurance companies' problem (he was familiar with the other aspects) so that he could take it up with General ZIA when he saw him later this week. He mentioned that his No. 2 in Washington had tried to reach him by phone while he was in Chittagong about conversations he had had with the Department on these matters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> said they were very happy with Admiral <persName>Khan</persName>'s visit to Washington, particularly with the fact that the Secretary had finally received the Admiral (<persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> gave Senator Percy the credit for getting the appointment arranged). <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> said that the American humanitarian interest in Bangladesh had always been clear, but now they were persuaded that we also took an interest in their sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>After we had discussed the gradual improvement that had taken place in Bangladesh-American relations over the past several years, I asked <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> if, in his view, there were any omissions in our policy, apart from their desire for greater aid. He surprised me by saying that he did not think they needed more aid. He said their problem really was one of making use of existing availabilities, and noted that new donors from the Middle East were also coming in which added to this aspect of the problem. He said that if the weather stayed good and there were another excellent harvest this fall, it might even be that Bangladesh would not need food next year. This would cause a great dilemma, however, because Bangladesh needed the proceeds from the sale of our grain for its own budget.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the domestic political scene, <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> said he would not be surprised if the parties competing in the elections next year were not almost exactly the same ones that had been active previously. He said that up until a month or so ago, everyone assumed that the Awami League was a totally discredited party. Now, it looked like they would be the strongest of all the groups, partly because they were the only ones with a really effective organization to draw upon. He dismissed former President Moshtaque Ahmed's chances as minimal; he said MOSHTAQUE had felt originally that he would head up a “cocktail” of various Islamic and rightist elements of other parties, including the Awami League. But he had failed in his bid for support in the Awami League and so the others were also not <pb n="3" xml:id="d51-03" facs="d51-03"/>enthusiastic about joining him. He said he didn't think MOSHTAQUE realized how weak his position had proved to be but there was no question in his (<persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName>'s) mind that it was very weak indeed. He said that <persName>Khan</persName> Sabur was a very popular figure but had no organizational strength; if he had a year or so to prepare he might be able to do something but not by next February. To my question whether General ZIA could be expected to retire from his position as the man in charge of Bangladesh and go back to the barracks, Siddiqi said he simply didn't know, but that experience in this part of the world with military governments did not suggest that this happened very often.</p>
                        <p>When I asked <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> how long he expected to be in Washington, he said that since his contract was for three years he expected he would be there for another two years. He said he was enjoying his stay in Washington immensely, and that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> was as well.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">Siddiqi</persName> should, of course, be strictly protected with respect to some of his unorthodox views.</p>

RESPONSE CAME IN COURSE OF MEETINGS BETWEEN UNDER SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName> AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName> AND AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName> HERE OCTOBER 5, AND BETWEEN THEM AND DCMLA.

                            <item>THE MEETING BETWEEN <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName> AND <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName> WAS ARRANGED AT LATTER'S REQUEST AS A “COURTESY” CALL. IN ADDITION TO FARAKKA AND ARMS POLICY, IT WAS APPARENT, AS BD MINISTER KUMAYUN KABIR HAD EARLIER IMPLIED TO US, THAT <pb n="2" xml:id="d52-02" facs="d52-02"/>
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName> WAS INTERESTED IN SETTING UP A MEETING BETWEEN VISITING DCMLA VICE ADMIRAL M.R. KHAN AND THE SECRETARY TO DISCUSS THESE SUBJECTS. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName> TOLD <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName> THAT THE SECRETARY WOULD BE UNAVAILABLE BUT OFFERED INSTEAD TO CALL ALONG WITH <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName> ON <persName>KHAN</persName> IN NEW YORK THE FOLLOWING DAY. <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName> ACCEPTED THE OFFER.</item>

                            <item>IN FIRST MEETING, <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName> RAISED SUBJECT OF ARMS POLICY BY REFERRING TO OUTSTANDING REQUEST FOR MILITARY EQUIPMENT WHICH <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> THINKS WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF BILLION DOLLARS. (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> ESTIMATED <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss>'S AUGUST REQUEST LIST WOULD COST FROM SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO ONE AND ONE HALF BILLION.) HE SAID THAT BDG HOPES THAT MOST ITEMS ON LIST, SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT, CAN BE PROVIDED AS MILITARY SURPLUS. <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName> STRESSED MAJOR ROLE THAT ARMY PLAYS IN MAINTENANCE OF BD STABILITY AND CONSEQUENT NEED FOR SUCH EQUIPMENT.</item>

HE POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY LITTLE OR NO SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE AND ASKED IF THE <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> IS SEEKING CREDITOR CASH PURCHASES. HE NOTED PROBABLE CONGRESSIONAL OBJECTIONS TO ANY CREDIT SALES AND POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, EVEN IF WE WERE TO COUCH REQUESTS IN TERMS OF MEETING BD'S INTERNAL SECURITY NEEDS.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>UNDER SECRETARY RULED SALE OF SOPHISTICATED ARMS SUCH AS F-4'S OR F-5'S AS OUT OF THE QUESTION. HE TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT WE WOULD BE PREPARED TO LICENSE THE EXPORT OF NON-LETHAL ITEMS AND THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER LETHAL EQUIPMENT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName> ASKED THAT THE <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> PREPARE A PRIORITY LIST OF NON-LETHAL ITEMS AND INDICATE HOW MUCH IT EXPECTED TO OBTAIN FOR CASH AND HOW MUCH THROUGH CREDIT.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>DURING SUBSEQUENT MEETING WITH ADMIRAL <persName>KHAN</persName>, AFTER CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION OF FARAKKA, <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName> REVIEWED HIS CONVERSATION ON ARMS POLICY WITH <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName>, NOTING OUR INHIBITIONS ON PROVISION OF LETHAL ITEMS BUT OUR WILINGNESS TO CONSIDER THEN ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. HE NOTED UNDERSTANDING WITH <persName corresp="#p_SMR1">SIDDIQI</persName> THAT BANGLADESH WILL FURNISH <pb n="3" xml:id="d52-03" facs="d52-03"/>US A LIST OF NONLETHAL EQUIPMENT NEEDS, RANKED IN PRIORITY ORDER, AND SAID WE UNDERSTAND BANGLADESH CONSIDERS COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT TO BE MOST IMPORTANT. ON RECEIPT OF SUCH A LIST, UNDER SECRETARY TOLD <persName>KHAN</persName> WE WILL LOOK AT P AND A DATA AND TERMS, BUT <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF GRANT AID AND THAT WE HAVE STRONG INHIBITIONS REGARDING CREDIT. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName> DESCRIBED BANGLADESH'S AUGUST LIST AS TOO BROAD AND UNCLEAR AND DIFFICULT TO HANDLE WITH INCLUSION OF ITEMS SUCH AS FIGHTER AIRCRAFT.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>IN RESPONSE TO <persName>KHAN</persName>'S REQUEST THAT <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> REPRESENTATIVES GO TO DACCA TO DISCUSS WHAT MATERIAL WE CAN PROVIDE, HABIB SUGGESTED THAT <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> SIMPLY FURNISH US WITH A NEW LIST TO CLARIFY ITS NEEDS WHICH WE CAN CONSIDER HERE. HE STRESSED THE VERY LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF SURPLUS EQUIPMENT BUT LEFT THE DOOR OPEN ON LANDING CRAFT WHICH ARE OCCASIONALLY AVAILABLE. IN DISCUSSION OF TERM “LETHAL,” UNDER SECRETARY MADE CLEAR THAT SMALL ARMS AS WELL AS MORE SOPHISTICATED ITEMS ARE SO CONSIDERED AND BE NOTED THE PROBABILITY OF BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL CRITICISM SHOULD WE PROVIDE LETHAL ARMS. LIKEWISE, PROVISION OF ANY FORM OF CREDIT TERNS WOULD PUT IN JEOPARDY WITH CONGRESS OUR ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName> SAID. <persName>KHAN</persName> AGREED THAT THAT PROGRAM IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO BANGLADESH.</item>

According to Attygalle, both Minister of Fisheries George Rajapakse and Minister of Industries T.B. Subasinghe (both left wing members SLFP) have been pressing <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> to approve proposed Soviet fisheries agreement and for permission send officers of both ministries to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for training. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, Attygalle said, has been adverse to training Ceylonese in Soviet Union and thus far has withstood pressure by citing Sri Lanka's non-alignment policy.

According Attygalle, Mendis went on to say <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> concerned that her effort to support US at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on terrorism issue had QUOTE backfired UNQUOTE and did not want decision on military training to give more concern. She had decided, however, it would be unwise to reveal officially to Ambassador extent of internal Cabinet difficulties.

                            <item>COMMENT: Adverse decision appears reflect <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>'s continuing suspicion of Soviet motives and activities in Sri Lanka and should not be interpreted as change in her attitude toward US. Air Commodore Paddy Mendis explained to DATT that extended discussions between MDFA and <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> centered around search for acceptable alternatives that would allow US training without forcing <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> to take Soviet training as well. These included paying for training — too expensive; paying for only one or two courses — unacceptable to SLAF; and asking <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to provide under non-military label— infeasible. With none of alternatives acceptable, decision made to postpone issue.</item>

Government has not carried through, now recognizing that many of promised measures would contribute to economic disorder.

Scattered insurgent bands, probably no more than 400 individuals, still exist, leaders are now on trial, and between 3,000 and 5,000 participants are still in prison. Insurrection seems to have been unique event, unlikely to be repeated here and unlikely carry lesson for elsewhere. It has had continuing disruptive effect, however, of heightening internal pressures in all established parties, often along lines of “generation gap.” Younger, more radical members of these parties have found sympathizers in own <pb n="4" xml:id="d55-04" facs="d55-04"/>age group across party lines and clash with older politicians in respective parties who no longer are considered proponents of true line.

                            <item>Economic situation: Sri Lanka's economy has long been troubled by combination of domestic and international forces that have imposed rigorous constraints on growth. Continuing balance of payments and recurrent budgetary deficits have contributed to prolonged economic crisis and severely limited scope for new initiatives. One example of hardships caused by external factors is expected increase of $46 million in major food imports bill alone this year because of rise in world prices. Situation further complicated by mounting unemployment and rising domestic price levels.</item>

Because of steep political price GSL considers it would have to pay, however, it has taken only limited action, and that reluctantly. <pb n="5" xml:id="d55-05" facs="d55-05"/>First <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> budget (1970) did reduce marginally the rate of increase on social welfare expenditures but increased overall spending sharply and measures which acted as severe disincentive to private sector expansion and investment. As result, GNP growth rate was only .9 percent in 1971 and 2.5 percent in 1972. Overall picture remains generally bleak, although there has been some revival of private investment and some commendable reforms have been introduced by Government despite considerable political risk, such as subsidy cuts affecting flour, sugar, petroleum products and textiles. However, any significant capital expenditure for public investment and foreign exchange requirements will continue to depend heavily on foreign assistance.</item>

Sri Lanka military can probably handle any indigenous threat if no outside assistance in training and arms is given to potential insurgents. Foreign military influence is primarily from Commonwealth, with increased training in Asian states. Prime Minister apparently wishes avoid military training abroad by big powers and therefore utilizes “special relationship” with Commonwealth nations for Sri Lanka's needs.</item>

One manifestation of new footing was silence which <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> maintained throughout crucial period of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s efforts wind down Viet-Nam war last December. Another is tacit virtual abandonment of non-nuclear declaration policy; U.S. Navy ships and U.S. military aircraft can visit Sri Lanka despite <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> espousal of Indian Ocean Peace Zone. While U.S. -Sri Lanka relations are thus markedly better than when Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>'s Government took office in 1970 (when Peace Corps was terminated, Asia Foundation ousted, and Communist regimes recognized), continuation of U.S. aid will probably be significant element in maintenance current good state.</item>

                            <item>Reply to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> on Aid to Sri Lanka</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> writes to you every year well in advance of the annual World Bank Aid Group meeting for Sri Lanka urging the US make a substantial pledge. She did so again this year [Tab B].</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> annually describes in detail steps Sri Lanka has taken to provide a sound framework for economic development. The problem in our view and that of other consortium members is that these steps have not produced the results necessary to establish a sound framework for economic assistance. In recent years our aid has taken the form of food assistance—last year $10 million—which the government converts into support and it was deeply appreciated. Sri Lanka would be eligible for development loans if its government policies could justify them, but thus far this has been difficult.</p>
                        <p>As in the past, a US position consistent with our own limitations was presented at the Aid Group meeting recently held in Paris—a range of $15-18 million for Sri Lanka in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 74. State has noted that this statement of intention was carefully made subject to budget and supply availabilities which have been affected by the current uncertainty of food grain supplies and prices.</p>
                        <p>Our action in Paris was essentially the response to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>'s letter, but a short, sympathetic reply from you now would be consistent with our good bilateral relations, expressing the intention to do all possible to carry through.</p>
                        <p>The suggested reply at Tab A avoids committing you to a specific figure and does not refer explicitly to the $15-18 million (although it is presently anticipated we will be able to meet this commitment) but alludes generally to the position taken in Paris. The warm tone is a reflection of the fact that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> has enjoyed the relationship with you ever since her meeting here in October 1971.</p>

                            <p>Thank you for writing to me in connection with the Aid Group meeting for Sri Lanka. I have appreciated the opportunity to have your personal report on measures taken to enhance Sri Lanka's economic development. Some of these, I know, may not have been easy decisions for you.</p>
                            <p>I want personally to reaffirm our sympathetic understanding of the problems which you face in this regard and to assure you of our desire to be as helpful as possible within the limits of our available resources. As you know, we hope to provide additional food assistance during our Fiscal Year 1974 as described by my representative at the Aid Group meeting in Paris. Wheat supply and budgetary availabilities may affect the actual quantity and dollar level reached because of the uncertainty of pressures on the world's supply of food grains, but I am confident that you understand these problems.</p>
                            <p>The skill and courage with which you are facing a very trying situation are greatly admired here.</p>
                            <p>The intention of my Government is to support to the extent we are able your efforts to promote the independence and well being of the people of Sri Lanka.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> BUDGET CONSTRAINTS LED TO DECISION IN FEBRUARY 1972 TO REDUCE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY US ARMY AT KAGNEW STATION, ASMARA, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION IN BOTH PERSONNEL AND FUNCTIONS AT THAT STATION. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS REDUCTION, AND BASED ON CONTINUING BUDGET RESTRICTIONS, US NAVY HAS REASSESSED ITS COMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS THROUGHOUT INDIAN OCEAN/RED SEA AREA IN ORDER TO DETERMINE POSSIBILITIES AND DESIRABILITY OF CONSOLIDATING NAVY COMMUNICATIONS IN THAT AREA. NAVY STUDIES INDICATED THAT MOST PRACTICAL SOLUTION WOULD BE TO CONSOLIDATE NAVY'S TACTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AT DIEGO GARCIA AND TO PHASE OUT ITS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY AT KAGNEW. WE HAVE INFORMED THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT THAT OUR PRESENCE AT KAGNEW IS UNDER REVIEW. FINAL DECISION WILL NOT BE MADE UNTIL THE REVIEW IS COMPLETED. IF DECISION IS MADE TO MOVE, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> WOULD DESIRE TO COMPLETE THE ENLARGMENT OF THE DIEGO FACILITY END OF <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76. DIEGO GARCIA EXPANSION WOULD RESTORE COMMUNICATIONS COVERAGE IN GULF OF OMAN, ARABIAN SEA, AND WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN, WHERE KAGNEW PHASEOUT WOULD HAVE CAUSED TEMPORARY DEGRADATION. MOVE TO DIEGO GARCIA WOULD INVOLVE CONSIDERABLE ANNUAL DOLLAR SAVINGS, AND WOULD MOVE IMPORTANT COMMUNICATIONS LINKS TO FAR LESS POLITICALLY VULNERABLE LOCATION.</item>

It was repeated to Islamabad, London, Moscow, New Delhi, and Tehran. Pakistan's continuing threats to leave the alliance because of its inaction during the 1971 war with India occupied much of agenda in Tehran. In telegram 5319 the Embassy discussed a subsequent meeting on July 2 between Deputy Chief of Mission Sydney Sober and Pakistani Minister of State for Defense and Foreign Affairs <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>, who asserted that the threat to Pakistan from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not direct, but continued to come from India. Thus, if the United States did not reconsider its refusal to give military aid to Pakistan, Islamabad would “probably not” remain part of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>2.

HIS DESCRIPTION OF <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> “ SOUL- SEARCHING” ON DECISION WHETHER TO REMAIN IN <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> SEEMED STRONG INDICATION PAKISTAN SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING LEAVING ALLIANCE UNLESS, OF COURSE, OTHER PART-</p>

                        <p>NERS REVISED VIEWS OF <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>' S ROLE. HE CONCEDED VALUE OF <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> AS FORUM, AS CATALYST FOR RCD, AND SOURCE OF OTHER DEVELOPMENT AID, AND AS “FACTOR” IN RELATIONS WITH NON-REGIONAL MEMBERS. WHY NOT, HE ASKED, ABOLISH “MILITARY WING” OF <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, WHICH IS ONLY “ PROVOCATIVE” AND DOES NOTHING. MAKE <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> AN ECONOMIC/ POLITICAL GROUPING FOR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.</p>
                        <p>3. SECRETARY ROGERS REPLIED THAT HE FOUND THIS DISCUSSION VERY USEFUL; IT REVEALS WHAT WAS ON EACH MEMBERS' MIND IN THIS VERY FRANK EXCHANGE. HE SAID HE COULD UNDERSTAND PAK MINISTER' S CONCERN, BUT ASKED THAT HE LOOK AT THIS ORGANIZATION AND OUR RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN FROM US POINT OF VIEW. ONE VALUE OF THE ORGANIZATION WAS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.</p>
                        <p>4. SECRETARY POINTED OUT PAK MINISTER ADMITTED <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> PLAYED ROLE IN PREVENTING MAJOR POWER CONFLICT IN AJA, ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT RPT NOT COME BACK TO THIS POINT IN REST OF HIS EXPLANATION. BUT IT IS TRUE, AND IF THERE WERE NO <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, PAKISTAN MIGHT NOT RPT NOT HAVE ITS PRESENT TROUBLES. PAKISTAN MIGHT NOT RPT NOT EXIST. THE KIND OF ALLIANCES BEING DISCUSSED HAVE PREVENTED WORLD WAR III, THE ULTIMATE HORROR. ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT, SECSTATE ASKED, OF UTMOST RPT UTMOST IMPORTANCE?</p>
                        <p>5. SECRETARY REITERATED: OUR ROLE IN <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> MUST BE PART OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ALLIANCE MEMBERS. SUCH AN ALLIANCE WAS NEVER INTENDED TO PREVENT REGIONAL CONFLICT. IMPORTANT POINT IS ALLIANCE PREVENTED WW III AS US FOUGHT TWO WARS.</p>
                        <p>6. ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN ALLIANCES DOES RPT DOES KEEP CONFLICT FROM REGION. IF SOVIETS UNDERSTAND WE WANT TO PREVENT DISMEMBERMENT OF PAKISTAN, THEY ARE DETERRED. IT DOES NOT RPT NOT SOLVE ALL PAKISTAN'S PROBLEMS WITH INDIA BUT STILL HAS DETERRENT EFFECT. IF THERE WERE NO <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, AND PAKISTAN FACED ITS PRESENT PROBLEMS, HAD SOMEONE COME WITH THIS TREATY IDEA, PAKISTANIS WOULD BE DELIGHTED.</p>
                        <p>7. AS PAKISTAN MAKES ITS ASSESSMENT, ESPECIALLY PUBLICLY, <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> MUST REMEMBER THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY THE US CONGRESS ARE ALSO ASSESSING. WITH</p>

                        <p>8. THE SECRETARY CITED NATO. IN ICELAND US IS CRITICIZED BECAUSE WE WON' T ATTACK GREAT BRITAIN. THAT IS SILLY. NATO WAS NOT CREATED TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ICELAND AND BRITAIN.</p>
                        <p>9. ALLIANCE HAS MORE THAN REGIONAL IMPORTANCE, SECRETARY CONTINUED. WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT US PUBLIC OPINION. BILATERAL RELATIONS CANNOT HELP BUT BE DAMAGED BY PUBLIC CRITICISM OF <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>— AND OF OTHER ALLIANCES, FOR IT IS TRUE OF EUROPE AND NATO, OF SEATO.</p>

HE MAKES DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN US MILITARY AID AND PAKISTAN' S REMAINING IN <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, AT LEAST OVER THE LONGER TERM.

THIS MATTER WILL COME UP DURING <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>' S FORTHCOMING STATE VISIT. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. PRES <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> BEGAN ONE- HOUR MEETING WITH ME AT PRESIDENCY JULY 5 WITH COMMENT THAT MINSTATE <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> HAD DISCUSSED WITH ME “PREMATURELY” <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>' S POSITION ON <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>). HE WAS NOT SURE THAT <persName>AHMED</persName> HAD REFLECTED HIS OWN VIEWS PRECISELY. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> THEN RECALLED THAT HIS PEOPLE' S PARTY MANIFESTO CALLED FOR PAKISTAN' S WITHDRAWAL FROM SEATO AND <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, AND HE HAD CAMPAIGNED UNDER THAT MANIFESTO IN 1970. AFTER HE BECAME PRESIDENT, <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> HAD TAKEN OFFICIAL STEP TO WITHDRAW FROM SEATO. HE HAD EXPLAINED TO HIS PEOPLE THAT SITUATION WITH RESPECT <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> HAD BEEN ALTERED BY 1971 EVENTS AND HIS GOVERNMENT</p>

                        <p>2. I REMARKED AT THAT POINT THAT <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> HAD TOLD ME “ACID TEST” FOR PAKISTAN REGARDING <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> WAS WHETHER <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WAS GOING OR NOT GOING TO GIVE PAKISTAN MILITARY AID. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> QUICKLY INTERJECTED THAT <persName>AHMED</persName> SOMETIMES DOES NOT PUT INTO PROPER WORDS JUST WHAT PRESIDENT HAS IN MIND. FACT WAS THAT HIS PARTY WILL WISH TO HAVE FULFILLED ITS MANIFESTO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BEFORE IT HAS TO ENGAGE IN NEXT ELECTION CAMPAIGN. HE WILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THE PEOPLE THAT REVERSAL OF PARTY' S INITIAL POLICY ON <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> WAS OF BENEFIT TO PAKISTAN. BUT, HE SAID, HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT HIS PARTY WOULD HAVE TO FACT NEXT GENERAL ELECTIONS UNTIL AFTER END OF CURRENT (AND LAST) TERM OF <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> ADMINISTRATION. “SO LONG AS <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> IS PRESIDENT WE WOULD NOT LEAVE <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> IF THAT MIGHT IN ANY WAY BE OF SLIGHTEST EMBARRASSMENT TO HIM.” LOOKING AHEAD, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> WENT ON, WHO MIGHT SUCCEED THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON? WHAT MIGHT ITS POLICY BE TOWARD PAKISTAN? WHAT MIGHT BE THE FUTURE OF ALLIANCES IN GENERAL? LOOKING TO THESE FUTURE CONTINGENCIES, AFTER THE END OF THE <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> ADMINISTRATION, HOW COULD HE JUSTIFY HIS <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> POLICY IF HE COULD NOT SHOW HIS PEOPLE SOMETHING OF VALUE LIKE FULFILLMENT OF OUR BILATERAL AGREEMENT (WHICH HE INTERPRETS AS CALLING FOR US MTO PROVIDE SOPHISTICATED MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER STATES ON PERSIAN GULF. HE ASKED, “WHY SHOULD WE BE LEFT OUT?” DESPITE EXCELLENT RELATIONS BETWEEN IRAN AND PAKISTAN, AND DESPITE PAKISTAN'S GRATITUDE AND DEBT TO THE SHAH FOR HIS FRIENDLY CONCERN, <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> DID NOT FEEL IT COULD COUNT ON IRAN TO DO ITS FIGHTING IN CASE OF NEED. “IF THE INDIANS GO FOR OUR SKINS, WE' LL HAVE TO RELY ON OURSELVES.” (<persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> THEN SAID, AS AN ASIDE, THAT HE HAD SENT SHAH A PERSONAL NOTE OF THANKS FOR SHAH' S RECENT STATEMENT TO INDIAN CORRESPONDENT IMPLYING THAT IRAN WOULD GO TO PAKISTAN' S HELP IF LATTER WERE ATTACKED BY INDIA.)</p>

HE REITERATED THAT HE WOULD DO NOTHING WHATSO-EVER TO EMBARRASS PRES. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> BUT, ON THE MERITS, HE DID HOPE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WOULD OPEN UP IN ITS MILITARY COLLABORATION WITH PAKISTAN. THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AHEAD TO AFTER THE <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> ADMINISTRATION.</p>
                        <p>5. I SAID I WAS GLAD THAT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAD TAKEN NOTE OF GREAT SYMPATHY WHICH PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON HAD SHOWN FOR PAKISTAN AND HIS GOVERNMENT.

I SAID I WANTED, HOWEVER, TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF “DIFFICULT DECISIONS” TO WHICH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAD REFERRED WAS ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGE IN OUR MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AGO. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HIMSELF HAD EXPRESSED APPRECIATION AT THE TIME. I DID NOT KNOW OF ANY IMPORTANT NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WHICH MIGHT NOW CALL FOR REVISION IN OUR POLICY. I THEN SUGGESTED THAT BEST SOLUTION FOR ALL CONCERNED OVER LONGER TERM WAS IN SUCCESS OF PEACEMAKING EFFORT WHICH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HIMSELF HAD BEGUN LAST YEAR AT SIMLA. REMOVAL OF TENSIONS, SOLUTION OF DISPUTES AND GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA WOULD SEEM, I SAID, TO OFFER GREATEST SECURITY. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SAID HE AGREED AND HE WANTED TO</p>

                        <p>CONTINUE ON SIMLA COURSE. STILL, HE REMARKED, PAKISTAN NEEDED TO STAND ON ITS OWN FEET. HAVING AN ADEQUATELY STRONG DEFENSIVE POSTURE WOULD COMPLEMENT <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>' S PEACE-MAKING EFFORT. AS FOR INDIANS, HE WENT ON, THEY WOULD GRIPE FOR SOME TIME IF US RESTORED MILITARY AID TO PAKISTAN, BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY WOULD ACCOMMODATE TO THE FACT. I EXPRESSED UNCERTAINTY AS TO HIS JUDGMENT ON THAT MATTER, NOTING THAT <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> SEEMED TO PLACE MAXIMU IMPORTANCE ON OUR MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH PAKIST,. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> RESPONDED THAT, ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT THOUGHT MATTER THROUGH AND DID NOT WISH COMMIT HIMSELF AT THIS MOMENT, PRESUMED EFFECT ON INDIA OF REINSTITUTION OF US MILITARY AID TO PAKISTAN MIGHT BE MITIGATED BY HIS SUGGESTING A KIND OF “NO WAR” PACT.</p>
                        <p>6. OUR DISCUSSION THIS SUBJECT ENDED WITH MY REMARK THAT I WOULD REPORT CONVERSATION PROMPTLY, TAKING SPECIAL NOTE OF CLARIFICATION <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAD GIVEN WITH REGARD <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">AZIZ</persName>

COMMENT: IN <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss> I HAD SPECULATED (CORRECTLY, AS IT TURNS OUT) THAT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> MIGHT TAKE SOMEWHAT SOFTER LINE THAN AHMED ON DIRECT RELATIONSHIP OF US MILITARY AID TO PAKISTAN' S REMAINING IN <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. DECISIVE FACTOR IN <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>' S MIND IS HIS APPRECIATION FOR <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> ADMINISTRATION' S FRIENDLY POSTURE TOWARDS PAKISTAN AND HIS DESIRE AVOID ANY ACTION THAT COULD SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZE HIS GOVERNMENT' S RELATIONS WITH THAT ADMINISTRATION. BENEATH THIS, THERE IS APPARENTLY SINCERE FEELING IN <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>' S MIND THAT ALLIANCE RELATIONSHIP CALLS FOR A MORE OPEN US MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY TOWARD PAKISTAN, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SEES NEARBY COUNTRIES (IN GULF REGION) RECEIVING AMERICAN EQUIPMENT. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> CAN BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> INHIBITIONS ON MILITARY SUPPLY STEMMING FROM BROADER INTERESTS IN SUBCONTINENT; BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE ACCEPTS THESE INHIBITIONS AS COMPLETELY JUSTIFIABLE. THE ISSUE WILL COME UP SHORTLY IN WASHINGTON AND WE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR FRANK DISCUSSION ON IT.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab A is a letter to you from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> of Sri Lanka, asking that urgent consideration be given to Sri Lanka's request for early shipment of PL480 wheat flour. A draft reply for your signature is at Tab A.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>'s letter recalls our provisional pledge of food assistance to Sri Lanka last February. She notes that food supplies in Sri Lanka are expected to fall to a critical level during the last three months of 1973, largely because of poor rains and an anticipated low harvest. The problem is also in part a result of Sri Lanka's traditional inefficient rice pricing system, which has long been a disincentive to production but which the government has belatedly begun to modify.</p>
                        <p>The possibility of a large-scale famine is not as great in Sri Lanka as in other South Asian countries such as Bangladesh and parts of India. However, severe food shortages in Sri Lanka could cause widespread disorder there and perhaps a repetition of the island—wide uprising that almost brought down Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>'s government in 1971. In short, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> is concerned that serious food scarcities, added to already existing inflation, shortages, and other economic difficulties, might lead to unmanageable political instability.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> continues to follow the pragmatic and balanced foreign policy that has produced cordial U.S.-Sri Lanka relations, especially since our security assistance at the time of the April 1971 insurrection and her visit here that fall. Also contributing to that policy have been Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>'s suspicion (unfounded, as far as we know) of Soviet <pb n="2" xml:id="d61-02" facs="d61-02"/>complicity in the insurrection; her uneasiness over India's enhanced friendship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and over India's unrivalled position of dominance on the subcontinent since the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war; and US economic assistance to Sri Lanka, which in recent years has consisted entirely of food aid.</p>
                        <p>Despite our good relations with Sri Lanka and its need for this wheat flour, we are not in a position to make a specific commitment right now. As you know, reduced availabilities of wheat and other commodities for concessional export have injected a new element of uncertainty into the future scope of our PL480 program. The proposed letter to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> at Tab A expresses sympathy and understanding for Sri Lanka's, situation and indicates that we will try to be as responsive as possible, while also pointing out that the PL480 program is currently under review, that we cannot make a specific commitment yet, but will be in touch with her as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> leaves Colombo on Saturday July 28 to attend a conference of Commonwealth heads of government in Ottawa. A prompt response in her hands before she leaves might help to reassure her that we are concerned about her problem, even though we are not quite yet in a position to give a concrete answer.</p>

                            <p>Dear Madame Prime Minister:</p>
                            <p>Your letter of July 10 was a very persuasive description of Sri Lanka's urgent need for food assistance. You can be sure that we appreciate the problems you face in this area and will try to be as responsive as we can. Since we are not in a position to provide a precise answer just yet, I want you to have this prompt explanation of how your government's request is being handled.</p>
                            <p>Your letter recalls the February AID Group meeting, at which the U.S. representative expressed our hope that we would be able to provide $15-18 million worth of wheat flour to Sri Lanka under Title I of Public Law 480. As you know, the intervening moths have seen very serious questions of food availability develop on a worldwide basis, greatly complicating our tasks in making allocations under PL 480.</p>
                            <p>These matters are currently under very active examination within our government. Our Ambassador will keep in close contact with your government as this process continues. Meanwhile, you may be sure that we want to be as helpful as we can and that the points raised in your letter will be taken carefully into account.</p>
                            <p>With warm personal regards,</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>REF STATE 160296; COLOMBO 419</p>
                        <p>1. SUMMARY: US AND <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> NARCOTICS PROGRAMS FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING EXTENT OF PROBLEM AND DEVELOPING <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> CAPABILITY TO SUPPRESS ILLEGAL NARCOTICS TRAFFIC. AT PRESENT SRI LANKA HAS RELATIVELY SMALL NARCOTICS PROBLEM AND <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> HOPES TO PREVENT BOTH GROWTH OF LOCAL CONSUMPTION AND INCREASE IN AMOUNT OF OPIUM SMUGGLED INTO AND THROUGH SRI LANKA. US INPUT TO <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> NARCOTICS PROGRAM — BARRING INTELLIGENCE INDICATING LARGE TRANSSHIPMENT OF OPIUM THROUGH SRI LANKA — WILL REMAIN MODERATE THROUGH <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. DRUG SITUATION:</p>
                        <p>A. ROUGH ESTIMATES OF AMOUNT OF OPIUM ENTERING SRI LANKA FROM INDIA RANGE FROM 5 TO 15 TONS ANNUALLY. EARLIER ESTIMATE OF 5 TO 6 TONS HAS BEEN RAISED BY <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> POLICE ON BASIS RECENT</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>PAGE 02 COLOMB 02330 01 OF 02 181455Z</p>
                        <p>LARGE OPIUM SEIZURE IN INDIA. GANJA (CANNABIS) PRODUCTION IS WIDESRPEAD IN SRI LANKA AND CERTAINLY EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL USAGE, INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINE; 150 TONS OF ILLICIT GANJA PRODUCTION IS REASONABLE ESTIMATE.</p>
                        <p>B. TRAFFICKING ROUTES: OPIUM SEIZURE IN NORTHERN SRI LANKA AND INDIAN CUSTOMS' SEIZURE OF 400 POUNDS OF OPIUM DESTINED FOR SRI LANKA HAVE HIGHLIGHTED POSSIBILITY OF SIZABLE TRAFFIC OF OPIUM ACROSS PALK STRAITS FROM INDIA. US AND <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> OFFICIALS ARE SEEKING TO OBTAIN INFO ON OPIUM ROUTES WITHIN SRI LANKA AND ITS ULTIMATE DESTINATION. SEIZURE OF ONE THOUSAND GALLONS OF PROCESSED HASHISH OIL IN JUNE RAISED STRONG SUSPICION THAT GANJA AND GANJA PRODUCTS ARE BEING EXPORTED. EMBASSY HAS, HOWEVER, NO SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE INDICATING SYSTEMATIC RE-EXPORT OF OPIUM OR GANJA FROM SRI LANKA.</p>
                        <p>C. NARCOTICS CONTROL EFFORTS: ESTABLISHMENT OF POLICE NAR-COTICS DIVISION IN APRIL WAS STEP FORWARD IN NARCOTICS CONTROL BUT DIVISION HAS NOT FULLY LIVED UP TO EXPECTATIONS. WITH SMALL BUT ENTHUSIASTIC STAFF, HEADED BY ENERGETIC SUPER-INTENDENT OF POLICE, DIVISION HAS NOT RECEIVED SUFFICIENT BUDGETARY AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FROM <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss>. IN ADDITION TO HANDICAPS OF LACK OF EQUIPMENT AND FUNDS, ADMINISTRATIVE LOCATION OF UNIT UNDER SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE FOR CRIMES IN COLOMBO PRESENTS DIFFICULTIES FOR EXTENSION DIVISION'S AUTHORITY TO OTHER PARTS OF COUNTRY AND IN DEALING WITH OTHER NARCOTICS-RELATED AGENCIES. SITUATION MAY BE IMPROVED WITH ESTABLISHMENT ON SEPT 13 OF NATIONAL NARCOTICS ADVISORY BOARD, CHAIRED BY DEP MIN OF DEFENCE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, AND COMPOSED OF HIGH-LEVEL REPRESENTATIVES OF POLICE, CUSTOMS, EXCISE, EDUCATION, AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS.</p>
                        <p>D. US HAS CONTINUED EFFORT TO SEEK INFORMATION ON OPIUM AND GANJA TRAFFIC, TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF NEED INCREASED NARCOTICS CONTROL EFFORTS ON PART OF SENIOR POLITICAL AND POLICE OFFICIALS, AND TO DEVELOP WORKING CONTACTS WITH <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> OFFICIALS. IN FUTURE, US WILL ALSO STRESS TRAINING OF <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> OFFICIALS CONCERNED WITH NARCOTICS CONTROL.</p>

                        <p>PAGE 03 COLOMB 02330 01 OF 02 181455Z PHILIPPINE ATTORNEY PIO ABARRO, ASSIGNED TO COLOMBO PLAN BUREAU, ARRIVED IN COLOMBO IN AUGUST. FOLLOWING INITIAL CONSULTATIONS WITH <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> OFFICIALS, ABARRO INDICATED HE WOULD RECOMMEND <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> GIVE FIRST PRIORITY TO STRENGTHENING ANTI-NARCOTICS LAWS.</p>
                        <p>3. SEIZURES:</p>
                        <p>GANJA: LARGEST SEIZURE WAS 271 FOUR-GALLON TINS OF HASHISH OIL NEAR RATNAPURA, SOUTH CENTRAL CEYLON, IN JUNE.</p>
                        <p>OPIUM: FOURTEEN POUNDS WERE DISCOVERED BY CUSTOMS NEAR VELVETTITURAI, NORTHERN SRI LANKA, IN AUGUST.</p>
                        <p>4. RESTATEMENT OF GOALS: LONG RANGE GOALS REMAIN INTER-DICTION OF OPIUM TRAFFIC AND PREVENTING GANJA AND GANJA-BASED PRODUCTS FROM ENTERING INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC. SPECIFICALLY, EMBASSY WILL ENCOURAGE GSL TO UNDERTAKE THESE MEASURES:</p>
                        <p>A. SIGN AND RATIFY 1972 PROTOCOL AMENDING 1961 SINGLE CONVENTION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS;</p>
                        <p>B. STRENGTHEN POLICE NARCOTICS DIVISION AND NEWLY-ESTABLISHED INTER-AGENCY NATIONAL NARCOTICS ADVISORY BOARD;</p>
                        <p>C. INCREASE COOPERATION WITH INDIAN GOVT AND TAMIL NADU OFFICIALS TO CURB OPIUM SMUGGLING;</p>
                        <p>D. ANALYZE AND STRENGTHEN 1956 OPIUM AND DANGEROUS DRUGS ORDINANCE TO INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR HEAVIER FINES AND PRISON SENTENCES FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS;</p>
                        <p>E. COOPERATE WITH <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> INCB.</p>
                        <p>5. PRINCIPAL PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN:</p>
                        <p>A. CEYLONESE UNILATERAL ACTIONS: <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> HAS ESTABLISHED POLICE NARCOTICS DIVISION IN COLOMBO AND NATIONAL NARCOTICS ADVISORY BOARD;</p>
                        <p>
                            <del rend="strikethrough">CONFIDENTIAL</del>
                        </p>
                        <p>PAGE 04 COLOMB 02330 01 OF 02 181455Z</p>
                        <p>B. BILATERAL US-SRI LANKA ACTIONS: IN ADDITION TO EMBASSY WORKING-LEVEL AND AMBASSADORIAL-LEVEL CONTACTS, NEW DELHI DEA AGENT HAS VISITED SRI LANKA AND OPENED GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> NARCOTICS POLICE. DEA HAS PROVIDED LITERATURE FOR TRAINING AIDS AND NARCOTICS IDENTIFICATION KITS TO POLICE NARCOTICS DIVISION. <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> HAS ALSO PROVIDED <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WITH SAMPLES OF OPIUM AND GANJA FOR TESTING IN DEA LABORATORIES;</p>
                        <p>C. MULTILATERAL EFFORTS: <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> REPORTEDLY WILL SEND FOUR MORE PERSONNEL FROM CUSTOMS AND POLICE TO <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> NARCOTICS TRAINING PROGRAM IN COMING MONTHS.</p>
                        <p>6. EMBASSY EVALUATION: PROGRESS CONTINUES SLOW, ALTHOUGH ESTABLISHMENT OF POLICE NARCOTICS DIVISON HAS BROUGHT SOME NEEDED FOCUS TO <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> NARCOTICS CONTROL EFFORTS. ESTABLISHMENT SEPT 13 OF NATIONAL NARCOTICS ADVISORY BOARD SHOULD EVENTUALLY MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION. RATIFICATION OF AMENDMENTS TO SINGLE CONVENTION WOULD BE CONCRETE INDICATION OF STRENGTHENED <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> ATTITUDE TOWARD NARCOTICS, BUT RELATIVELY LOW PRIORITY OF NARCOTICS CONTROL PROGRAM HERE SUGGESTS THAT ACTION WIL NOT BE TAKEN QUICKLY. HAVING OTHER URGENT PROBLEMS, <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> HAS BEEN WILLING TO LIVE WITH NARCOTICS PROBLEM IN SRI LANKA AS IT HAS BEEN PERCEIVIED, THAT IS, LARGE AMOUNT OF TRADITIONAL USAGE OF GANJA, SMALL LOCAL CONSUMPTION OF OPIUM, AND UNKNOWN QUANTITY OF OPIUM TRANS-SHIPPED THROUGH SRI LANKA INTO INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC. LONG-AWAITED CREATION OF INTER-AGENCY COORDINATING BOARD IS, HOWEVER, SIGN OF GROWING AWARENESS OF NEED TO MOBILIZE ALL RESOURCES IN NARCOTICS EFFORT AND IS HOPEFUL DEVELOPMENT. IF IT WERE DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED THAT LARGE QUANTITIES OF OPIUM WERE BEING SMUGGLED THROUGH SRI LANKA AND ROUTES AND NAMES OF TRAFFICKERS WERE IDENTIFIED, GSL WOULD PROBABLY RESPOND WITH COMPARATIVE VIGOR, WITHIN LIMITES ITS RESOURCES, TO SUPPRESS THIS TRAFFIC.</p>
                        <p>7. COUNTRY TEAM RECOMMENDATION: INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING EFFORTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEEK TO DETERMINE MAGNITUDE AND ROUTES OF OPIUM SMUGGLING THROUGH SRI LANKA. IN COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ADVISORY AGENCIES (INCLUDING COLOMBO PLAN AND <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>), WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> TO CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>PAGE 05 COLOMB 02330 01 OF 02 181455Z</p>
                        <p>STRENGTHEN NARCOTICS LAWS. WORKING-LEVEL CONTACTS BETWEEN EMBASSY OFFICIALS, DEA PERSONNEL, AND <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> POLICE NARTICS CONTROL OFFICERS SHOULD BE CONTINUED. EMBASSY RECOMMENDS HIGH <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> POLICE OFFICIALS BE INVITED TO VISIT UNITED STATES FOR NARCOTICS BRIEFINGS AND CONSULTATIONS, AND THAT KEY OFFICIALS ON NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT BE GIVEN RELEVANT TRAINING IN UNITED STATES. AS <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> STRENGTHENS ADMINISTRATIVE BASE FOR NARCOTICS CONTROL EFFORTS AND NARCOTICS PROBLEM BECOMES CLEARER, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> MAY WISH SPONSOR TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR GREATER NUMBERS OF <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT STAFF, PERHAPS IN FORM OF VISIT TO DEA TRAINING TEAM TO SRI LANKA. AT THAT TIME, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> MAY ALSO WISH TO PROVIDE <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> WITH EQUIPMENT OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE IN VIEW CRITICAL SRI LANKA FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITION.</p>

                        <p>(S) <persName corresp="#p_WJ3">John Wilberforce</persName> of the British Embassy came into State this afternoon to give the UK answer on Diego Garcia. I was present.</p>
                        <p>(S) <persName corresp="#p_WJ3">Wilberforce</persName>, reading from his cabled instructions, made the following points:

                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> has no major problem in agreeing with our proposal for upgrading Diego Garcia.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>In making this decision, the Ministers had very much in mind the need to check Soviet naval expansion in the Indian Ocean and to assure that vital Indian Ocean sea lanes remain open. They believe there is a need for the US and the UK to elaborate joint or harmonized policies in the common goals and activities in the area. They will have some specific suggestions along these lines.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Although they envisage the agreement on Diego Garcia as a confidential diplomatic exchange, the Ministers expect the existence of that agreement to become public. This could evoke adverse reactions from the Soviets, the Indian Ocean littoral states, and the Arabs. The latter might conclude that the presence of US forces was directed at them presenting an obvious and serious risk to the possibility of the situation in the area. The Ministers are therefore interested in coordinating with the US the way the Diego Garcia matter is presented publicly in both countries.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Public announcement of expansion at Diego Garcia should concentrate on the long held policy of safeguarding critical Western interests in the area.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>As publicity may flow from Congressional and Parliamentary briefings, Ministers recommend a low key briefing with a rationale jointly agreed by the US and UK.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>The agreement itself should be a confidential exchange of diplomatic instruments but with both sides acknowledging its existence. The agreement, among other things, would provide for the operation and joint use of the Diego Garcia facilities in exactly the same way as <pb n="2" xml:id="d65-02" facs="d65-02"/>US bases in the United Kingdom are covered. This would mean that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would be able to assure Parliament that Diego Garcia remains UK sovereign territory.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>The UK welcomes the US initiative to send a team and thinks this will be useful when the discussion gets to the technical and detailed level. As it is necessary to be perfectly clear on the basis on which the two countries are proceeding and the process governing the operation and use of the Diego Garcia facility, the Ministers would like to send a small team to Washington urgently headed by John Thompson, Assistant Under Secretary of the Foreign Commonwealth Office, and including several MOD officials.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>(S) We urged <persName corresp="#p_WJ3">Wilberforce</persName> to have the team come as soon as possible, preferably Monday and Tuesday, January 21-22. He undertook to try to get them here for those dates and, in any event, sometime next week.</p>
                        <p>(S) We sought to get Wilberforce's agreement that we might now say to Congressmen and Senators that we have UK agreement in principle. <persName corresp="#p_WJ3">Wilberforce</persName> said that, although the light is very green, he thought it implicit in his instructions that it would be preferable to wait until next week when common policy objectives and operational criteria can be developed with the British team.</p>
                        <p>(5) I told him that our package of materials, some of which went directly to the points he had specified, was ready. The State people told him they would be delivered to him tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>Dear Sey:</p>
                            <p>(S) The attached information on the proposed upgrade of Diego Garcia and associated actions is provided to assist you in the negotiations with the British, and in our mutual dealings with Congress and the press.</p>
                            <list>
                                <item>- A detailed summary of the expansion effort including the makeup of the items now contained in our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 Budget Supplemental request as well as the follow-on efforts that are under active consideration. This will give <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> a specific view of what we plan immediately, as well as a fairly detailed overview of our longer range plans for Diego Garcia (Enclosure 1).</item>
                                <item>- A proposed recommendation on an exchange of notes with the British to permit the broad and generally unrestricted use of Diego Garcia by U.S. forces. Securing such an agreement, at least in principle, by January 25, 1974 should be a high priority effort because of the ongoing budgetary actions (Enclosure 2).</item>
                                <item>- Defense views on the policy rationale for the Diego Garcia expansion effort. An articulate and persuasive case will have to be made for increased U.S. presence in the Indian Ocean. We recognize the key State role in developing such rationale and encourage any additional suggestions you might have on the matter (Enclosure 3).</item>
                                <item>- A detailed Congressional scenario identifying the appropriate key Congressional leaders who should be briefed, as well as the responsible committees which have to be approached (Enclosure 4).</item>
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d65-04" facs="d65-04"/>
                                <item>- Contingency statements — without Congressional and British approval and with British and Congressional approval — which have been developed by our Public Affairs staff (Enclosure 5).</item>

                        <p>Secretary of Defense</p>
                        <p>Washington, D.C. 20301</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                        <p>According to recent press reports, and subsequently confirmed by letter dated January 28, 1974, from Mr. John O. Marsh of your office, the Department plans to expand the Naval Communications facility on the Island of Diego Garcia, in order to make it a useful and effective support facility for U.S. and British forces which may operate in the Indian Ocean area. In order to initiate this action, the Department proposes to request $29 million in a supplemental appropriation bill soon to be submitted to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, since <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 the Congress has authorized and appropriated $20,450,000 to establish the Naval Communication facility on Diego Garcia. I was concerned about the establishment of such a facility in the first instance, and its possible effect on our foreign policy. It was my understanding, however, that it provided for a badly needed link in our communications network, and it would be confined strictly to the purpose intended, namely communications.</p>
                        <p>It would now appear that the Department intends to go far beyond the original stated intention. I should like to be promptly advised exactly what your present plans are for this installation, and your projected planned activity in the Indian Ocean area for the next 5 to 10 year period.</p>
                        <p>This information is essential to arriving at a determination as to what further action this Committee may wish to take. Very frankly, I feel that this request should have been a part of the proper authorizing legislation for Fiscal Year 1975.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            <p>Washington, D. C. 20510</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                            <p>This is in reply to your January 29 request for additional information on the proposed expansion of facilities at Diego Garcia.</p>
                            <p>As you noted, the present facility on Diego Garcia was established to provide an important link in our worldwide naval communications system. Diego Garcia has proved its worth many times, most recently in providing necessary communications relay during the deployment of additional ships into the Indian Ocean area. The Diego Garcia communications facility was not, of course, designed to provide a capability for sustained logistics support for U.S. forces operating in that region.</p>
                            <p>However, changing circumstances now indicate that we should — in our interest — have the ability to operate routinely on a sustained basis in the Indian Ocean and its environs. The principal changes are:
<list>
                                    <item>- the growing Soviet naval and air presence and capability in the region;</item>
                                    <item>- the probable opening of the Suez Canal permitting the Soviets the opportunity to augment their forces in the Indian Ocean from the Black Sea rather than from their Pacific Fleet, thereby saving about 18 days transit time; and</item>
                                    <item>- the re-emphasized importance of the concentration of critically important oil routes both around the Horn of the U.S. and to Europe as well as across the Indian Ocean to Japan.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>Existing operations in the Indian Ocean must now be supported through rights obtained from littoral states or inefficiently from more distant locations. Inadequate support facilities now limit our ability to demonstrate national interest in this area through routine presence and operations.</p>
                            <p>We are convinced that it is imperative for the U.S. to maintain a balance in the Indian Ocean area vis-à-vis the Soviets. This balance will, among <pb n="3" xml:id="d66-03" facs="d66-03"/>other things, signal the Soviets our intention to continue to play a role in the area, to stand by our friends, and to deter any threats to the shipping routes over which so much of the industrialized world's oil flows.</p>
                            <p>Regarding our projected or planned activity levels in the Indian Ocean for the next five to ten years, the answer depends in part on Soviet actions. At this time, we see a need to be able to augment our naval forces there somewhat more frequently than in the past in order to offset growing Soviet influence. Our presence is not to be tied to a narrow military mission, but rather, it is intended as tangible evidence of our interest — a mutual interest with our allies and the states of the region — in security and stability in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                            <p>In this context, we do not see expanding the Diego Garcia facilities as an event which drives our foreign policy. A more accurate view is that a perception of clear deficiencies in U.S. military capabilities in the region could cause us to lose political and diplomatic influence to the Soviets by default. Therefore, a support facility in the Indian Ocean is in response to our actual foreign policy needs rather than being a potential motivator of policy.</p>
                            <p>Without overstating our case, we believe the matter of developing the Diego Garcia communications facility into a capable yet relatively modest support complex carries a sufficient degree of urgency that it deserves being addressed as part of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 Budget Readiness Supplemental. Hopefully, with prompt Congressional action we will be able to save some six to eight months time toward completing this effort — time which could be important, considering the likely opening soon of the Suez Canal. Proper authorizing legislation under the Military Construction Act will, of course, be sought.</p>
                            <p>The fact sheet enclosed with our earlier correspondence to your Committee contained a breakout of the currently proposed military construction task. Although not completely defined at this time, we do not envisage a need for a very large follow-on effort. For the most part it would be limited to some additional runway construction, added aircraft parking area, more capable command control communications to the facility, and other relative] austere personnel support facilities.</p>
                            <p>We have enclosed a statement covering detailed rationale on the need for deployments in the Indian Ocean and the expansion of Diego Garcia for your review. In addition, we would like to repeat our previous offer to provide you and your Committee with a detailed briefing on our plans.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>
                            <p>SIGNED</p>

                            <head>RATIONALE FOR NAVAL DEPLOYMENTS IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND PROPOSED EXPANSION OF DIEGO GARCIA</head>
                            <p>Current U.S. naval deployments in the Indian Ocean are completely consistent with our policy of periodically augmenting the minimal permanent presence we have maintained in that area for over a generation. The most recent deployments have been prompted by the Soviet naval presence there and their ability to introduce additional forces quickly into the area. Broadly speaking, the Soviets have demonstrated an increased readiness to use military assistance and shows of force to influence events where major U.S. interests are at stake, and to project military power into distant areas, including the Indian Ocean, as Soviet naval forces and airlift capabilities have grown. With the probable opening of the Suez Canal in the next two years, a still greater Soviet naval presence in the Indian Ocean area, which includes the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, will be both possible and probable.</p>
                            <p>In our judgment, an adequate U.S. presence in the Indian Ocean provides a clear signal to the Soviets of our resolve to ensure a credible military capability there. We are confident that the continued presence of U.S. forces in the Indian Ocean will continue to have a salutary effect on the Soviets by underscoring our strategic mobility. We wish to emphasize that our deployments are not a threat to any nation or group of nations. In this connection, no specific tasks have been provided our forces except to maintain general operational proficiency while on station in the area. However, the presence of these forces assures us an adequate <pb n="5" xml:id="d66-05" facs="d66-05"/>capability to meet contingency situations involving friendly governments on or near the Indian Ocean littoral, as well as offering a deterrent effect to potential harassment of significant international straits and sea lanes. These considerations have focused attention on the need for security and stability in the general area.</p>
                            <p>In sum, our capability to deploy a U.S. force into the Indian Ocean supports not only the U.S. national interest, but the interests of our closest friends and allies as well, since such a force provides a tangible reminder of our mutual interest in security and stability in the Indian Ocean. However, maintaining naval forces in the Indian Ocean is not without difficulty. The ships that have been recently deployed have come from the western Pacific. In view of the extended distances involved, it has been necessary to secure bunkering and limited facility support from friendly countries in the area. However, in looking ahead, if we wish to have the capability to move or maintain our ships in the area, development of more practical support facilities seems essential. An obvious solution is Diego Garcia, with some supplemental bunkering and aircraft landing rights elsewhere in the area.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, we intend to expand our communications facility on Diego Garcia to make it a useful and effective support facility for U.S. forces operating in the Indian Ocean area. This facility will be capable of providing support for a flexible range of activities including maintenance, bunkering, aircraft staging, and enhanced communications. The current supplemental military appropriations budget now being presented <pb n="6" xml:id="d66-06" facs="d66-06"/>to Congress contains a request for $29 million to improve support facilities on Diego Garcia. Specific projects we have in mind are increased fuel storage capacity, deepening of the lagoon to provide an anchorage, lengthening the existing 8000-foot runway, and expanding the airfield parking area, in addition to certain improvements to our existing communications facility and construction of additional personnel quarters.</p>
                            <p>As you may recall, in 1965 the British constituted a number of Indian Ocean islands under their control into what is known as the British Indian Ocean Territory. By an exchange of notes on December 30, 1966, the U.S. and UK agreed that these islands would be available for the defense purposes of both governments, initially for a period of 50 years. Under the terms of this arrangement, both governments agreed in principle in December of 1970 to the establishment of a communications facility on Diego Garcia in the Chagos Archipelago. Current plans to develop expanded logistics support facilities at Diego Garcia, available for the use of both U.S. and British forces, are in complete accord with the intent and basic philosophy set forth in the original 1966 Agreement. We will be operating from what will, in fact, be a self-sustained facility on British sovereign territory in the outer reaches of the Indian Ocean with minimal political or military visibility. Thus we believe that to assure our continued ability to deploy U.S. forces into the Indian Ocean area, the facilities we now propose at Diego Garcia are essential.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>There has been little authoritative Soviet comment—public or private—on US activity and plans for the Indian Ocean. This is in keeping with past Soviet practice on this issue. Such comment as there has been has not surprisingly played up the opposition of the littoral countries, and has expressed the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s concern about what the current US activity portends for the future. In the process, Soviet media have expressed fresh interest in the Indian Ocean zone of peace idea (IOZP). If this treatment of the IOZP represents anything more than a short-term attempt to win propaganda points vis-à-vis the US, same more authoritative comment is likely. Even this, however, will not really resolve the problem of how to head off the increase in US naval activity the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> expects to take place as a result of the Diego Garcia decision. This would require a much more specific agreement on great power naval limitations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Soviet propaganda on the movement of the US carrier task group into the Indian Ocean last fall at first did nothing more than replay comments from the littoral countries opposed to the move. The Soviets then described the move as a threat to the Arabs, inconsistent with efforts to achieve a Middle East peace settlement, and as a threat to the littoral states. The Soviets contrasted US behavior with their own support for the IOZP idea and <pb n="2" xml:id="d68-02" facs="d68-02"/>BREZHNEV's own amorphous Asian collective security idea. None of this was very exceptional, nor did it provide any hint that Moscow was taking a fresh look at the problem of future US naval deployment in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Great Power Naval Limitations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was not until December, after Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName>'s announcement that the US planned to deploy ships more frequently in the Indian Ocean that Moscow made an authoritative comment, and raised the possibility that they might be interested in doing more than making cheap propaganda points. On December 12, Pravda carried an article which played up the opposition of the littoral countries to the Secretary's announcement and decried the October deployments in terms similar to the earlier routine propaganda. Pravda ended, however, with a statement that fleet maneuvers by countries far from Asian borders in no way contributed to the relaxation of tensions in the area.</p>
                        <p>This language was reminiscent of the rationale used by BREZHNEV in June 1971 when he said publicly that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> favored limitations on great power naval deployments far from their own shores. In that statement BREZHNEV seemed to be putting on the public record an idea first broached privately by Ambassador Dobrynin in March of 1971. This was that the U and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> issue a joint declaration that the Indian Ocean should be free of military bases and fleet concentrations. The Dobrynin overture in turn seems to have been in reaction to the announcement in late 1970 that the US was building a communications facility on Diego Garcia.</p>
                        <p>Efforts by the US to explore Soviet intentions came to naught. Last week a retired Soviet admiral visiting India told an Indian newspaper that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had tried to reach an understanding with the US on the Indian Ocean, but the US was not interested. This is the first reference by a Soviet to the Dobrynin overture in 1971.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets never seriously followed up on the naval limitation idea, but they have not completely dropped it either. In October 1972, for example, an article in USA reiterated Soviet willingness to discuss “on an equal basis” restricting the cruising areas of the navies of the great powers. In March 1973, another journal <pb n="3" xml:id="d68-03" facs="d68-03"/>offered BREZHNEV's proposal as an alternative to US plans for Trident and Poseidon.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Diego Garcia</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Routine-level propaganda on the recent US-UK announcement regarding Diego Garcia has been similar to that following US deployments in the Indian Ocean last fall. The Soviets have:
<list>
                                <item>— reported comments by littoral countries opposed to the move,</item>
                                <item>— alleged that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has no bases in the area while the US has many,</item>
                                <item>— expressed concern that an expanded Diego Garcia will be used to support increased US naval deployments, particularly carriers and Polaris submarines,</item>
                                <item>— attacked the Chinese for allegedly supporting US actions,</item>
                                <item>— attributed these “aggressive” US moves to the Pentagon and US forces opposed to detente rather than to the Administration itself.</item>
                                <item>— contrasted US behavior—which is contrary to the “spirit of the times” with Soviet support for Asian collective security and the IZOP.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The propaganda notwithstanding, authoritative comment has been limited on the Diego Garcia base and the question it raises. Pravda and Izvestiya reported the announcement on February 6-7, and Izvestiya cited an Indian press account which charged that Diego Garcia would be used to support Polaris submarines, combat ships, and military aircraft. On February 10, Pravda disingenuously argued that the US could not justify expanding the base on Diego Garcia as a reaction to the Soviet naval presence in the Indian Ocean because the Soviet ships there serves only peaceful purposes. US activity, Pravda charged, was really aimed at the African liberation movements and littoral states trying to increase their economic and political independence. Pravda concluded by noting that the move had aroused fear and concern on <pb n="4" xml:id="d68-04" facs="d68-04"/>the part of these countries who advocate that the area become a zone of peace. In short, Pravda did not go much beyond the line taken in the routine propaganda.</p>
                        <p>As befitting a military journal, a Red Star article on February 13 talked about the military consequences of the Diego Garcia base. It stated that the base would service US carriers and nuclear submarines and would effectively link US bases in Africa and the Arab world with those in Southeast Asia and Australia. Red Star dismissed US statements that the decision had been prompted by the advantages the Russians will gain as a result of the reopening of the Suez Canal. It piously proclaimed that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—in contrast to the Pentagon—was working to create a healthier climate in the Indian Ocean basin. As proof, Red Star cited the communique issued at the end of BREZHNEV's visit to India in late November when the Soviets agreed to work “toward resolving the question of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.”</p>
                        <p>The idea of keeping the Indian Ocean free of the great powers' rivalry has been a pet theme of Sri Lanakan Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> since the early 1960s. It gained considerable support from other Afro-Asian countries after the British announced plans to withdraw their forces east of Suez and after initial Soviet deployments there. The concept is still ill-defined, but it has been endorsed at the last two nonaligned conferences. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly passed a resolution in 1971 proclaiming that the area—”within limits to be determined"—be for all time a zone of peace, and urging the great powers to halt their military escalation and remove their bases and nuclear weapons from the area. Two more <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions have been passed since then, and a committee is studying ways to implement them. As a first project, the committee has decided to prepare a study, due late next month, on the great powers' military presence in the Indian Ocean “in all its aspects.”</p>
                        <p>Until recently, Moscow has been lukewarm to the Indian Ocean zone of peace idea reportedly because of its implications for freedom of navigation. It abstained on, all the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> votes. In a speech last November during his visit to India, however, BREZHNEV cited the IOZP idea as one of a number of interesting Asian initiatives that could contribute to his own Asian collective security idea. And, as noted above, in the communique issued at the end of the visit, he went a bit further, agreeing to work together with all other interested parties toward making the idea a reality.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d68-05" facs="d68-05"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">What it Means</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moscow's more positive public line on the IOZP idea may be nothing more than an opportunistic attempt to win points at the expense of the US. BREZHNEV's favorable references to the IZOP while in India were surely aimed at this. Moscow may believe that support for IOZP costs the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> nothing as long as the US continues to oppose it. Furthermore, it gives the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> an argument to counter protests against its own naval activity in the Indian Ocean. Indeed, Moscow may share US concern about the IOZP's implications for freedom of navigation. In any event, a change in the Soviet attitude will not really be put to the test until the IOZP question again comes to a vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Soviet support for the IOZP, however, does not resolve Moscow's problem of how to forestall an anticipated increase in US naval activity in the area. The Soviets will do what they can militarily to counter US deployments, but they cannot match the US without drawing down forces now allocated to higher priority tasks elsewhere. If the Soviets are really interested in limiting Indian Ocean deployments, therefore, they may go beyond the IOZP and raise again in the bilateral context the BREZHNEV-Dobrynin concept of 1971.</p>

                            <item>Reply to Letter from Sri Lanka Prime Minister</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab B is a letter to you from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> of Sri Lanka, expressing concern over US-British plans for the expansion of naval facilities on the British-owned island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. A proposed reply is at Tab A.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, US-British plans for the expansion of our joint naval communications facility on Diego Garcia call for the development of ship and aircraft support facilities and the construction of additional barracks and fuel storage capacity. The purpose of this expansion program, which will cost the US about $29 million, is to provide improved support facilities for our naval forces in the Indian Ocean region in order to reduce their dependence on faraway US support facilities in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>'s letter expresses her government's “grave anxiety” and “deep concern” over the Diego Garcia expansion, and urges that it be reconsidered. Her position is not surprising; she has long been personally committed to the concept of a demilitarized “zone of peace” for the entire Indian Ocean (a concept which we have not supported because of its impracticality and its inconsistency with broader US policy objectives). In addition, she probably wants to avoid being attacked by the many influential Ceylonese politicians within and outside her coalition government who periodically accuse her of being too friendly toward the United States. She remains anxious to maintain good relations with the US, however. Therefore, she has handled the matter through a personal letter to you rather than by turning it into a major public issue. Her letter is generally restrained and avoids making any threat or suggestion that our bilateral relations will be damaged. Meanwhile, her government has been minimizing the amount of publicity being given to the Diego Garcia question in Sri Lanka's largely government controlled press.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d69-02" facs="d69-02"/>
                        <p>The proposed reply at Tab A stresses that our naval presence in the Indian Ocean is consistent with our interest in peace and detente and is designed to help maintain a military balance, particularly in view of the expanded Soviet access to the region that will result from the prospective reopening of the Suez Canal. The proposed reply focuses on these points because the Ceylonese are uneasy over growing Soviet strength in the region and particularly over what they fear could be Indo-Soviet collusion at the expense of smaller states.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION: That you sign the proposed reply to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> at Tab A. (Text approved by Mr. Gergen's office.)</p>

                            <p>The White House</p>
                            <p>March 1, 1974</p>
                            <p>Dear Madame Prime Minister:</p>
                            <p>I have read with care your message of February 11 regarding the expansion of the Anglo-American facilities at Diego Garcia. I appreciate your confidence in writing directly and frankly to me on a subject that I know is of great concern to you. I believe direct correspondence on such a matter is more productive than a debate through the public media.</p>
                            <p>The decision to expand facilities at Diego Garcia does not represent any diminution of our strong interest in detente and in the consolidation of world peace. We earnestly look forward to the day when military facilities and weapons can be reduced worldwide. As you know, we are pursuing this objective in such negotiations as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the talks on force reductions in central Europe. Arms limitation is a goal of major importance—one which I know is central to your own policies. It is also one which will take time to achieve.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime, we believe that the maintenance of a general military balance is necessary for the preservation of peace and for the establishment of an environment in which meaningful and balanced force limitations can take place. It is in this spirit that the decision to expand the facilities on Diego Garcia was made. This decision does not envisage the basing of military units on the island. The facilities to be established there are to provide logistical support for the operation of US naval ships when they are in the area. We believe that this capability is particularly <pb n="4" xml:id="d69-04" facs="d69-04"/>important in light of the prospective reopening of the Suez Canal, which will give other world naval powers greatly shortened lines of communication between the Indian Ocean and their homelands.</p>
                            <p>Finally, I want to emphasize that the United States is not seeking to establish a position of special privilege in the Indian Ocean region. I also want to reassure you in the strongest possible terms that the expansion of facilities at Diego Garcia is not directed in any way against the interests of Sri Lanka or other countries in the region.</p>
                            <p>With warm personal regards,</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>

Before I left I told the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary that you would probably ask about that, so I asked what could I say. This is a difficult one.

                            <hi rend="underline">Sir John Hunt</hi>: I cannot tell you that the ultimate decision will be positive because Ministers genuinely have not looked at it. I know the Prime Minister wants to be helpful. It would be better if the decision came in a few months.</p>

                            </hi>: In all honesty, if it were a negative decision you would pay a price out of all proportion. Defense is really concerned.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Sir John Hunt</hi>: It would be a great pity if the idea got out that there is disagreement over this.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador Ramsbotham</hi>: What about Senator <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName>'s proposal that first there should be an overture to the Russians? A self-denying agreement.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Sir John Hunt</hi>: There is one question that I would like to ask about Diego: The Foreign Secretary wondered if it was a good idea to try to engineer some sort of Indian Ocean Conference, to convince Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> and others that it is a good idea.</p>

                            </hi>: My experience is the Indians will calm down very quickly, that we are paying no lasting price with them, and the time will come when they will be grateful.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: This is a long cable. Try to read to the end. What you will find there, after some talk about US interests in the Indian Ocean and Indian concerns, are suggestions about how through political initiatives we might promote our security interests in the area. In essence we would like to have a simple consistent, long-range rationale for whatever we are going to do with respect to deployments and basing out here. Something we in the field can count on, can lean on. And we would hope for more active US participation in molding to our own purposes ongoing discussions about Indian Ocean restraints, limitations, and peace zone. END SUMMARY</p>

                            <item>Sitting in Delhi, we of course don't have a full picture of where the balance of US interests fall with regard to our military posture in the Indian Ocean: the range of our political, economic, and military objectives toward the Indian Ocean littoral states, the Middle East, China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We've not been told. Perhaps we don't really need to know.</item>

                            <item>The US has had ships sailing in the Indian Ocean for years. Why do we just now find it important to build up our facility <pb n="3" xml:id="d72-03" facs="d72-03"/>on Diego Garcia? Merchant ships have not been interfered with on the high seas except in time of war for decades. Do we really require a substantial naval presence in order to keep the sea lanes open? Do we believe that an over-the-horizon presence of a naval flotilla will significantly change or influence the policies of the oil states of the Middle East? Or India? Do we believe the Soviets intend to use their vessels to threaten the countries of the area, and that we would not have sufficient time to react in their defense unless we have a more regular and systematic presence in the Indian Ocean? Or that a US naval presence is relevant to a Soviet threat to littoral states inherent in the Soviets' geographic propinquity? Is it our assessment that the movement of the Hancock Task Force played a significant role in the Middle East crisis last fall?</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>All these are questions the Indians have asked us, and which we find it difficult if not impossible even to attempt to answer. They all relate to the broad strategic view the US has of this area and how we believe our military resources play a role in influencing policy and events. They are not all questions we would or even should answer if asked. But the answers should be made clear and understandable to all US diplomats if they are to comprehend the well-springs of our policy in this area of the world.</item>

                            <item>There are three possible interests in the Indian Ocean: (1) free and unimpaired movement for US and allied merchant <pb n="4" xml:id="d72-04" facs="d72-04"/>ships particularly to the Persian Gulf—and for our naval vessels in moving between oceans; (2) an option to deploy SLBM's in this strategic area; (3) a capability at some point, if we wish, to exert pressure for political/military reasons on some of the countries bordering the ocean and a capability to inhibit the Soviets from doing so. The first interest is clear and unexceptional to India and, we believe, to all the other countries on the Indian Ocean littoral. The second is one of those closet skeletons which many of the littoral countries suspect, which some—including India—fear, and which virtually all will believe to be true regardless of what we may profess in public. The third interest is the one which would create the greatest frustration and suspicion in India and whose rationale we, quite frankly, would find most difficult to explain and justify.</item>

                            <item>India's colonial experience of assault from the sea still lingers vividly in Indian minds and was freshly polished by the Enterprise Task Force in 1971. For Indians, aircraft carriers and their entourage mean potential intervention. True, India was more than happy to have a US naval presence in the Bay of Bengal in 1962 when it was being pursued by the Chinese, but precisely for this reason it assumes that a US naval presence in the Indian Ocean is designed to permit the US to threaten to intervene elsewhere—perhaps against India the next time. And the testimony given this spring on the Hill in connection with Diego Garcia encourages this conclusion since it frankly envisages US <pb n="5" xml:id="d72-05" facs="d72-05"/>forces functioning as a deterrent with regard to “internal tensions” and “unresolved differences” between neighboring states in the area.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Looked at from the vantage point of New Delhi, we conclude that the Indian Government is sincere in its belief that a substantial US military presence in the Indian Ocean area is not the Indian interest. The presence is directed either at the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in which case the Soviets will certainly build up a counter-force to deal with it, or it is directed at other Afro-Asian states, in which case the Soviets may also become involved. Moreover, the Indians see themselves as big boys on the Indian Ocean littoral and don't want any external powers mucking about in the water to balance off neighbors against one another. They are more suspicious of a US presence than a Soviet presence because they see the Soviets as being on the defense against a potential US SLBM threat in the Indian Ocean and because in the past the Soviets have almost always supported India politically. At the same time, the Indians are wary that a growing US presence could give rise to Soviet pressure for base or port rights, perhaps as a gentle request for a quid pro quo for Soviet help in time of particular Indian economic debility. The Indians are also suspicious that the Chinese, while criticizing the US, have been more energetic in attacking the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean and may thus be subtly encouraging US moves.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The Indian Government has responded to domestic and <pb n="6" xml:id="d72-06" facs="d72-06"/>parliamentary pressures—mainly Communist but from within its own ranks as well—by reasonably moderate affirmations of its opposition to the US naval presence and base and by supporting efforts to make the Indian Ocean a Zone of Peace. While moderate, these statements have not been disingenuous. That's what the Indians believe. That's what they're doing. The moderation has been prompted (a) by a desire not to allow Diego Garcia and US naval movement to undermine prospective economic cooperation with the US and (b) by considerable skepticism that the Peace Zone idea will bear fruit. But the Indians have been active—spurring on the ad hoc committee in New York and drumming up support among the littoral nations. On the substance of any Indian Ocean Zone of Peace, the Indians have favored formulations that tend to work against great power activities in the Indian Ocean, but they have been suspicious of and have resisted Sri Lanka's occasional interest in constraints that would foreclose military options for India.</item>

                            <item>Are the Indians playing a Soviet game? Not really. Their interest in campaigning against a US presence in the Indian Ocean happens to parallel the Soviet interest. (Soviet media here have been hammering away at the Diego Garcia threat.) But the Indians are delighted to be able to talk to the Australians, New Zealanders, and others about this issue and, if they came under Soviet pressure, we believe they would cite these consultations and positions taken as reasons for not <pb n="7" xml:id="d72-07" facs="d72-07"/>accommodating Soviet demands.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>The Soviets, whatever their blacker thoughts about the IOZP, appear from our vantage point to have handled the issue rather well. The BREZHNEV statement in June 1971 provided a basis for publicly maintaining a positive posture. And the BREZHNEV-<persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> joint declaration in November 1973—affirming a readiness “to participate, together with other states concerned, on an equal basis, in finding a fair solution to the question of making the Indian Ocean a Zone of Peace"— has served the Soviets well. It has been cited here as a clear indication of Soviet cooperativeness—and of course it hasn't cost the Soviets a kopek in terms of restraining their Indian Ocean activities. Such as they are, these activities have continued untrammeled by elaborate public rationales.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>So much for the past. For the future, it seems to us we need first of all a simple, minimal, and above all consistent long-range rationale for whatever we are going to do with respect to deployments and basing in the Indian Ocean. And a rationale that is accepted and adhered to by all agencies of what is, after all, one US Government. If we know why we need to be in the Indian Ocean, and that tomorrow's reason will be similar to that of today, the us Government can structure a public posture consistent with intentions and plausible to its own loyal defenders.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Second, more serious consideration of how we can <pb n="8" xml:id="d72-08" facs="d72-08"/>promote our interests with respect to the Indian Ocean not simply in terms of one or another naval option but also through political initiatives. The question of Indian Ocean restraints, or limitations, or Zone of Peace is an issue now very much in play, with even such allies as the Australians telling the soviets to talk to us about it and talking about it themselves with the Indians. And it is an issue that will remain in play and can undercut our objectives, both in terms of international pressures and domestic support at home—particularly if we continue an aloof hands-off posture.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>Proposals for Indian Ocean naval restraints and the IOZP, it seems to us, are messy, diffuse, and largely political. They have a lot to do with domestic postures and undercutting the bona fides of opponents. They are not readily susceptible to discrete arms control solutions. The Indian Ocean countries are, after all, a menagerie, not a species, and we suspect it will be difficult to find sufficient common interest among regional countries and outside powers to provide a basis for any generally accepted limitations. But, this is an issue that we should try to manage, to mould, to cope with as best we can in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> context and outside—with the expectation that solid agreements will not be reached and that majority resolutions are not going to determine our security interests in the area.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>Specifically, we suggest Washington consider:
<list>
                                    <label>(a)</label>
                                    <item>A major statement at an appropriate time in an <pb n="9" xml:id="d72-09" facs="d72-09"/>appropriate forum of our support of the objective of a peaceful Indian Ocean. We have already said as much softly. In explaining our abstention on IOZP resolutions at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, we stated that the US shares the desire to promote conditions of peace and tranquility in the Indian Ocean area and to seek to avoid a competitive expansion of military strength on the part of the major powers. Similar themes have been echoed in recent testimony. What needs to be done is to proclaim these thoughts in a significant, widely publicized statement. An affirmation of positive objectives can help undercut an otherwise negative image of US opposition to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions and the aspirations of littoral states—and US deployments in the face of these resolutions and aspirations.</item>
                                    <label>(b)</label>
                                    <item>An affirmation of basic criteria for any Indian Ocean restraints, limitations, or zone that would protect US interests, e.g., any restraints must bear equally on littoral states and relevant external powers (a concept hardly to India's liking); all littoral states and permanent members of the Security Council should be included at all stages in discussions of restraints (the Tanzanians, say, are unlikely to sit down with the South Africans for this purpose); a disclaimer to protect our law-of-the-sea concerns; and so forth. Washington, we are sure, can develop criteria on the basis of which we could move from aloofness and abstention to active participation in international discussion of Indian Ocean issues. As it is, we have <pb n="10" xml:id="d72-10" facs="d72-10"/>largely abandoned the formulation of the terms of reference for this discussion to countries whose interests are quite different from our own. Moreover, by refusing to join in a dialogue, we frustrate, antagonize, appear indifferent to the views of the countries around the Indian Ocean littoral, and add to an image of provocation and threat when we do engage in naval activities in the area.</item>
                                    <label>(c)</label>
                                    <item>Thus we would urge that we engage in active consultations with relevant countries on the issue of Indian Ocean restraints. Consultations are going forward without us, headed we believe not toward any agreement but toward a manipulation of the issues in ways that undercut our interests. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> ad hoc committee is at work. Peace Zone resolutions get more votes each year. We are likely to be the principal target at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this fall. The Indians are apparently canvassing the idea of some sort of conference of Indian Ocean littoral states and external powers. Armed with a clear rationale for our present Indian Ocean activities, a statement of our positive objectives, and US criteria for any restraints, we believe we could insert ourselves into this process and do pretty well or as well as the Soviets. At a minimum, we might learn more about how Indian Ocean countries see their varied and conflicting interests in the Indian Ocean and elicit greater cooperation in managing proposals and initiatives by others in coming years.</item>
                                    <label>14.</label>
                                    <item>In sum, we would like to see Washington think more about <pb n="11" xml:id="d72-11" facs="d72-11"/>how, through active political efforts, we can further anal protect our security interests in the Indian Ocean area. We believe the returns both in terms of greater international understanding and domestic support for US interests could be considerable. Let's put our diplomats to work!</item>

                        <p>2. I HAVE WORKED FOR TWO PRESIDENTS, ONE DESTROYED, ONE SAVAGELY ASSAILED, FOR PERSISTING IN VIETNAM POLICY WHICH THEY KNEW TO BE WIDELY SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF ASIA, WHICH GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER MAINLY STATED THEIR SUPPORT IN PRIVATE AND MAINLY WERE ALOOF OR HOSTILE IN PUBLIC.I DARE TO THINK THAT BOTH PRESIDENTS UNDERESTIMATED THE INFLUENCE OF THESE PUBLIC POSTURES ON AMERICAN OPINION. SENATOR HUMPHREY'S RECENT COMMENT ABOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR OUR VIETNAM POLICIES IS A CASE IN POINT. NO GREAT STIR OCCURRED HERE OR IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE EVEN THE INFORMED PUBLIC COULD NEVER BELIEVE INDIA WOULD DO ANY SUCH THING.</p>
                        <p>3. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT I THOUGHT OUR VIETNAM POLICIES WERE MAD, THAT THEY WOULD DANGEROUSLY WEAKEN OUR WILLINGNESS TO OPPOSE TOTALITARIAN COMMUNISM IN THE WORLD. THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE WEAKENED, FOR EXAMPLE, OUR ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING FAIRLY MODEST AND PROBABLY SENSIBLE, WHICH IS BUILD UP DIEGO GARCIA A BIT.</p>
                        <p>4. NOTE THAT AMERICAN OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT IS MOVING IN THE VIETNAM DIRECTION. I HAVE READ CAREFULLY THE HOUSE DEBATE ON THE APPROPRIATION. (AND I WOULD ASK SUSPICIOUS SOULS AT HOME TO NOTE THAT THE ONE CONGRESSMAN WHO COULD SAY HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN IN DELHI AND HAD FOUND NO SERIOUS OPPOSITION TO DIEGO GARCIA HERE WAS PETER FREYLINGHUYSEN, WHOM I ESCORTED ABOUT. HIS SPEECH WAS FORCEFUL AND I EXPECT CONVINCING. I WOULD ASK THE PENTAGON TO TAKE NOTE. I WOULD ASK THE PENTAGON GENERALLY, HOWEVER, TO NOTE THE WRITTEN STATEMENT OF LEE HAMILTON. (HE WAS AWAY IN INDIANA, CONCERNED WITH THE THEN RECENT TORNADO.) IT WAS A REASONED, MODERATE, AND OMINOUS STATEMENT. HE HAD NOT BEEN CONVINCED. NOR HAD HE THOUGHT THE HOUSE HAD CONSIDERED THE MATTER. THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE REPORT ON DIEGO GARCIA WAS BOILERPLATE FROM ADMIRAL ZUMWALT'S TESTIMONY. I REPEAT, I HOPE THIS IS</p>

HE IS BY FAR THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE AND INFORMED MEMBER OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THIS AREA: POSSIBLY OF EITHER HOUSE. HE IS NOT A FLASHY MAN: HE IS, RATHER, THE KIND OF MAN WHO HAS INFLUENCE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. I WOULD BE VERY WORRIED IF I WERE THE MILITARY AND FACED THE FACT OF HOW LITTLE HE WAS IMPRESSED WITH ADMINISTRATION ARGUMENTS.</p>
                        <p>4. IF I WERE THE MILITARY I WOULD WORRY EVEN MORE ABOUT WHAT WOULD SEEM TO BE AN AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION THAT WE CAN DO NOTHING TO INFLUENCE POLITICAL OPINION IN ASIA, THAT ALL WE CAN DO IS MUSCLE OUR WAY ABOUT WITH WHAT MUSLCE WE HAVE LEFT. IS THAT WHAT REMAINS OF AMERICAN MORALE AFTER VIETNAM. THEN IT REALLY WAS A DISASTER.</p>
                        <p>5. WELL LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE MORALE AT THIS EMBASSY IS HIGH AND GETTING HIGHER. WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO LET DIEGO GARCIA BE A TOTAL LOSS TO AMERICAN DIPLOMACY UNLESS WASHINGTON BY DEFAULT ORDERS US TO SURRENDER. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THE SECRETARY CAN FIND TIME FOR.

                        <p>PLACE: The Cabinet Room</p>
                        <p>(The Press came in for photos)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: How have you been?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">CALLAGHAN (UK)</hi>: I remember our seminar in Number 10 Downing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: That was CALLAGHAN's job.</p>
                        <p>(The press departs)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I am delighted to meet with you. <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> in the minds of the world has much less meaning than there used to be. Even here, the Turks and Pakistanis say “What good is it when we have a military problem? We just sit around and talk.” Candidly, the Iranians' feeling is that they can take care of themselves.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Why continue <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>? Let's start with the bottom line</hi>: As a military alliance, it isn't there — it's not like NATO. But we have common interests including military concerns — like the survival of Pakistan. For us, that is of vital importance. To <pb n="2" xml:id="d74-02" facs="d74-02"/>have healthy, strong economies in this group of nations is vital. It is important in the future of South Asia, and the survival of each country with some sort of — not guarantee — but an added element to discourage those who might infringe on your sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>The United States is bilaterally committed to each of you - - not only to your survival but to cooperate economically for progress.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the U.S. has this commitment — shared by Great Britain — has a restraining influence on those who might be tempted — to go under or over a border to destroy a country's independence.</p>
                        <p>So what we have should not be detracted. The situation is different from the Dulles days, but the need remains. Like the NATO situation has change, but if it weren't there, adventurism would be encouraged.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">CALLAGHAN</hi>: Don't even mention it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: But whatever the country in NATO — Great Britain, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy - - if they didn't have association and the U.S. holding the ring against any super power — if that didn't exist, the race to Moscow would go apace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">CALLAGHAN</hi>: That's right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Now individually. I wish we could have done more for Pakistan in the previous struggle. As far as the U.S. is concerned, one partition of Pakistan is enough. And, considering Congressional concerns, we will do whatever we can to support Pakistan's independence and strength. We have done something; perhaps we can do more. Pakistan's problem is most delicate. To the extent the U.S. reestablishes a dialogue with India, our influence will be to restrain India.</p>
                        <p>We don't want a monologue. We consider this alliance, which came in when the threat was very different…. there have been many changes, with the Soviet Union, etc. Pakistan has had a tragedy. But no more.</p>
                        <p>What can <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> do about all these things? What does the commitment mean if it is not backed up by military responsiveness? It does mean something, because if we share a common commitment we can be helpful to each other whatever the problem.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Assan</hi>: Thank you for seeing us. I know how busy you are. In the past two days we have referred more than once to the strong words you gave us last year. We all thank you for your strength and encouragement. We know the situation has changed but we think the need for the alliance continues. We have talked about tracing our course for the future. It has been a great meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: The original reason for <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> — like NATO — was security. We now need more — to broaden our relations.</p>
                        <p>If I could digress to the Middle East a bit. Basically in the Syrian-Israeli talks we have had a breakthrough. I have been bouncing messages to Israel and to a lesser degree to Syria over the past weeks. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has done a magnificent job. Disengagement will come — maybe not this week. The major problem has been dealt with, but the lesser ones could hang us up — they become relatively more important.</p>
                        <p>But disengagement is only temporary. And negotiations will now go forward in Geneva for a permanent solution — like Jerusalem, that is the toughest nut. We are accused of playing a unilateral role by pushing others out.</p>
                        <p>The reason Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is there getting a disengagement is because we are the only one who can broker it now. Our purpose is not to establish American domination or to exclude others from economic or political development in the area. Some other countries of the area don't want the Soviet Union, some may. Israel can't event talk to them.</p>
                        <p>The policy is to move all the parties to participate in a settlement. We carry the major burden because we can move Israel, and without that, no settlement can be made. For Israel, it is far better to have the U.S. as a friend of Egypt than an enemy of Egypt. Sophisticated leaders within Israel like Rabin understand; the Jewish community wants exclusive American support of Israel.</p>
                        <p>Israel feels that with arms they can win over the foreseeable future. Not as well as before, but they made it costly. But Israel's ability to survive must not depend on an acre of sand, but on the attitude of her neighbors and whether these neighbors make a confluence of power opposed to Israel's survival.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d74-04" facs="d74-04"/>
                        <p>We feel the interests of us all here are served by our negotiating realistically with the Soviet Union. We have no illusions, nor do they. When t he Soviet Union has to make a decision whether to meddle, they must weigh that against everything else they have on the plate with the United States. We need idealistic talk, but we have to be pragmatic.</p>
                        <p>In the Middle East, despite our different interests and vital as it is—-for the Soviet Union they see the resources and geographic position and their game is understandable; the U.S. has a special tie with Israel which has hurt us with the Arabs. This tie doesn't serve the United States. Looking down the road, the U.S., Israel and Arab interests will be served by the U.S. playing a constructive role and not tied just to Israel. As I told Prime Minister WILSON, there can't be permanent peace unless we are for it, to influence Israel. It can't be done if the Soviet Union is against it, because of their power.</p>
                        <p>Our policy is toward the whole world. With the Soviet Union, for example, we are working on SALT — it is internationally important. Each of us can destroy the other within an hour. Neither one of us has illusions about the other, but if they are in isolation or in a posture of confrontation, they can't listen if we say “Don't push our friends around.” But if they have some other things going….</p>
                        <p>With China, I am the original anti-Communist and Mao is the original Communist. But they are probably concerned about their isolation and possible threat from their neighbors. As they looked around, they saw India, with contempt, to the west the Soviet Union, to the east the United States, to the Northeast, Japan, an economic giant but economically a pygmy. Pragmatically they didn't want a hostile U.S. For the U.S. — each of them has better relations with the United States than with each other — right now the basic threat to survival is the US-Soviet conflict. But one fourth of the world is Chinese, and they have nuclear weapons. They are smart and energetic. In 20 years they will be a major nuclear power. Should we let them sit there in isolation? Or should we develop a dialogue? Now they need us; later they might not. We will try to play a constructive role in China's relations with its neighbors.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d74-05" facs="d74-05"/>
                        <p>We can't insure peace, but our purpose is — we believe in the right of all to chose their own way — to help them to be independent. We fought in Korea and Vietnam for that. But to do that effectively, we must talk to potential enemies to see if there are different incentives for them to pursue different courses. When we go to the Soviet Union and China, we do it to make the world a safer place for our friends.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">CALLAGHAN</hi>: Outstanding. If you weren't President, you would have made a brilliant Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I have visited all your countries. I have a strong feeling for each of them. We want you to survive and we are for you. Sometimes we can do as much as we would like, but our dialogue with the opposition is in support of, not opposition to, our friends. But the Middle East, next to Central Europe, is a vital area for the super powers. Unlike Vietnam—the Cambodia mission, the December bombing—some said the Soviet Union and China would intervene. I didn't think so, because they wanted North Vietnam to succeed but not at the cost of confrontation with the United States. The Middle East is different and Europe especially so.</p>
                        <p>We must realize we are participating in decisions which could decide the peace of the world. We must trust each other. We will maintain our strength so that no one thinks he can bluff us or go to war with us without cost.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">CALLAGHAN</hi>: We need the NATO declaration and the trade bill.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Provided they work out the credit restriction. Otherwise they can't get MFN.</p>

                        <p>(Cuff links are passed out).</p>
                        <p>President: I can tell you a story. Israel was asking for too many F-4's. I told Golda the main thing was trust, that we had problems and that we would do what we could.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: THE PAKISTANIS AT THE <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> MINISTERIAL</p>
                        <p>1. DURING <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> MINISTERIAL PAKS COMMENTED EXTENSIVELY ON FOUR ISSUES: 1) CENTO'S SECURITY ROLE; 2) SOVIET BEHAVIOR AND INTENTIONS IN THE SUB-CONTINENT AND MIDDLE EAST; 3) US MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY; AND 4) THE INDIAN NUCLEAR EXPLOSION.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>'S SECURITY ROLE</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> WAS VERY CRITICAL OF <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>'S FAILURE TO PROTECT PAKISTAN AGAINST THE ONLY REAL THREAT TO IT — INDIA. HE SAID <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> HAD ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING IN ITS 19 YEARS OF EXISTENCE AND HAD SAT IDLY BY WHILE PAKISTAN WAS CUT IN TWO. HE SAID THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN AND THERE IS NOT NOW A DANGER THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD UNDERTAKE DIRECT AGGRESSION</p>

                        <p>AGAINST ONE OF THE <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> REGIONAL COUNTRIES OR THREATEN AGGRESSION. RATHER, THE DANGER COMES FROM SOVIET MILITARY SUPPORT TO IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN AND PARTICULARLY TO INDIA AND THIS IS WHAT <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> SHOULD CONCERN ITSELF WITH. INDIA, HE MAINTAINED, WAS COOPERATING WITH THE SOVIETS BOTH IN IRAQ AND IN AFGHANISTAN BY PROVIDING MILITARY TRAINING TO OFFICERS FROM BOTH COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>BUT, IN SPITE OF THE SCORN FOR <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> HE EXPRESSED, <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> GAVE NO HINT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A PAK WITHDRAWAL FROM THE ORGANIZATION.</p>
                        <p>3. THE SOVIETS, DETENTE AND ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM</p>
                        <p>HE SAID THAT THE SOVIETS HAVE BEEN PRESSING THE PAKS, THUS FAR UNSUCCESSFULLY, TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> ANTICIPATES THAT THE SOVIETS WILL CONTINUE TO EXERT PRESSURE ON IT TO JOIN. WHILE PAKISTAN IS DETERMINED TO RESIST THESE PRESSURES, THE THREAT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY SERIOUS. IN SPITE OF THIS, THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> SEES NO EVIDENCE THAT THE US AND UK ARE PREPARED TO COUNTER SOVIET ACTIONS.</p>
                        <p>THE <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> COUNCIL ENGAGED IN A BRIEF AND GENERAL EXCHANGE ON THE MEANING OF DETENTE IN WHICH ALL AGREED WITH THE GENERAL PROPOSITION THAT DETENTE WAS INDIVISIBLE. BUT WHILE UK FOREIGN SECRETARY CALLAGHAN SUGGESTED THAT DETENTE WOULD NARROW SOVIET OPTIONS OUTSIDE EUROPE, <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> ARGUED THAT THE EVIDENCE INDICATED THE CONTRARY WAS TRUE. DETENTE HAS NOT PREVENTED FURTHER SOVIET PENETRATION OF IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN AND INDIA; IN FACT, PROCESS HAS BEEN ACCELERATED. AT WHAT POINT, HE ASKED RHETORICALLY, DOES ONE SAY TO THE SOVIETS THUS FAR AND NO FURTHER.</p>

                        <p>THOUGH CHINA IS PROVIDING SOME ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN, IT IS NOT IN A POSITION TO SPARE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT. AND, ALTHOUGH PAKISTAN HAS BEEN PURCHASING SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FROM FRANCE, THE FRENCH ARE PROFITING FROM THE REALIZATION THAT THEY ARE IN A MONOPOLY SUPPLIER POSITION; THEY ARE DRIVING HARD BARGAINS WITH PAYMENT IN CASH.</p>
                        <p>5. THE INDIAN ATOMIC EXPLOSION</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>AHMED</persName> PUT A GREAT DEAL OF EMPHASIS ON INDIA'S EXPLOSION OF A NUCLEAR DEVICE. HE SAID THAT INDIA WAS SPENDING HUGE AMOUNTS ON ARMS AND HAD EXPLODED THE BOMB EVEN THOUGH SHE IS STARVING. THE PAKISTANIS SOUGHT TO INCORPORATE THREE ELEMENTS IN THE COMMUNIQUE: 1) AN INDICTMENT OF THE INDIAN ACTION; 2) AN INTERPRETATION WHICH WOULD HAVE REPRESENTED IT AS CAUSING A SET BACK TO NORMALIZATION AND PEACE EFFORTS IN SOUTH ASIA; 3) AND AN ASSURANCE OF SECURITY FOR SMALLER COUNTRIES AGAINST NUCLEAR THREAT. NEVERTHELESS, HE SAID THAT PAKISTAN WOULD NOT ABANDON ITS EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A RECONCILIATION WITH INDIA. HOWEVER, TURKEY, IRAN, THE UK AND US SUGGESTED THAT WHILE THE EVENT WAS CAUSE FOR SOBER REFLECTION, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ANALYZED CAREFULLY BEFORE ITS IMPLICATIONS COULD BE FULLY EVALUATED.

                        <p>SUBJECT: <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> MINISTERIAL MEETING</p>
                        <p>REF: STATE 110376</p>
                        <p>BEGIN SUMMARY: DISCUSSION AT <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING IN WASHINGTON MAY 21-22 CONCENTRATED TO LARGE EXTENT ON INDIA'S NUCLEAR EXPLOSION AND PAKISTANI INDICTMENT OF INEFFECTIVENESS OF <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. WHILE PAKISTANIS PRESSED HARD FOR STRONGLY CRITCAL COMMUNIQUE STATEMENT ON INDIAN NUCLEAR EXPLOSION, ALL OTHER DELEGATIONS WERE FIRM IN THEIR REFUSAL TO OFFER QUICK JUDGEMENT ON IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVENT. AND, ALTHOUGH <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> EXPRESSED SCORN FOR <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, HE DID NOT HINT OR SUGGEST PAKS WOULD WTIHDRAW. END SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MET IN TWENTY-FIRST SESSION MAY 21-22 IN WASHINGTON. US DELEGATION WAS HEADED BY ACTING SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">RUSH</persName>. IRANIAN, PAKISTANI AND UK DELEGATIONS LED BY <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FONMIN</gloss> KHALATBARY, MINSTATE <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> AND FONSEC CALLAGHAN. TURKISH AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON, ESENBEL, HEADED HIS DELEGATION IN ABSENCE OF <gloss target="#t_FONMIN1">FONMIN</gloss> GUNES, WHO CANCELLED HIS PARTICIPATION BECAUSE OF PARLIMENTARY SITUATION IN ANKARA.</p>
                        <p>2. REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SITUATION</p>
                        <p>PRINCIPAL POINTS OF INTEREST WHICH EMERGED DURING RESTRICTED SESSION DEVOTED TO REVIEWING INTERNATIONAL SITUATION WERE REPORTED IN <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>. AN ADDITIONAL ITEM RELATES TO IRANIAN POSITION ON SOVIET ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY PROPOSAL. DURING COURSE OF DISCUSSION <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> STATED IRAN HAD AGREED WITH PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE AND HAD ALSO AGREED TO HELP IMPLEMENT IT. KHALATBARY MADE VERY SPECIFIC REBUTTAL. HE EMPHASIZED THAT IRAN HAD ONLY AGREED TO STUDY THE IDEA AND ON THE UNDESTANDING THE PRC WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEM.</p>
                        <p>3. POLITICAL GUIDANCE FOR MILITARY PLANNING</p>
                        <p>AGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED PRIOR TO MINISTERIAL ON <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> PAPER-ASSESSMENT OF SITUATION IN THE AREA. HOWEVER, DISCUSSIONS IN ANKARA HAD REVEALED RATHER FUNDAMENTAL DIVERGENCE OF VIEWS ON POLITICAL GUIDANCE. OUR OBJECTIVE AT MINISTERIAL WAS TO AVOID HAVING THIS UNRESOLVED ISSUE COME BEFORE MINSITERS. WHILE IT PROVED POSSIBLE TO GET STEERING COMMITTEE TO RECOMMEND PAPER TO COUNCIL OF DEPUTIES, THIS DID NOT PREVENT <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> FROM LAUNCHING INTO A RATHER BITTER CRITICISM OF <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> AND ITS FAILURE TO PROTECT PAKISTAN AGAINST INDIA (SEE <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>). IRAN AND TURKEY, AS WELL AS UK AND US, REITERATED IMPORTANTCE OF <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> BUT AVOIDED GETTING INTO DEBATE WITH <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> ON EITHER POLITICAL GUIDANCE OR <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> ITSELF.</p>
                        <p>4. COUNCIL APPROVE PROPOSALS FOR ENHANCING <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> ACTIVITIES IN ECONOMIC, MILITARY AND COUNTER-SUBVERSION FIELDS. SECRETARY GENERAL MADE SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS: GREATER DEGREE OF POLITICAL CONSULTATION AMONG <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> MEMBERS; INCREASE IN EXCHANGE OF HIGH LEVEL VISITS; MORE CONTACT AND COOPERATION ON WITH NATO; EXPANSION OF PUBLIC RELATIONS AND CULTURAL PROGRAMS. MINISTERS DID NOT RESPOND TO EACH POINT, BUT NONE QUESTIONED ANY OF ASSAR'S SUGGESTIONS, AND HE OBTAINED TACIT APPROVAL TO MOVE AHEAD WITH MORE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS.</p>
                        <p>5. COUNCIL ALSO DECIDED DURING REVIEW OF ECONOMIC COMMITTEE REPORT TO ACCELERATE PLANNING FOR HIGH LEVEL MEETING TO DISCUSS MATTERS OF COMMON INTEREST. TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR MEETING WILL BE WORKED OUT BY ECONOMIC STEERING GROUP AND COUNCIL OF DEPUTIES BEFORE END OF CY 74. US OFFERED TO HOST FIRST SUCH MEETING.</p>
                        <p>6. IRAN AND UK REPS CONFIRMED THEIR INTENTION TO SUPPORT REGIONAL RAILWAY, ROAD AND MICROWAVE PROJECTS. TURKISH REP FAILED TO RESPOND TO IRANIAN'S COMMENT THAT BYPASS AROUND LAKE VAN RAIL FERRY IS REQUIRED. HE INDICATED CONTINUED RELUCTANCE CONCERNING PROPOSAL WHICH WAS APPARENT DURING ECONOMIC COMMITTEE MEETING IN APRIL.</p>
                        <p>7. DURING CONSIDERATION OF MILITARY COMMITTEE REPORT US REP NOTED THAT CONFERENCES INTENDED TO RESOLVE ISSUES REGARDING A COMMON CRYTOGRAPHIC SYSTEM AND AN AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM WILL BE HELD IN JUNE AND JULY.</p>
                        <p>8. APPROVAL OF COUNTER-SUBVERSION AND LIAISON COMMITTEE REPORTS WAS ROUTINE. IRANIAN REP MADE LENGTHY STATEMENT ON IRAQ AS BASE FOR SUBVERSION AGAINST IRAN AND GULF STATES. US AND UK REPS CONFIRMED PLANS TO SPONSOR ANTI TERRORISM-TRAINING FOR NATIONALS OF REGIONAL MEMBERS.</p>
                        <p>9. TURKS AGREED TO NOMINATE REPLACEMENT SECRETARY GENERAL ASSAR WHOSE TERM ENDS EARLY IN 1975, AND TO HOST NEXT MEETING OF COUNCIL IN ANKARA NEXT MAY. <persName corresp="#p_BBWJ1">BROWN</persName>

                            <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 199, directing a study of alternative strategies for the Indian Ocean, evoked reservations at the outset on the part of the participating agencies over the area — both conceptual and geographic — that should be covered in the response. In producing what follows, a strenuous effort has been made to focus on the critical questions raised in the <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> and disregard peripheral issues, many of which have great importance in themselves. Because the previous work, including responses to <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>'s 104, 110, and a comprehensive follow-on to the latter covering arms control possibilities, was extensive and detailed, an effort was made to update rather than rewrite, and refer to specific aspects of the earlier papers, where possible. While this study is meant to stand on its own, it should be read in the context of the earlier <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> responses.</p>
                        <p>The approach is first to assess the principal developments in the Indian Ocean area since 1971 that bear on our force presence and requirements, and thus may change conclusions of the earlier Indian Ocean policy studies. The paper then attempts to define the most important American interests in the area, and the extent to which an Indian Ocean strategy can protect and further those interests. National interests of other outside powers and littoral states are also discussed. The last section of the paper summarizes the most important policy issues and conclusions that emerge from the discussion, and puts forth three alternative sets of options.</p>
                        <p>There is some interagency disagreement over interpretation of Soviet actions and intentions related to the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. This paper tries to delineate the important points at which opinions diverge, and present the alternative views clearly.</p>
                        <p>The options in Part IV have been structured to relate various forms of arms limitation in the Indian Ocean to possible force levels. Each option thus requires a decision on both issues. There is some risk of artificiality in this approach, but the overriding concern was to recognize that choice in one area inevitably impinges on the other, and both must be based primarily on an assessment of threats to our regional interests. Previous work had already established a spectrum of force options and a spectrum of possible arms limitation arrangements. What appeared to be missing was an analysis of how they could be combined for policy decision.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d77-05" facs="d77-05"/>
                        <p>Many of those who participated in this study were dissatisfied with its scope, and would have preferred to deal with force levels in the context of broader political and economic policy packages for Africa, the Middle East, the Subcontinent, and Southeast Asia, on the principle that force levels cannot be justified apart from the integrated US national policies they support. The reader is thus warned at the outset that distortions may result from the study's perspective.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 104 (December 1970) concluded that the US has a low level of interest in the Indian Ocean, but nonetheless required access to the region for a variety of purposes, chief among them oil from the Persian Gulf (at that time principally for Europe and Japan). The area should not pass under hostile control, however. Most of our interests would be served by genuine neutralization. The NSS response acknowledged that the evidence on our level of Indian Ocean interests was ambiguous. The <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> response judged Soviet interests — beyond demonstrating global power and backing Communist movements — to include erosion of our position, exclusion of the Chinese, and prevention of use of the Indian Ocean by US SSBNs. It pointed out that naval presence was used by the Soviets only as an ancillary means to further those interests. The Soviets were expected gradually to increase their naval presence and access to support facilities. In the period 1971-75 Soviet naval activities were not considered likely to threaten US interests. Specifically, it was judged they would not pose a direct threat to sea lanes (for shipment of oil) or access to the littoral states.</p>
                        <p>Other countries — notably the UK, Australia, and Japan — were seen as welcoming a US Indian Ocean presence, the first two actively cooperating and Japan acquiescing (because of its dependence on Persian Gulf oil) in use of Japanese ports for Indian Ocean operations by the US Navy.</p>
                        <p>The naval force options ranged from minimalist — retention of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> and existing shore facilities, including Bahrain and Diego Garcia — through a moderate increase in US/allied visibility, a considerable increase in rotational presence (including CVAs and integrated allied units) to a large permanent presence including airfield and other shore construction. <pb n="6" xml:id="d77-06" facs="d77-06"/>All options stressed the desirability, and assumed the feasibility, of acting in full concert with UK and Australian forces.</p>
                        <p>The study done for <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 110 (April 1971) portrayed the Soviets as still interested in the Indian Ocean region as an area where it could gain advantage over the US, and where it was important to counter potential Chinese expansion. Naval presence alone, again, was judged not to have gained much for the Soviets, and was not judged a threat to our oil interests. Our political interests were considered to coincide basically with those of the littoral states themselves. Two extremely general policy purposes emerged: 1) to inhibit a military competition with the Soviets, while preserving our ability to exert military influence in case of need; and 2) to encourage economic development and political progress in littoral states, maintaining good bilateral relations and inhibiting the development of Communist influence. It was noted, however, that the costs of actually pursuing these purposes without restraint would be unreasonably high. Assuming an economy of means appropriate to the priority of the Indian Ocean region for the US, two alternative strategies were considered: limiting super power military competition, or maintaining a reasonable military presence at a minimum cost. Alternatives in terms of naval presence and basing (along the lines of the 104 study) were discussed under the latter heading. Arms control was raised under the former, but detailed discussion of options left to a follow-on paper.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 110 follow-on (June 1971), Indian Ocean Arms Control, discussed seven arms-limitation options, ranging from “freeze” possibilities (either indefinite or pending a broader agreement), through several specific levels, to an agreement to exclude all forces (except for transit).</p>
                        <p>An interagency paper (chaired by <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>) on Non-Strategic Naval Limitations in the Indian Ocean, dated February 15, 1972, clarified interagency differences at that time over the prospects for, and utility of, an arms control approach.</p>

                                <p>Earlier <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> responses on the Indian Ocean failed to project our requirement for oil imports from the Middle East. The 1973 war and the Arab oil embargo, precipitating an acute awareness of our new, and growing, dependence on petroleum imports, changed our perceptions dramatically. Where the earlier studies noted the importance to us of sea lanes from the Persian Gulf because of our interest in the survival of Western Europe and Japan, we must now add their criticality over an indefinite period for our own economic well being. Implications of the oil problem for our Indian Ocean strategy are discussed in Section III A, on US interests.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>Immediately following the earlier <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> exercises, at the end of 1971, the US took a step unforeseen in those studies by deploying a Carrier Task Force to the eastern Indian Ocean in response to the outbreak of war between India and Pakistan. Seventh Fleet units, including carriers, had entered the Indian Ocean before, but not as part of a deliberate gesture. The hostilities involved us and the Soviets only indirectly, in terms of arms supply and diplomatic support. The movement of the Enterprise probably did not affect the outcome of the war or Soviet support for India. It did, presumably, reassure Pakistan, warn India, and may also have provided a signal to Peking. On the other hand, it sensitized some of the littoral area against such highly visible naval deployments in the future by putting them in the context (as perceived locally) of attempts to coerce less powerful Asian states. (Soviet naval deployments can suffer from this syndrome as well.)</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="underline">Arab-Israeli War - 1973</hi>
                                </p>
                                <p>To reinforce our other political and military moves in the October 1973 Middle East war we deployed the Hancock Task Group to the Arabian Sea in October 1973, and maintained a high level of presence through mid-April 1974. This step was probably seen by others in the context both of our near <pb n="8" xml:id="d77-08" facs="d77-08"/>confrontation with the Soviets at the end of October, and of our dissatisfaction at the Arab oil embargo. As a signal of the gravity we attached to Middle East events it may have lent weight to our subsequent diplomatic efforts to help the parties reach a solution. Our active involvement in seeking a Middle East peace, however, and our acceptability to the Arabs and Israelis as a mediator derive from other factors.</p>
                                <p>Insofar as our task group deployment to the Arabian Sea is seen to be related to the oil crisis of 1973-74, the evidence of its effectiveness is not clear. Oil shipments to the industrialized West and Japan were cut off by political decisions at the wellhead. The effect of a naval presence on decisions related to the oil embargo was probably minimal, although the Arab states could not ignore the possibility that we might at some future time be driven to react with force. The same is likely to be true in the future. We could make explicit our intention to try to keep the oil flowing by force, hut if we appeared to be directly threatening Persian Gulf/Arabian Sea littoral oil producers with our task group deployments the effect could well be retrograde — stiffening anti-American attitudes, strengthening Arab radicals, and perhaps giving weight to Soviet approaches to these countries.</p>
                                <p>As a consequence of our actions during the wars of 1971 and 1973, however, we are at this point perceived to be (a) capable of rapidly introducing, and sustaining, superior naval forces in the Indian Ocean; and (b) ready to deploy such forces in response to conflict or crisis involving disparate levels of US interest.</p>
                                <p>The Administration's proposal in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 Defense Supplemental budget request for funds to upgrade Diego Garcia to a naval and air support facility, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName>'s statements that our deployments to the Indian Ocean will become “more regular and more frequent”, reinforce the impression among littorals and others that we are considering a permanent increase in our force levels in that region in response both to an increase in Soviet activity there and to growing dependence on Persian Gulf oil.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>Assessing the scale of Soviet naval activity in the Indian Ocean depends on criteria used, and there are considerable areas of disagreement. In terms of ship-days per year, including all types, Soviet activity rose from 4,936 in 1970 to 8,904 in 1973. Allowing for heavier Soviet reliance on naval ships for support, and for the temporary increase resulting from port clearance operations at Chittagong since 1972, the indicators show Soviet naval presence to have increased on a more moderate, but still significant, scale. The bar graph at fig. 1 shows Soviet deployments, by type, since 1968.</p>
                                <p>Soviet activity has been highly responsive to regional developments and our own deployments. The Indo-Pakistan war in 1971, and the Enterprise mission, brought on a Soviet naval surge. They responded to the Middle East war and the arrival of the Hancock Task Group in late October 1973 by almost doubling the number of warships in the area, and by December 1 had as many combatants in the Indian Ocean as we did (albeit with inferior total firepower).</p>
                                <p>At the end of April 1974 Soviet combatant naval presence, somewhat reduced from crisis levels, stood at one guided missile cruiser, two diesel attack submarines, a destroyer, a destroyer escort, an LST, two minesweepers, and sixteen auxiliaries (including six at Chittagong for harbor clearance).</p>
                                <p>Views in the intelligence community differ on the extent of Soviet access to, and use of, shore facilities on the Indian Ocean littoral to support their naval deployments.</p>
                                <p>There is general agreement that in addition to the several anchorages they have established, the Soviets use, or have used, port facilities at Aden, Berbera, and Umm Qasr, and are assisting in airfield improvement at Berbera and Mogadiscio.</p>
                                <p>OJCS believes that Soviet access to ship repair, resupply, and communications facilities in the region provides them with flexibility not currently available to the US in the area.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> believes, on the other hand, that the Soviets have continuous access only to the austere facilities at Berbera, Somalia. They point out that the Soviets have no access to <pb n="10" xml:id="d77-10" facs="d77-10"/>shore-based ship repair facilities. Soviet support ships take on supplies at Aden and their warships make occasional visits to the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr but, in general, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> believes the Soviet Navy has problems of logistics, ship repair, crew rest, and communications similar to those of US naval forces in the Indian Ocean. Moreover, when considering the shore facilities potentially available to either navy in a crisis, the Soviets appear to be at a relative disadvantage to the US forces.</p>
                                <p>(However one assesses the relative basing positions, it is clear that if we lose access to Bahrain, and are not able to proceed with upgrading Diego Garcia to a support facility, we will have very serious problems in maintaining a permanent presence of any level. The Soviets under these circumstances would be at a considerable advantage.)</p>
                                <p>There is agreement that the Soviets lack necessary regional base facilities to mount a program of air surveillance to accompany their naval deployments. They have no air support capability in the littoral at present, although their intentions with regard to airfields in Somalia are not yet clear. The first of the new Soviet ASW carriers, which will probably operate chiefly in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, will become operative in 1975 or 1976. They will give the Soviets a very limited air support capability they could deploy to the Indian Ocean in a crisis, albeit one markedly inferior in a strike role to that of a USN attack carrier.</p>

                                    <hi rend="underline">Prospective opening of the Suez Canal</hi>
                                </p>
                                <p>SNIE 30-74 (February 21, 1974) concluded that even though opening of the Canal would enhance Soviet flexibility, it would not by itself precipitate a major change in the size of the continuous Soviet naval presence. Available intelligence indicates little about Soviet intentions, as opposed to Suez to increase their Indian Ocean presence that the Canal route would make it easier than it now is for the Soviets to deploy and support ships from the Mediterranean and Black Sea, and in effect would remove the advantage we now enjoy through our “surge” capacity from the Pacific.</p>
                                <p>The SNIE concluded further — like previous assessments — that whether or not the Canal is reopened, the Soviet Union is likely to increase gradually its continuous naval deployments in the Indian Ocean, reaching a level (for illustrative <pb n="11" xml:id="d77-11" facs="d77-11"/>purposes) of eight to twelve surface combatants in 1976-77. The SNIE made the further points that with or without the opening of Suez, a substantial increase in US naval presence over pre-October 1973 levels would likely produce a Soviet buildup faster and larger than the above; and that an accelerated buildup would require the Soviets to re-order their priorities and shift naval forces from other areas. Neither of the last two points is substantially affected by the prospect of a re-opened Canal.</p>
                                <p>These limited conclusions remain valid, on the assumption that the Soviets have not yet determined whether our post-October 1973 presence represents a permanent increase or a temporary surge, and are presently in a “wait-and-see” posture.</p>
                                <p>Prospective opening of the Canal, and the putative advantage it would give the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, has generated some discussion (e.g., by Senator Jackson) of an agreement to “demilitarize” the Canal by limiting, or prohibiting entirely, passage of warships. This step could he taken either informally, as an understanding with the Soviets, or proposed formally.</p>
                                <p>A formal proposal would raise numerous political and legal problems involving revision of the Constantinople Convention of 1888, and does not merit further consideration.</p>
                                <p>Advantages of a private bilateral approach to Moscow include (1) inhibiting Soviet deployments to the Indian Ocean, to the extent that they would be facilitated by opening the Canal, (2) avoiding US/Soviet confrontation in the Eastern Mediterranean if during a crisis both sought simultaneously to reinforce their deployments through the Canal. The proposal has serious disadvantages at the outset, however: 1) it appears to be directed mainly at Soviet capabilities, and thus to be of unilateral advantage to the US. If not related to a larger naval restraint package, it would for these reasons have little acceptability to Moscow; 2) as a precedent for the Straits of Malacca (and perhaps eventually the Panama Canal), it could be damaging to our interests; and 3) we may in the future wish to use the Suez Canal for Indian Ocean deployments.</p>
                                <pb n="12" xml:id="d77-12" facs="d77-12"/>
                                <p>Broadly speaking, then, the opening of the Suez Canal will effect marginal shifts in the relative military positions of the outside players, but will probably not produce major changes in relative power positions in the Indian Ocean.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>Our permanent presence in the Indian Ocean, i.e., the three ships of MIDEASTFOR, has remained at virtually static levels since the earlier studies. Including transits and the two crisis deployments discussed above our average number of ships of all types per year has risen from 4.8 in 1970 to 6.9 in 1973 (as compared to a 1973 average of about six Soviet warships and fifteen support vessels). Apart from Bahrain and Diego Garcia, we have made no efforts to secure regular access to shore-based facilities in the area. To support crisis deployments, in addition to Diego Garcia, we used U-Tapao and Bandar Abbas in 1973-74. We have no agreement with the Thai on use of U-Tapao for Indian Ocean operations, and to consider our facilities there as directly relating to the Indian Ocean would require explicit endorsement from the RTG. The Thai are very unlikely to grant it, either under the present interim government or any likely civilian successor. A military government would probably demand additional military assistance or other quid in return.</p>
                                <p>In the case of Iran, Bandar Abbas was made available to us on a severly restricted basis. It is unlikely that the SHAH would give us long-term rights that would appear to be potentially directed against the Arabs in the context of the Arab-Israeli conflict, or against Persian Gulf oil producing states in the context of deterring future actions to embargo oil shipments to the West. It is doubtful that Iran would allow a US naval base of any kind on its coast.</p>
                                <p>Our expanded facility at Diego Garcia will also rely in some part on our facilities at Subic Bay in the Philippines for logistics, repair, maintenance, and general support. While the Philippine Government has not manifested much interest in the Indian Ocean area, it does rely for its petroleum supply on the Middle East. Littoral or nonaligned states could attempt to influence the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to restrict the use of Subic to prohibit support of US naval forces involved in particular operations in the Indian Ocean. Such pressure would probably not be wholly effective, but it would cause <pb n="13" xml:id="d77-13" facs="d77-13"/>difficulties for the Philippine Government, and indirectly for the US, if such pressure was initiated or actively supported by major petroleum suppliers to the Philippines.</p>

                                <p>Any reconsideration of our Indian Ocean strategy should take into account existing proposals to limit great power military rivalry in the area. The littoral states themselves have shown considerable support for a “Zone of Peace” (IOZP) proposal initiated by Sri Lanka and adopted by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly in December 1971 Assembly (and adopted each year since then). It calls on great powers to consult with the littoral states to halt escalation of their military presence, and eliminate bases and other facilities, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction “conceived in the context of great power rivalry”. It also calls for consultations to ensure that warships and military aircraft do not use the area to threaten littoral and hinterland states. Otherwise, “the right to free and unimpeded use of the zone by the vessels of all nations” would be unaffected.</p>
                                <p>We, and most non-Asian maritime states (including the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>), have abstained from voting on the proposal. We oppose the principle of regional states establishing a special regime for any portion of the high seas, on grounds it could prejudice the forthcoming Law of the Sea Conference, would probably create similar pressures for similar regimes elsewhere, and that it conflicts with our security interests.</p>
                                <p>The Soviets have also raised the issue. The most recent official public statement of Soviet policy toward arms control measures in the Indian Ocean was contained in the communique of the BREZHNEV November 1973 visit to India, which states: “The two parties reaffirm their readiness to take part together with all interested states on an equal basis in the search for a favorable solution to the question of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace”. In a June 1971 speech, BREZHNEV referred to the broader context of “great powers … cruising far from their own shores,” and said the Soviets were prepared to solve the problem “on an equal basis”. The Soviets have, however, consistently abstained on IOZP proposal votes in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and have been careful in media discussion to include statements of the need to avoid limitations on freedom of navigation.</p>
                                <pb n="14" xml:id="d77-14" facs="d77-14"/>
                                <p>On the narrower question of US-Soviet mutual restraint, Ambassador Dobrynin in March 1971 proposed to Secretary ROGERS the possibility of a joint declaration to keep the Indian Ocean free of major power competition. The following July Ambassador Beam in Moscow told Foreign Minister GROMYKO we agreed “in principle with the proposition that it would be in our mutual interest to avoid military competition” in the Indian Ocean, and asked for clarification of the Soviet position. The request was not answered. In February 1974 USA Institute Director Arbatov informally suggested to visiting Americans that the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should get together on Indian Ocean naval limitations, and recently a Soviet Embassy official in Washington initiated low-level discussions probing Congressional testimony references to the possibility of some bilateral agreement. At the same time, however, the Soviets have been unresponsive to suggestions from India and Australia that they pursue mutual restraint bilaterally with the US.</p>
                                <p>A US-Soviet agreement that reduced visible great-power military presence in the Indian Ocean would probably be greeted enthusiastically by the littorals. The IOZP proposal complicates the issue, however. Any mutual restraint agreement could be construed as a victory for the “nonaligned” vis-à-vis the great powers, and thus could have repercussions elsewhere unless clearly set in the US-Soviet context.<note n="*" target="d77fn*">The Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>/IPMG notes that after this study had been approved by the Interdepartmental Group, differences came to light within the Department of State over whether, and to what degree, we should respond to littoral state demands for exclusion of non-regional forces from the Ocean, and whether setting restraints on military activity in the Indian Ocean could set a precedent that might eventually limit our flexibility elsewhere.

                                        <p>Apart from our new dependence on Middle East oil — an important exception — the conclusions of the earlier studies, that our interests in the Indian Ocean area are moderate but not vital or extensive, are borne out by subsequent events. US interests can be discussed under five broad headings:
<list>
                                                <label>1.</label>
                                                <item>Persian Gulf oil. The US is faced with a growing dependence on Middle East oil, transported from the Persian Gulf via the Indian Ocean. The implications of this fact for our Indian Ocean force posture are subject to considerable interagency disagreement. Broadly, the two views are:
<list>
                                                        <label>a)</label>

                                                            <p>The principal threats to our supply of oil from the Middle East, and that of Western Europe and Japan, are economic (e.g., pricing) and political (e.g., another embargo for Arab purposes). In the long term our national energy policies, the success of our diplomatic efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict and strengthen moderate Arab forces, and our ability to establish mutually satisfactory and interdependent trade and investment relationships with key states like Iran and Saudi Arabia, will decisively influence our need for and access to Middle East oil. In this view, our naval force posture in the Indian Ocean will only marginally influence our access to petroleum as long as the Soviets do not achieve a position of overwhelming military predominance. The tanker routes leading from the Persian Gulf are indisputably vulnerable, but there is no evidence pointing to a Soviet strategy of cutting off Western oil supplies using the Persian Gulf as a chokepoint. Moscow, to enhance its own Middle East position, encouraged the Arabs in their use of oil as a weapon to prevent the West from supporting Israel in the 1973 war, and they could support another oil embargo in the future. At the same time, Soviet naval forces were careful not to get too close to the Persian Gulf during the crisis.</p>

                                                            <p>Military interdiction could still be a threat in the sense that the Soviets may have, or be able to develop, a force posture that would enable them to interdict the sea lines of communication through the Indian Ocean. In analyzing this problem, several points are worth emphasizing:
<list>
                                                                    <item>— Interdiction of international sea lines of communication is a step that is highly unlikely to be undertaken by the Soviets directly except in a very serious confrontation or crisis.</item>
                                                                    <item>— In the event of such a crisis, the Soviets cannot be confident that the US (and its allies, if they were involved) would or could attempt to deal with the interdiction problem locally in the Indian Ocean. At the very least, the Soviets would have to assume a high risk of escalation to a war at sea, in addition to whatever risks of conflict were inherent in the original crisis.</item>
                                                                    <item>— Deterrence of a Soviet interdiction effort, therefore, does not rely solely on our Indian Ocean capability but rests very heavily on our general military strength and security policies worldwide. Even an enlarged US peacetime presence in the Indian Ocean would still be surrogate for those broader capabilities and might not, in and of itself, be able to deal with and thus deter a determined interdiction campaign.</item>
                                                                </list>
                                                            </p>
                                                            <p>In this broad view of the oil problem, there is considerable justification for a US force on a relatively limited scale. In support of our diplomatic and economic efforts with the Arab states and Iran we have an interest in maintaining our visibility and presence in the Arabian Sea area, and military deployments can assist in maintaining visibility. A local US force can also help deter lesser threats to the sea routes, e.g., from a small state or radical faction bent on exploiting the vulnerability of the tankers for its own, unrelated, purpose. Faced with challenges by the littorals to our right to navigate the Ocean, and in the absence of agreements on restraint, we should probably maintain some force level to preserve our contingency access.</p>

                                                            <p>An alternate view of the relationship of oil to our Indian Ocean strategy argues that our energy requirements, and the threat of another Arab oil embargo, require us to establish an Indian Ocean regional military presence adequate to deter Soviet threats to our lines of communication and to encourage regional stability throughout the Persian Gulf and adjacent areas. Soviet military presence, in this analysis, supports overall Soviet foreign policy objectives directly, and is part of an effort to assume control of the oil-rich nations. Proponents of this view argue that recent expressions of Soviet military doctrine, especially a series of articles by Soviet Navy Commander Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, taken together with a Soviet naval program which has projected the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to prominence as a major naval power, prove that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is formulating a new, activist naval policy in pursuit of global interests. Unchallenged Soviet military activity in the Arabian Sea, including threats against local governments, could eventually lead to Soviet hegemony over the entire region.</p>
                                                            <p>The threat of Soviet dominance, supported by Soviet willingness to maintain the necessary force posture, requires us, in this view, to use political, economic, and military means to demonstrate our resolve, reduce tensions, and maintain stability in the Indian Ocean littoral. Our general war nuclear deterrent does not itself achieve this purpose, because it is not credible where the stakes are something less than national survival. We would be remiss in not establishing a force presence in the Indian Ocean capable of deterring Soviet threats.</p>

The October war demonstrated how our support or Israel can be in the face of allied unwillingness to permit us to use their bases for the purpose. As an alternative route for peacetime access and surveillance, and for supply operations if hostilities are renewed, an Indian Ocean staging capability could be seen as a useful adjunct. A resupply effort on the scale of 1973 during renewed fighting, however, using Diego Garcia and the Red Sea route, would be longer, more dangerous, and logistically more complex than the Mediterranean route. <pb n="18" xml:id="d77-18" facs="d77-18"/>Diego Garcia is more than 3,000 nm from Tel Aviv, and overflight rights for military resupply of Israel during renewed hostilities would not likely be granted by any of the Arab states. The path through the Red Sea and into the Gulf of Aqaba passes through claimed Arab air space and could be used only with a high risk of engagement in the event of hostilities. We will still have to depend on shore facilities, particularly if protection is required for forces or material moving through or over the Indian Ocean (e.g., Bandar Abbas for ASW flights). We would thus not be entirely freed of the restraints imposed by views of littoral powers.</item>

                                                <item>Global balance with the Soviets. We have a broad interest in not ceding a preponderant military position to the Soviets in the Indian Ocean, and have justified our recent deployments there in part as a response to the rise in Soviet activities. The Soviet naval buildup, and Indian Ocean presence, are intended in part to further the image of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as a global military power able at least to hold its own with the US. Even allies (like Australia) publicly critical of our actions concede privately that Soviet pretensions require same response most littoral states have no wish to see the area become a Soviet sphere of influence. The problem is to define the level of US and allied force necessary to balance the Soviet presence, acknowledging that force matching of the Soviets in the Indian Ocean itself is only one possible course of action open to us to fulfill political and security objectives in the area. Our Pacific (and with Suez open, Mediterranean) fleets are within augmentation range under many foreseeable contingencies, and must be factored into the calculations of the Soviets and littoral states. Apart from the British and French, local navies — Iranian, and even Indian —should also be taken into account. In this respect the Indian Ocean is not analogous to a true “power vacuum”, such as Antarctica or the seabeds.</item>

Previous studies have pointed out that while we do not now deploy SSBNs to the Indian Ocean, a breakthrough in Soviet ASW capabilities, constraints on SSBNs elsewhere in the future, or other considerations could make this important to us. Our scientific, monitoring, and communications facilities, while important, are not highly visible, and are under no particular threat.</item>

Aside from energy and other Persian Gulf resources, our interests in the states bordering the Indian Ocean are limited. At one time we believed ourselves to be in unrelenting competition with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for power and influence in the underdeveloped world. We felt this nowhere more keenly than in the Indian Ocean area, particularly the subcontinent, where US-Soviet competition was treated as a zero-sum game. In the early 1970's we acknowledged, in effect, that our interests did not demand, and our assets would not underwrite, an effort to thwart Soviet progress everywhere in the Third World. Detente made it easier for us to set priorities and accept Soviet influence in parts of the Indian Ocean as non-threatening. In the subcontinent, without being explicit, we have indicated that we have no problem with the present Indo-Soviet relationship so long as our broad relations with the subcontinent — predominantly humanitarian and commercial — can develop on a mature basis. Where the Soviets have their own troubles, as in Sri Lanka, we do not try to exploit them to compensate for Soviet gains elsewhere.</p>
                                                    <p>(Some <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> participants disagree with this view, and believe that the Indian Ocean littoral states are targets for hostile influence, with the single greatest hostile influence being the Soviet Union. They consider that the Soviets would not hesitate to use military power, or the threat of such power, to achieve their goals in the area were there no countervailing power. Our interest lies in checking unrestrained use of Soviet military power, and in demonstrating to the littoral states that there is an alternative to Soviet influence, dominance, and control. For example, we do not want Ethiopia just because the Soviets have Somalia. But we do want Somalia to have the option of dismissing the Soviets (a la Egypt), and we do not want the Soviets to be able to apply unrestrained military pressure on Somalia (or Yemen, or Iraq, or any other littoral nation). In addition we would like, to whatever degree our presence and other circumstances permit, to limit hostility and conflicts between the states of the region. Finally, recognizing the dynamic environment that characterizes the area, the US must be able to respond politically, economically, and militarily to the challenge which may arise in the future.)</p>
                                                    <p>Besides trade and investment, we are interested in the support of littoral countries on important issues like narcotics control and Law of the Sea in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and other <pb n="20" xml:id="d77-20" facs="d77-20"/>multilateral fora. These countries take positions based on the politics of nonalignment, their own interests, and our bilateral relations, rather than our Indian Ocean force presence.</p>

                                        <p>The Soviets have no vital interest in the region comparable to the dependence of the West and Japan on Middle East energy supplies. The Indian Ocean is close to Soviet Asia, as well as to the Middle East, and is thus intrinsically important, but secondary to European seas, the Mediterranean, and Northeast Asia in terms of Soviet interests. To circumscribe the influence of China, and to create an image of equality with the US, the Soviets have sought through a broad range of programs to gain a voice in regional political affairs.</p>
                                        <p>Major Soviet efforts, including almost half its total aid disbursements since 1954, have been directed at a few countries in the subcontinent and Middle East. (Total Soviet aid, in contrast to ours, has stressed arms transfers ever economic assistance). Aims sales and treaty relationships also supplement diplomatic initiatives. The Soviets enjoy positions of some political influence in Iraq, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Somalia, India, and Bangladesh. Their interests in the first two relate to their larger ambitions in the Middle East; in Somalia they have had, since 1969, a foothold for broader efforts on the African continent besides use of the port at Berbera; in India they seek an Asian counterweight to the PRC, and still make efforts to secure base rights (unsuccessfully to date). Past efforts have engaged Soviet prestige, created client state relationships, and provided some economic benefits through aid-related trade agreements. Client-patron ties are likely to chafe in time, however. Moscow may have second thoughts about the advantages of intimate ties to resource-starved “soft states” like India and Bangladesh, particularly since the Chinese have made no determined effort recently to assert a forward position in competition with the Soviets. Littoral state wariness of Soviet intentions and limits on Soviet economic and military aid resources also constrain their expansion into new areas.</p>
                                        <p>From the standpoint of strategic military considerations, Soviet planners probably view the Indian Ocean in the context of (a) a potential threat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> from US SLBMs; and <pb n="21" xml:id="d77-21" facs="d77-21"/>(b) possible US military action involving carrier air forces against Soviet client states, which could raise demands for Soviet involvement. (The potential strategic threat to oil was discussed above [II B]). Regarding the strategic nuclear threat, the Soviets probably recognize they have virtually no chance of effective countermeasures even with a major augmentation of their Indian Ocean fleet. This threat may nonetheless account to some degree for Soviet area familiarization and military intelligence gathering activities. Soviet naval combatant presence does not appear to be designed for local intervention, and would probably not be decisive in a significant regional conflict. It is likely the Soviets regard their naval force, as we do, as a symbol of political interest backing up other policy instruments, and an assertion on of intent to maintain access to the area.</p>
                                        <p>(There are alternative views of Soviet Indian Ocean policy, which stress that any major objective of the Soviets is to establish a position of power and military presence that would enable them to control, disrupt, or deny Free World access to oil, as well as pressuring other states to work against US interests).</p>
                                        <p>The sea lines of communication to and through the Indian Ocean are useful to the Soviets, but not essential from an economic standpoint, as only a fraction of foreign-bound cargos and domestic Soviet freight passes this way. The prospective opening of the Suez Canal, current Soviet efforts to expand commerce with Southeast Asia, and the possibility of a revived oil trade out of the Black Sea all enhance the potential importance of sea routes through the Indian Ocean for the Soviets, however.</p>
                                        <p>Soviet activities in oceanographic research, fishing, space programs, and intelligence are important but not crucial.</p>

                                        <p>The previous <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> studies placed considerable emphasis on other outside military presence and on the possibility of US collaboration with allied forces. Intervening history suggests that British and French deployments do not relate to major regional interests; that the Australians are unlikely to join us in Indian Ocean patrols and task group <pb n="22" xml:id="d77-22" facs="d77-22"/>deployments; and that Japan, rather than being an open and willing supporter of our Indian Ocean presence, would regard use of Japanese bases for naval activity there with reservation.</p>
                                        <p>The British maintain loose Commonwealth ties with much of the littoral, but their economic interests are declining. They have based no ships in the Indian Ocean since their Far East Command was abolished in November 1971. They do maintain a modest naval presence through rotational deployments, as well as operating facilities at Gan and other Indian Ocean locations. The Indian Ocean policy of the new Labor government is not yet clear: any changes would probably be in the direction of diminishing the UK role. The British government has concurred in our plans for using Diego Garcia as a support base, subject to final approval by the new government, but has insisted that we consult on operations from Diego Garcia in “other than normal circumstances”. They have also asked that we not publicly relate our activities there to our Persian Gulf/Middle East interests.</p>
                                        <p>The French Indian Ocean force is one of the largest non-regional. military presences in the Indian Ocean. It currently includes eight surface combatants, including deployment on a training mission of a Cruiser/Helicopter Carrier able to carry 700 troops. With troops and aircraft at Djibouti, as well as shore facilities, and troops also stationed on Reunion Island, France might appear to be signaling major interests. The French presence, however, comprises the residue of a colonial empire that once included numerous small enclaves on the Indian Ocean littoral. France's drawdown of colonial-related forces since World War II has been orchestrated slowly, for image purposes, rather than responding promptly to budgetary stringency and decline of influence, as the British did. Despite the establishment of a French Indian Ocean command in 1973, French naval deployments should probably be regarded, like the “force de frappe”, as primarily symbolic to enhance France's image as a world power able to play an independent global role.</p>
                                        <p>Australia has looked to East Asia rather than the Indian Ocean, apart from tentative moves by Prime Minister Whitlam since 1972 to establish a regional understanding with India. Even if Whitlam is succeeded by a Liberal-Country Party <pb n="23" xml:id="d77-23" facs="d77-23"/>government, Australia is unlikely to follow our lead to the extent of contributing forces to a combined Indian Ocean presence, at least one that was directed at the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. We would probably have a greater chance of using Australian naval bases if the Opposition gains power, however. Australia's trade and investment interests still lie north and west, apart from energy.</p>
                                        <p>Japan is heavily dependent on oil from the Persian Gulf. As a consequence of Arab pressure in 1973, Tokyo felt compelled to revise its Middle East policies and adopt a somewhat more pro-Arab stance, rather than continue to support <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> resolution 242 without qualification. The decision was probably inevitable, since no alternative sources of oil were available to avert the crushing economic effects to Japan of resisting Arab pressures. As a result of this experience, Japan would be extremely sensitive to Arab charges that it was actively facilitating a US naval presence directed toward the Middle East. The possibility of Japan actually “showing the flag” with ships of its own west of Singapore, raised in an earlier paper, now seems remote, both in light of Japan's tenuous acceptability in Southeast Asia and its acknowledgment that it cannot conceivably protect its tanker routes with naval forces.</p>
                                        <p>Peking has continued to demonstrate concern over the expansion of Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean. As a result of this concern the PRC has indirectly indicated its understanding of US/UK plans to expand Diego Garcia. Peking also supports the proposal for a “zone of peace”. The Chinese have not yet shown any significant interest in their own use of the Indian Ocean. It is possible they may one day use the region for missile tests, and they could eventually deploy naval ships there.</p>

                                        <p>Littoral states' interests The earlier studies emphasized, and it is worth stressing again, that the Indian Ocean is not an integral region. India and Pakistan, and their smaller neighbors, together form a subregional power nexus. India is well on the way to consolidating its dominance therein, but apprehension in earlier studies that India would project itself further afield in Southeast Asia, for instance — now seems less real. The other major littoral areas look primarily in other directions, toward Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Basin. To consider Malaysia, Indonesia, and Australia, for example, as primarily Indian Ocean powers would be to distort political realities. The same is true for East Africa.</p>

                                        <p>Insofar as one can generalize about littoral state interests, most can be covered under one of the following headings:

Nationalism is a powerful force in most of the region, and reactions against presumed meddling by the great powers are automatic and emotional. The Soviets suffer less from this syndrome than we do, but there is a growing tendency to identify even the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with the other “imperialists” at gatherings of the “nonaligned”. The other side of the coin is fear of great power dominance, and many of those calling for a “zone of peace” would be alarmed by a unilateral US pullout that left the Soviets free to do what they wish. If great power absence is impossible, balance is the next best thing.</item>

                                                <item>Technology and resources for development. Foreign assistance is still sought by most of the countries bordering the Indian Ocean. The region encompasses, in Bangladesh and India, the world crisis of population and resources in its severest form. Thus while the security presence of outsiders is not desired, access to the industrial nations for aid, trade, and investment will become even more important for most littoral countries in the future. Because of its enormous economic power and the drive to modernize begun in the 1950's by the SHAH, Iran presents a unique case. Iran clearly perceives for itself a need to project forces far enough into the Arabian Sea and adjacent areas to handle its own security problems, and is acquiring the military means to do so. An aid-giving, militarily powerful Iran may someday compete with India for influence in the Indian Ocean area in much the same way we and the Soviets have been portrayed as competing in the past. <pb n="25" xml:id="d77-25" facs="d77-25"/>(Iran's military purchases announced in 1973 immediately aroused fears in New Delhi, couched in terms of possible Iranian help for Pakistan hut probably relating equally to fears of broader competition.

                                        <p>The radical regimes bordering on the Indian Ocean and the white and colonial governments of southern Africa have an interest in selective encouragement of involvement by outside powers, for narrow and obviously quite different ends of their own. In the former case, the Soviets have been able to acquire access to useful military facilities in Somalia. South Africa, on the other hand, would welcome US dependence on its facilities and the implied legitimacy it would lend to its national policies.</p>

                                        </p>
                                        <p>Despite great disparity in their approach to security problems, the littorals show surprising consensus about great-power naval rivalry in “their” ocean. Twenty-two out of 26 have voted in favor of the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace (IOZP) resolution at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for the past two years; only Portugal Mozambique), South Africa and Oman joined the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in abstaining. (The Maldives were absent.) For the vast majority the danger is perceived not in terms of a specific threat to their own security, but in terms of prospect of a heightened level of tension in the area.</p>
                                        <p>The range of littoral attitudes is best illustrated by reactions to the proposed expansion of US military facilities at Diego Garcia. Fourteen littorals have already taken an official public position opposing the American decision, and many of the rest are also unsympathetic. India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh all termed the proposal a “retrograde step” that violate the wishes of the littorals. Sri Lanka sent a letter to the President expressing concern, but took a low public posture. India has publicly criticized the proposal in strong terms. New Delhi and Colombo might pursue their opposition in international forums, though neither state wishes to employ tactics which will unduly antagonize the US. (All three have probably muted their criticism because of food shortages that might oblige them to seek US assistance.)</p>
                                        <pb n="26" xml:id="d77-26" facs="d77-26"/>
                                        <p>Malaysia and Indonesia are strong adherents of the Southeast Asian neutrality proposal as well as the IOZP. Malaysia's reaction was milder than expected, but Indonesia's was surprisingly strong; President Suharto said publicly the decision to upgrade Diego was against the wishes of the Indonesian people. Thailand expressed concern, and official Thai opposition has increased steadily since our announcement.</p>
                                        <p>Tanzania's strong opposition derives from militant non-alignment, and from fear of possible US intervention in the event of heightened African conflict with the Portuguese in Mozambique. Tanzania has recently begun to criticize Soviet as well as US naval presence. The Malagasy Republic and Mauritius, because of relations with their neighbors and the nonaligned, both denounced the proposal.</p>
                                        <p>The Australian and New Zealand governments were mildly critical of the US plan. Australian Prime Minister Whitlam, while personally critical of the proposal, is faced with a strong endorsement of it by the opposition party as well as general Australian sympathy for the US. The Australian government assured us privately that, despite its efforts to improve its position in the Third World and the pressures from the ruling party's left wing, the Diego Garcia issue could be handled to the “basic satisfaction” of the US.</p>
                                        <p>Privately, the governments of South Africa, Singapore, Pakistan, and Iran have expressed approval. Singapore supports the IOZP proposal in principle but has concluded that regional security depends on a US naval presence to balance that of the Soviet Union. However, Singapore is unwilling to stand publicly at odds with Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
                                        <p>Pakistan has privately supported the concept of an expanded US naval presence and has made a standing offer of naval facilities on the Makran coast — acceptance of which would again destabilize the subcontinent. At the same time, Pakistan is seeking to develop a more independent security posture based on ties to the Third World, particularly the Arabs.</p>
                                        <p>A degree of tacit approval can probably be anticipated from Portuguese Mozambique, Yemen, Ethiopia, and Oman. Sudan and Somalia are likely to be negative in the absence of a significant change in US relations with them and Ethiopia. <pb n="27" xml:id="d77-27" facs="d77-27"/>Burma's government-controlled press has given apparently deliberate prominence to criticism, and the Maldives are likely to be negative. Saudi Arabia's generally pro-West and anti-Soviet posture would place it in the positive category, but the possibility of US intervention to assure access to Arab oil requires all the Arab states to regard a US naval presence with some suspicion.</p>

                        <p>The foregoing discussion indicates that while there is general agreement on the level of our interests in the Indian Ocean, there is substantial disagreement over the degree to which they are threatened by developments there. Two broad areas of policy choice emerge:

                                <item>In the light of events since 1971 — Soviet naval buildup, realignment of power in the subcontinent, littoral state reactions, our own naval responses, and above all the shifts in perceptions caused by the October 1973 war and our increasing reliance on Middle East oil — do our interests require us to adjust our posture, including an increase in our force presence, in the Indian Ocean?</item>

                                <item>Does the possibility of formal or informal arms restraint by outside powers, or simply between the US and the Soviets, offer a way of protecting our interests?

                                <item>Requirements for a significantly increased US force presence in the Indian Ocean depend largely on an interpretation of Soviet strategy in the Middle East. If we judge that the Soviets stand a reasonable chance using military pressure via the Indian Ocean, together with other means, to secure control of Persian Gulf oil, and thus to gain enormous leverage vis-à-vis the West and Japan, it becomes essential to counter the Soviet challenge. If, on the other hand, we conclude that the oil producers will formulate their policies more or less independently on the basis of their own perceived interests — including calculations of economic benefit, economic interdependence, and regional political developments, <pb n="29" xml:id="d77-29" facs="d77-29"/>predominantly the course of Arab-Israeli relations —we can continue to regard our Indian Ocean force presence as an adjunct and supplement to our broader policy efforts.</item>

                                <item>In terms solely of littoral state attitudes, a significant increase in force presence would involve political liabilities. The neutrals and our opponents would criticize us more harshly: the Soviets would gain propaganda points and a pretext for increasing their own deployments; and our friends and allies would give us covert support at best. However, as noted earlier, our interests in the littoral states apart from the oil producers are limited, and littoral state attitudes are not the most important factors we should consider.</item>

                        <p>Earlier studies covered almost every conceivable option four force levels (<gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 104), alternative policy packages contrasting arms limitation vs. balanced forces (110), and seven variations of arms control proposals (110 follow-on). This section will not attempt to describe all possible combinations of force levels and arms control measures, but rather to identify a series of feasible policy options in which arms limitation efforts are related to various force levels in protecting our interests.</p>
                        <p>Excluding as unrealistic the two ends of the force spectrum — a complete withdrawal, or the permanent basing of sizeable ground, naval, and air force units — there appear to be three broad levels of force presence available to the policy maker:
<list>

                                <item>A low level, comparable to our pre-October 1973 presence, consisting of the three ships of Mideast Force as a permanent presence, with limited additional deployments to the area for periodic exercises and goodwill visits, in addition to an active program of military assistance and sales.</item>

                                <item>A moderate level, optimized for contingencies, consisting of the above with the addition of more frequent deployments, a support facility in the region, and possible working arrangements with certain key littoral states for access rights in the event a larger force presence is required.</item>

                                <item>Tacit restraint. The US force presence would be fashioned so as to minimize the perceived need for others to respond with force increases of their own. If considered useful, unilateral statements by US spokesman indicating that our presence was not intended as a threat, and that we would exercise restraint, could reinforce this effort.</item>

                                <item>Mutual restraint. We would determine whether Moscow would be willing to join us in a declaration that we will exercise “mutual restraint” in deploying military forces to the Indian Ocean. A contingency clause could allow “surges” by, each side in unusual or threatening circumstances.</item>

                                <item>Formal agreement. We would seek a formal arms limitation agreement with the Soviets, perhaps in stages beginning with an interim freeze on force levels, followed by phased reductions to a mutually acceptable level.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Both sets of alternatives are arranged in ascending order — of economic and political cost, in the case of force levels, and cost in military and political flexibility, in the case of arms control variations. Thus, the greater the force level, the greater the potential costs in base construction) guides for basic rights is, draw down on forces elsewhere, and unfavorable reactions from some littoral states. Likewise, the more formal an arms control agreement, the greater the probability that it will impose restrictions on US freedom of action in future crises, and establish precedents that could limit our flexibility elsewhere.</p>

We would retain MIDEASTFOR at Bahrain if possible, otherwise seek an alternative that would permit us to retain a similar level of permanent presence; occasionally participate in combined regional exercises; and, monitor Soviet activities closely. Military assistance and sales programs in the region, especially in Iran and Saudi Arabia, would be continued.</p>
                        <p>Deployment of such limited forces in the Indian Ocean would in itself signal clearly our intent to exercise restraint. We could, in addition, accompany this policy by public or private assurances stressing our restraint. We would hope that these measures would persuade the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to limit its force deployments essentially to pre-October 1973 levels, and persuade littoral and other nations that our posture was intended to avoid great power competition.</p>

Criticism from some of the littoral states would diminish.</item>
                                <item>— Economic costs of our force presence would be minimized, while operational access would be preserved.</item>

                            <hi rend="underline">Sub-Option B1: Contingency presence with tacit restraint</hi>. As in Alternative A we would make clear that our policy was a restrained one, limited essentially to contingency support and periodic exercise of access rights to the Indian Ocean. However, since it would involve a force presence noticeably greater than that maintained prior to October 1973, same increase in Soviet force levels would probably have to be accepted in the process of arriving at a mutually acceptable “balance”. Littoral states could be expected to continue to object to such a policy at least until it was established over time that an escalatory spiral had not been set in motion.</p>

                                <item>— Soviet forces might grow to higher levels, with Moscow justifying the increase in terms of our own higher presence.</item>
                                <item>— If tacit restraint were established in the public mind, it would be politically more difficult to “surge” in contingencies, even though we had the support structure for doing so.</item>

                        <p>Sub-Option B2: Contingency presence with mutual restraint. Alternatively, the same level of force presence could be linked to a declaration of mutual restraint by the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This possibility could be raised privately with the Soviets on the basis of their earlier suggestion that we agree not to compete in the Indian Ocean. A formal announcement would commit each side to exercise restraint and avoid actions that would give rise to competition in naval or other forces. It could call on other states to join in exercising restraint. A contingency clause could provide for “surges” by either side in unusual circumstances. If the Soviets declined to consider the proposal we would let it drop without further reference or public comment at the time.</p>
                        <p>(NOTE: Without a definition of what “mutual restraint” would entail, it would be impossible to determine whether or not restraint is being observed. Depending on what it is agreed to restrain, a number of questions would bear on determining compliance in the absence of a formal agreement, e.g., how precisely should permanent deployments be defined? How is loitering distinguished from transit? What time <pb n="35" xml:id="d77-35" facs="d77-35"/>restrictions, if any, should be placed on surges of naval forces? That is a base? Possibilities include setting an upper limit on surface warships but excluding submarines and support vessels, establishing time limitations for transit and surges, and defining bases practically as having facilities necessary to support warships and being readily accessible to US and Soviet naval forces. This problem and its implication for policy choice are covered in detail in the February 15, 1972 interagency study, Non—Strategic Naval Limitations in the Indian Ocean, which will be redistributed for reference).</p>

                                <item>— Unless carefully defined, a “mutual restraint” declaration could be subject to different interpretations and thus become a source for recrimination between us and the Soviets, or the littorals.</item>
                                <item>— We would be more constrained than in B1 from actually exercising our contingency option: if it were not clearly covered by the “escape clause”, it would be subject to criticism.</item>

                        <p>Alternative C: Any force level, combined with a formal arms limitation agreement. The mechanism of a formal arms control agreement could permit the US to establish whatever <pb n="36" xml:id="d77-36" facs="d77-36"/>level of military presence was felt necessary to preserve our interests and ratify it by formal agreement. In this scenario, the initial level of force presence would be established at the level we judged necessary to protect our interests, and we would then propose a formal agreement to Moscow. The level of forces could be used as a bargaining lever in the attempt to establish a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>
                        <p>Since this arms control strategy would be formulated as a means of protecting security interests, it should he formal and explicit about the numbers and types of military forces and, if desired, bases involved. If agreement were reached, we could maintain a visible, vigorous military presence within the prescribed limits. The strategy could be designed to facilitate a permanent increase in our force presence, if it failed, minimizing the political costs by dealing in advance with both domestic and littoral demands for arms control. Thus, if the Soviets declined to consider a formal agreement, delayed beyond a reasonable point to discuss specifics, or appeared to he using the time to strengthen their position, we could — if we judged it necessary — publicly announce that we had sought without success to limit great power rivalry in the Indian Ocean, but were compelled by Soviet intransigence to proceed to establish a force level independently to protect vital interests.</p>
                        <p>(An alternative way of proceeding with this option would be to cast it primarily in terms of US-Soviet relations, and only secondarily in terms of our Indian Ocean interests. The advantages and disadvantages would be basically the same, but more value would be attached to the gains for detente. Tactics might differ. We might, for instance, propose a formal agreement to Moscow before deciding on a force level and base our decision on their response. We could he inclined to make greater concessions in the size of our permanent presence. We would probably not publicize our arms control effort if it did not succeed, unless this appeared likely to cause the Soviets to be more forthcoming. In the interim, we could retain our current presence, and might orchestrate deployments from other areas to support our negotiating efforts).</p>

                        <p>As you know, included in this year's budget submission was a request for funding to provide for a modest expansion of the naval facility on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. The purpose of this expansion is to provide more economical support for the program of limited naval deployments in the area than would be possible if we are constrained to rely on a long supply line based in the Pacific theater. The funding ($29 million) is included in the military construction authorization bill which has passed the House. The Senate Armed services Committee reduced the figure to $18 million and added a provision that precludes any expenditure without your determination that it is in the national interest to do so. It further requires that your report to this effect must be approved by both Houses of Congress. The bill will come to the Senate floor on Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SJC2">Stennis</persName> has expressed willingness to support the proposal on the floor against efforts he anticipates will be made to reduce the funding further. He believes, however, that the strength of the opposition is such that a particularly strong effort will be necessary. In this context, he has requested a letter from you which states the Administration's rationale for the expansion.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the outcome on the Senate floor, we believe that the House conferees will strongly support the $29 million level and will also insist that there be no requirement for submitting a Presidential Determination to the Congress prior to going forward with the expansion. Nevertheless, out of respect for Senator <persName corresp="#p_SJC2">Stennis</persName>' views in this regard, it is recommended that a letter be sent to him in accordance with his wishes.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName>John</persName>:</p>
                            <p>Knowing of your personal concern for the adequacy of our defense posture, I am writing to express my views on the necessity of going forward with a modest expansion of the naval support facility on Diego Garcia.</p>
                            <p>The strategic importance of the Indian Ocean is, I believe, clear. Not only is it an important crossroads of maritime activity, but it is, as well, key to our ability to demonstrate our support for allies in the region and to protect U.S. interests there. As you know, we have maintained a military presence in the Indian Ocean for more than twenty years. In recent times, as the presence of other Western countries in the area has been altered and the resource potential of the area has become more important, we have been conducting more frequent naval deployments in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                            <p>The level of funding requested and the nature of intended improvements are in keeping with the limited character of our operations. The expenditures are further justified as measures which will shorten the length of the supply line and reduce the strains which our deployments could place on our limited logistical support resources in the Pacific. It is also important to reorganize that construction of expanded facilities on Diego Garcia does not imply a significant new increase in the U.S. military presence in the area.</p>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d79-03" facs="d79-03"/>
                            <p>I know that you recognize the importance of this proposal and am confident that I can count on your support to resist any efforts to reduce the funding to carry it out or to restrict otherwise my latitude to do so.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>1. WE APPRECIATE REFLECTIVE COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS SET FORTH IN REFTELS. AND BEFORE COMMENTING FURTHER WE WOULD LIKE TO REASSURE AMBASSADORS <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">MOYNIHAN</persName> AND KINTNER THAT OUR FUNDAMENTS HAVE NOT REMAINED INVIOLATE TO CRITICISM ON HILL AND ELSEWHERE OF OUR INDIAN OCEAN POLICY IN GENERAL AND THE PROPOSED EXPANSION PLANS FOR DIEGO GARCIA IN PARTICULAR.</p>
                        <p>2. REF A, SUPPORTED BY POINTS MADE IN REF B, CONTAIN SOME STRONG ARGUMENTS FOR DEFERRING PLANS TO DEVELOP A MODEST NAVAL LOGISTIC SUPPORT FACILITY IN DIEGO GARCIA. HOWEVER,</p>
                        <p>MATTER HAS LED US TO CONCLUDE THAT IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO POSTPONE DECISION FOR FOLLOWING REASONS:</p>
                        <p>(A) WE WERE CONSCIOUS IN JANUARY 1974 THAT THE PROPOSED DIEGO EXPANSION PLANS WOULD INEVITABLY GENERATE CRITICISM.</p>
                        <p>THE HIGH-LEVEL EXECUTIVE BRANCH DECISION TO PROCEED WITH THOSE PLANS WAS MADE ON THE JUDGMENT THAT CRITICISM, WHILE PRESENTING DIFFICULTIES HERE AND AT CERTAIN OVERSEAS POSTS, WOULD BE MANAGEABLE. SUBSEQUENT TO THIS DECISION, CONSIDERABLE CAPITAL HAS BEEN INVESTED IN THE CONGRESS, WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, AND AMONGST INDIAN OCEAN LITTORALS TO ELICIT SUPPORT OR, AT A MINIMUM, UNDERSTANDING OF OUR DIEGO EXPANSION PLANS.</p>
                        <p>(B) SINCE JANUARY WE HAVE SECURED <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO OUR DIEGO PROPOSALS AND NEGOTIATED AD REFERENDUM GOVERNMENT AND SERVICE-LEVEL AGREEMENTS TN SUPPORT OF THE PLANNED UPGRADE OF THE CURRENT NAVAL COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY AND EXPANSION OF SUPPORT FACILITIES. THE RATIONALE TO SUPPORT ENLARGING DIEGO HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF LONG HOURS OF TESTIMONY BY DEPARTMENT AND <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> WITNESSES BEFORE THE CONGRESS. WE ARE NOW AT A POINT</p>

                        <p>WHERE THE PROSPECTS SEEM REASONABLY GOOD FOR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF A BUDGETARY APPROPRIATION IN <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-75 FOR DIEGO GARCIA. THE HOUSE ON AUGUST 9 PASSED BY A VOTE OF 322-30 THE <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-75 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION BILL AFTER A MOTION TO DELETE THE DIEGO LINE ITEM WAS SOUNDLY DEFEATED. THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE ON AUGUST 22 APPROVED THE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION BILL FOR <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-75 WHICH INCLUDED 18.1 MILLION DOLLARS FOR DIEGO AS AGAINST THE 32.3 MILLION DOLLARS REQUESTED BY <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> — 29 MILLION DOLLARS CARRIED OVER FROM THE <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-74 <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> SUPPLEMENTAL PLUS 3.3 MILLION DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY PROGRAMMED IN THE <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-75 BUDGET.</p>
                        <p>(C) FOREGOING SENATE COMMITTEE ACTION, WITH ADDED AMENDMENT REQUIRING PRESIDENTIAL DETERMINATION THAT DIEGO CONSTRUCTION PLANS ARE IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST,(REF C) INSURES THAT DIEGO BUDGETARY AUTHORIZATION WILL GO TO SENATE-HOUSE CONFERENCE. GIVEN THE STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT CONFEREES WILL COMPROMISE ON A FIGURE BETWEEN HOUSE AND SENATE VERSIONS OF AUTHORIZATION BILL WE BELIEVE REASONABLE LINE COULD BE TAKEN THAT MODEST PLANS FOR DIEGO GARCIA REFLECTED IN 33.3 MILLION DOLLARS REQUESTED IN <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-75 HAVE BEEN PRUNED BY CONGRESS IN A MANNER TO PROVIDE ONLY MOST AUSTERE SUPPORT TO US SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. THAT THE CONGRESS, AFTER FULL AND EXTENSIVE INQUIRY AND DEBATE, IS ON THE VERGE OF SUSTAINING THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION — EVEN IF ON A REDUCED FUNDING BASIS — SEEMS TO US AN EFFECTIVE ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE RATHER MODEST PROGRAM INTENDED AT DIEGO</p>
                        <p>GARCIA.</p>
                        <p>(D) WE ARE STILL FACED WITH THE OVERALL PROBLEM OF THE RESTRICTIVE AMENDMENTS TO THE STATE AUTHORIZATION BILL (THE CASE AMENDMENT ON EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS AND SEPARATE DIEGO GARCIA AMENDMENT) WHICH ALSO MUST AWAIT FINAL RESOLUTION BY HOUSE-SENATE CONFERENCE. HOWEVER, DEFERRING OR CANCELLING THE DIEGO EXPANSION PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE A CENTRAL CONSIDERATION IN THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE CASE AMENDMENT, THE OBJECTIVE OF WHICH IS AIMED AT THE BROAD RANGE OF US OVERSEAS BASE AND FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS (AZORES, SPAIN, ETC.).</p>

                        <p>(E) WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT VOLUNTARY CAPITULATION ON DIEGO AT THIS JUNCTURE COULD WELL FORECLOSE THE PROSPECTS OF ANY SUBSEQUENT BRITISH AGREEMENT, AT LEAST UNDER A LABOR GOVERNMENT, TO DIEGO EXPANSION PLANS. OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE IS THAT THE WILSON GOVERNMENT WILL REAFFIRM THE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE OF THE HEATH GOVERNMENT TO THE DIEGO UPGRADE BUT ONLY AFTER CONGRESS VOTES THE MONEY. IF WE DEFER OR POSTPONE ACTION, THE BRITISH PROBABLY WOULD INSIST THAT ANY SUBSEQUENT PROPOSALS TO EXPAND THE DIEGO FACILITY BE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION AND <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> AGREEMENT.</p>
                        <p>(F) REGARDING THE COLBY TESTIMONY, WE PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON THAT SUBJECT IN REF D, AND WE HAVE HAD NO REASON SINCE THEN TO AMEND OUR VIEWS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE <persName corresp="#p_SJC2">STENNIS</persName> COMMITTEE APPROVAL CAME AFTER THE TESTIMONY.</p>
                        <p>(G) AS YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE MATTER OF ARMS LIMITATION IN THE INDIAN OCEAN HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE EXECUTIVE BRANCH REVIEW; PENDING THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE, THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN REF E REMAINS VALID AND IS REPEATED FOR YOUR USE:</p>

                        <p>HOWEVER, OUR INTENTIONS TO EXPAND OUR FACILITIES ON DIEGO GARCIA ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO ANY GIVEN LEVELS OF SHIP DEPLOYMENTS IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.</p>

                        <p>1. SUMMARY: ON BASIS REVIEW OF EXPERIENCE OVER PAST TWO AND HALF YEARS, EMBASSY CONCLUDES THAT USE OF COLOMBO FOR USN PORT CALLS HAS BEEN ADVANTAGEOUS FOR PROJECTION OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> PRESENCE AND LIMITED FLEET SUPPORT. JULY VISIT OF AMB AND USS LA SALLE TO MALE INDICATES THAT INFREQUENT USN PROT CALLS AT MALDIVES WOULD ALSO BRING POLITICAL AND OPERATIONAL BENEFITS. ISSUE OF USNAVAL PRESENCE IN INDIAN OCEAN CONTINUES TO BE DELICATE AND MUST BE KEPT UNDER CLOSE REVIEW. ON ASSUMPTION</p>

                        <p>PRESENT ASSESSMENTS REMAIN VALID, HOWEVER, EMBASSY RECOMMENDS UP TO SIX TO EIGHT CAREFULLY SPACED VISITS TO COLOMBO A YEAR, OF FIVE RATHER THAN THREE DAYS DURATION; AND ONE VISIT OF THREE DAYS DURATION TO MALE A YEAR. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. EMBASSY HAS JUST COMPLETED REEVALUATION OF SHIP VISIT POLICY AND PROCEDURES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EXPEREINCE OF PAST TWO AND HALF YEARS IN SRI LANKA AND RESULTS OF AMB-USN VISIT TO MALDIVES IN JULY. OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                        <p>3. SRI LANKA. SINCE 1972, COLOMBO HAS BEEN ROUTINELY AVAILABLE FOR PORT VISITS BY US NAVY SHIPS AND OTHER FOREIGN WARSHIPS. TOAL OF 77 SHIPS OF FOREIGN NAVIES CALLED AT COLOMBO IN THIS PERIOD; AMERICAN AND SOVIET NAVIES WERE PREDOMINANT USERS WITH 21 US AND 26 SOVIET PORT CALLS. ALL 21 US SHIPS BUT ONLY 9 OF 26 SOVIET SHIPS WERE COMBATANTS. SOVIET NAVY OPERATES DIFFERENTLY FROM USN, HOWEVER, WHICH MAKES COMPARISON DIFFICULT. IN ANY EVENT, ALL 26 SOVIET SHIPS WERE HANDLED BY <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> PORT AND NAVAL OFFICIALS AS NAVY SHIPS; THAT IS, DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCES, FREE PILOT AND PORT USE, AND SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE PROVIDED BY SRI LANKA NAVY IN SAME MANNER AS WITH ALL VISITING NAVIES. ALTHOUGH <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> HAS PUBLICLY DENIED TRINCOMALEE TO ALL FOREIGN WARSHIPS, COLOMBO IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR PORT VISITS BY FOREIGN NAVIES, AT LEAST IN SHORT RUN. GSL SEES FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS FROM FUEL AND PROVISION SALES AND TOURIST ACTIVITIES OF VISITING SHIPS AS MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF THIS POLICY. FURTHER, GSL CLAIMS THAT LETTING EVERYONE IN REINFORCES ITS NON-ALIGNMENT.</p>
                        <p>4. AVAILABILITY OF PORT OF COLOMBO CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED, HOWEVER.<gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss>'S NON-NUCLEAR DECLARATION POLICY IS STILL ON BOOKS, ALTHOUGH UNENFORCED AT PRESENT, AND MRS BANDARANAIKE'S INDIAN OCEAN PEACE ZONE (<gloss target="#t_IOPZ1">IOPZ</gloss>) PROPOSAL CALLS FOR WITHDRAWAL FROM INDIAN OCEAN OF NAVIES FROM OUTSIDE THE AREA. TO ENCOURAGE</p>

                        <p>PAGE 03 COLOMBO 03099 01 OF 02 080254Z</p>
                        <p>EXISTING <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> OPEN-PORT POLICY, USN SHIPS CALLING AT COLOMBO SHOULD NOT SEEK TO VISIT SO FREQUENTLY OR BE OF SIZE TO CAUSE <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> TO PERCEIVE UNBALANCED OR EXCESSIVE SUPPORT ON ITS PART TO US NAVY OPERATIONS IN INDIAN OCEAN AS COMPARED TO SUPPORT RENDERED SOVIET NAVY. OTHERWISE, <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> MIGHT CHOOSE TO DENY DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCE TO US SHIPS IN SELECTED INSTANCES, OR IT MIGHT POSSIBLY DECIDE RESURRECT NON-NUCLEAR DECLARATION QUESTION, THUS EFFECTIVELY BARRING USN PORT CALLS, OR, TO AVOID APPEARANCE OF ANTI- US POLICY, EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO CLOSE COLOMBO TO WARSHIPS OF ALL NON-LITTORAL NATIONS IN FURTHER PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OF SUPPORT FOR <gloss target="#t_IOPZ1">IOPZ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> CONCERN OVER BALANCED RELATIONS WITH SUPER-POWERS PRESENT IN INDIAN OCEAN WORKS TO OUR ADVANTAGE FOR MODERATE USN USE OF COLOMBO. IF THAT USE IS KEPT MODERATE, IT ALSO SERVED TO LIMIT MAGNITUDE OF SOVIET NAVAL PRESENCE HERE. WHETHER USN OR SOVIET NAVY SHIPS COME TO COLOMBO IS GENERALLY DICTATED BY FLEET OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. NEVERTHE-LESS, TWO NAVIES APPEAR TO BE KEEPING A BALANCE WITH EACH OTHER: A MONTH AFTER ADMIRAL MC CAIN'S VISIT BY AIR IN APRIL 1972, SOVIET ADMIRAL SMIRNOV ARRIVED BY AIR TO CONDUCT SIMILAR HIGH-LEVEL MILITARY VISIT; 13 USN SHIPS CALLED AT COLOMBO IN 1972 AND 5 IN 1973, AND THE SOVIETS SHOWED UP WITH 16 AND 7 RESPECTIVELY; BETWEEN DECEMBER 1973 AND OCTOBER 1974 WHEN US AND SOVIET ACTIVITIES IN INDIAN OCEAN WERE UNDER FIRE IN WORLD PRESS, ONLY 2 SOVIET RESEARCH SHIPS AND NO USN SHIPS CALLED HERE. THUS, WHATEVER WE PLAN AS USN PORT CALL PROGRAM FOR COLOMBO MUST BE SEEN AS CONTRIBUTING TO LEVEL OF SIMILAR AVAILABILITY FOR SOVIET NAVY.</p>
                        <p>6. MALDIVES. US NAVY SHIPS HAVE CALLED AT MALE IN CONNECTION WITH VISITS BY AMERICAN AMBASSADOR IN DEC 1972 AND JULY 174. THIS SMALL NATION HAS BECOME OBJECT OF INTEREST TO OTHER COUNTRIES RECENTLY AS SRI LANKA-MALDIVES RELATIONS UNDERWENT PERIOD OF STRAIN AND GOM LOOKED ELSEWHERE FOR ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC</p>

                        <p>DEPENDENCE ON SRI LANKA. INDIANS AND SOVIETS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN ACTIVE AND, AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN MARITIME SETTING, VISITS OF NAVAL SHIPS HAVE SERVED TO PROJECT THIS INTEREST: AND INDIAN DESTROYER TOOK INDIAN AMB TO MALE IN FEB 1973, SOVIET AMB VISITED ON BOARD RESEARCH SHIP IN 1973, AND OFFICIAL SOVIET EMBASSY PARTY WENT TO MALDIVES IN 1974 ON BOARD SOVIET OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH SHIP. IN 1973, BRITISH HYDROGRAPHIC SHIP HYDRO CONTINUED SURVEY OF MALE ATOLL AND AT LEAST 3 SEPARATE SOVIET RESEARCH SHIPS HAVE CONDUCTED SURVEYS IN MALDIVES.

THUS, DIFFICULTY OF FINDING PLACES IN INDIAN OCEAN WHERE OUR SAILORS CAN ENJOY SHORE LEAVE CAN PERHAPS BE SOMEWHAT ALLEVIATED BY ADDING MALE ATOLL TO VISIT LIST.

                        <p>8. OUR REVIEW HAS LED US CONCLUDE THAT US NAVAL VISITS TO SRI LANKA AND MALDIVES ARE USEFUL IN PROJECTING US PRESENCE, IN DOMONSTRATING CONTINUING ALTHOUGH MODERATE US INTEREST IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES, AND IN PROVIDING REFUELING AND/OR RECREATIONAL FACILTIES FOR SHIPS AND CREWS.</p>

ENTIRE QUESTIONOF US NAVAL PRESENCE IN INDIAN OCEAN REMAINS POLITICALLY SENSITIVE IN SRI LANKA (AND TO LESSER EXTENT IN MALDIVES), AND <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> CONTINUES CONCERNED AT PROSPECTIVE EXPANSION OF DIEGO GARCIA FACILITIES. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, SITUATION WITH REGARD SHIP VISITS COULD CHANGE RAPIDLY AND WE SHALL HAVE TO KEEP MATTER UNDER CONSTANT, CAREFUL REVIEW ON ASSUMPTION FOREGOING EXPERIENCE AND ASSESSMENTS HOLD GOOD, HOWEVER, AND ON ASSUMPTION <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WISHES CONTINUE CURRENT POLICY ON INDIAN OCEAN NAVAL PRESENCE (MIDDLE EAST FORCE AUGMENTED BY PACIFIC FLEET NAVAL UNITS FROM TIME TO TIME), EMBASSY RECOMMENDS USN PORT VISITS TO COLOMBO AND MALE SHOULD FOR PRESENT BE CONSIDERED WITHIN FOLLOWING GUIDELINES:</p>
                        <p>A. COLOMBO:</p>
                        <p>1) UP TO SIX TO EIGHT VISITS A YEAR AT INTERVALS NOT LESS THAN SIX AND PREFERABLY EIGHT WEEKS APART BY PACFLT AND MIDEASTFOR SHIPS.</p>

                        <p>3) NUMBER OF SAILORS ASHORE NOT TO EXCEED 500, WHICH IS LARGEST NUMBER THAT CAN BE PROPERLY ACCOMMODATED BY LIMITED LOCAL FACILITES.</p>
                        <p>4) DURATION OF ROUTINE VISITS TO BE FIVE DAYS IN PORT TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME FOR BOTH PROTOCOL AND PARTICIPATION IN OUR-OF-COLOMBO OVERNIGHT TOURS. UP-COUNTRY TRAVEL INCREASES VISIBILITY OF AMERICAN PRESENCE PROVIDED BY US NAVY VISIT AND ALSO GIVES OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR SAILORS TO VISIT MORE INTERESTING PARTS OF SRI LANKA.</p>
                        <p>5) VISIT PREPARATIONS TO BE STARTED IN TIME TO GIVE EMBASSY 30 DAYS BETWEEN SUBMISSION OF REQUEST FOR DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCE TO <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> AND SHIP ARRIVAL. ONLY WITH SUCH LEAD TIME CAN APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS BE MADE FOR BOTH POLITICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND GOOD RECREATION.</p>
                        <p>B. MALE:</p>
                        <p>1) ONE VISIT PER YEAR IN SEPT OR MARCH/APRIL (FOR BEST WEATHER AND TO AVOID TOURIST SEASON) OF THREE DAYS DURATION.</p>
                        <p>2) INITIAL VISIT UNRELATED TO AMB TRIP TO BE BY MODERATE-SIZED SURFACE SHIP (E.G., DE OR DD) WITH POSSIBILITY OF VISIT BY LARGER SHIPS IF FIRST VISIT IS SUCCESSFUL.</p>
                        <p>3) CREW ACTIVITY PRIMARILY SHIP-RUN BEACH PARTIES WITH SMALL PARTIES TO MALE ISLAND FOR SPORTS AND LIMITED PROTOCOL.</p>
                        <p>4) MAXIMUM USE OF LOCAL BOATS AND OTHER FACILITES TO PROVIDE TANGIBLE INFLUX OF US DOLLARS.</p>
                        <p>5) 45 DAYS NOTICE FOR DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCE REQUEST.</p>

The report also laid out several scenarios based on the availability of PL-480 funding and grain supplies, recommending that the United States provide as much grain to Sri Lanka as possible in fiscal 1975.</note>

                        <p>Following Ceylonese Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>'s recent query about PL 480 assistance (Tab A), you asked for a report on the State position.</p>
                        <p rend="center">
                            <hi rend="italic">Sri Lanka's Food Situation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sri Lanka is in trouble on the food front. Its trade-oriented economy has been unable to adjust to radically increased food and petroleum import costs in the face of relatively stagnant prices for its plantation crop exports. <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> reforms to cut food and fertilizer subsidies and to increase domestic food production so far have prevented national bankruptcy but the cost has been a serious deterioration in nutritional standards. Embassy Colombo estimates that 25 percent of the population now has a diet below FAO minimum nutritional standards compared with a nominal 5 percent in 1970. For 1975, the country needs approximately 1.8 million tons of foodgrain to feed its population even at the present sub-standard nutritional level. On the uncertain assumption that the Ceylonese 1975 rice crop will be good there still is an uncovered deficit of 200,000 tons of foodgrains despite the Government's food production campaign, curtailment of food consumption, heavy commercial purchases of imported wheat (160,000 tons) and 40,000 tons of food aid from other countries. Sri Lanka does not have the foreign exchange to safely finance this deficit. Soaring import costs <pb n="2" xml:id="d82-02" facs="d82-02"/>have produced a trade deficit which will reach an estimated $300 million in 1975 compared to a manageable $10 million in 1973. Optimistic <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> aid receipt calculations and planned borrowings will still leave an uncovered foreign exchange gap of an estimated $150 million in 1975. A $200 million increase in Sri Lanka's 1975 foodgrain import bill over 1972 more than accounts for this deficit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">U.S. Interests</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Last May we pledged $8 million of Title I wheat flour along with an $8 million Development Loan at the Sri Lanka Aid Group meeting. The Ceylonese are anxiously waiting to see what action we will take on the foodgrain question and are increasingly nervous on this score (See Tab B). The economic and humanitarian grounds for food assistance are clear. U.S. food aid will ease the crisis in Sri Lanka and provide the <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> a chance to implement its self-help policies in the field of agriculture.</p>
                        <p>Because of the obvious Ceylonese need, State/AID last September recommended 133,000 tons of wheat for Sri Lanka (more than double what we pledged at the May consortium). Over <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>'s objection Sri Lanka was not included, however, in the 2nd quarter <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75 allocations.</p>
                        <p>There is also a clear political case for helping Sri Lanka. With a relatively small amount of food aid we earn a large amount of good will in Colombo, where we have enjoyed excellent relations in recent years. American failure to provide aid, will damage our relations, particularly in light of our previous pledge and our recent allocations to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and especially the UAR. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> already has indicated uncertainty over her relations with the new Ford Administration. Moreover, her pragmatic foreign policy which has included a friendly attitude toward us, is vulnerable to leftist attack if she cannot demonstrate benefits in the form of U.S. food aid at a time of crisis. She currently <pb n="3" xml:id="d82-03" facs="d82-03"/>faces a political confrontation with her Trotskyite coalition partner, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. The LSSP leadership is being pushed to militancy by its affiliated trade unionists who are adversely affected by food shortages in the urban areas. Ceylon's foreign policy orientation assumes increasing importance as the 1976 Non-Aligned Conference, to be held in Colombo, draws nearer.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">What Should We Do About PL 480 to Sri Lanka</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President has decided there will be an increase in PL 480 this year over last but a final budget decision has not been made. The State/AID high option calls for approximately 3.0 million tons of wheat under Title I. Through December we have approval and budget for 1.3 million tons — for Cambodia, Bangladesh, Chile, Egypt, India, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan and Syria. The minimum additional requirements for these countries during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-75 are 900,000 tons, assuming the India program does not exceed 500,000 tons. No wheat has yet been approved for Sri Lanka and nine other countries although <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> and EB agree that Sri Lanka needs justify substantial PL 480 assistance.</p>
                        <p>There is interagency agreement to attempt to reach a final budget decision on PL 480 in December. If the President approves State/AID's high option ($1,351 million commodity cost) it should be possible at least to provide Sri Lanka with 65,000 tons of wheat, (approximately the quantity we expected to supply under our $ 8 million pledge in May) while seeking the full 133,000 tons if possible.</p>
                        <p>A decision in favor of the middle option ($1,092 million commodity cost) would require us to reduce Title I wheat by at least 1.0 million tons. We would have to drop some planned programs entirely and reduce most others.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d82-04" facs="d82-04"/>
                        <p>There is a danger that Sri Lanka may be lost in the shuffle of competing claims on available PL 480 supplies. Because of economic/humanitarian need and our political interests, we propose to press for at least 65,000 tons of PL 480 wheat during December inter-agency decision-making.</p>

                        <p>1. FROM DISCUSSIONS AT THE FCO WE CAN CONFIRM THAT BRITISH ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED GAN ISLAND NOT BECOME AVAILABLE TO ANOTHER POWER WITH INTERESTS POSSIBLY INIMICAL TO THE WEST WHEN BRITISH GIVE UP THEIR AIR FACILITY THERE. BRITISH PLAN IS TO TRY TO RETAIN THEIR LIEN UNTIL 1986 AS AGREEMENT WITH MALDIVES PROVIDES. IF MALDIVIANS PRESS FOR RETURN OF ISLAND, HOWEVER (PER PARA 3 <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>), BRITISH HOPE TO NEGOTIATE SOME SORT OF UNDERSTANDING THAT AIRSTRIP WILL NOT BE LEASED OUT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. THEY ARE REASONABLY SURE THEY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.</p>

                        <p>2. ALL BRITISH TOLD MALDIVIAN PRIMIN ZAKI DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO UK WAS THAT THEY PLAN TO REMOVE THEIR PRESENCE FROM GAN BY MARCH 1976. THEY ALSO INTIMATED SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE FORTHCOMING TO MAKE UP FOR LOST REVENUE TO MALDIVIAN ECONOMY AS A RESULT OF BRITISH DEPARTURE.</p>
                        <p>3. MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IS AT PRESENT STAFFING OUT EXACT DEPARTURE TIMETABLE. MINISTRY OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT IS STAFFING OUT AN OFFER OF ASSISTANCE. WE HAD BEEN TOLD THIS WOULD AMOUNT TO 3-4 MILLION POUNDS SPACED OVER PERIOD OF 5-6 YEARS, THOUGH LATEST WORD IS SUM MORE LIKE 2-3 MILLION. AIM WOULD BE TO GIVE IT IN FORM OF ADDITIONAL PLEDGES FOR PROJECT ASSISTANCE THROUGH ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, HOPING THIS MIGHT STIMULATE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE AT TIMES EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND US. BRITISH EXPECT TO SEND A STUDY GROUP TO MALDIVES TO LOOK INTO POTENTIAL PROJECTS FOR SUCH ASSISTANCE BY END OF MARCH. NONE OF THIS THINKING HAS YET BEEN COMMUNICATED TO MALDIVIANS, ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, OR INDEED TO <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> MINISTERS FOR APPROVAL. ADDRESSEES PLEASE PROTECT.</p>
                        <p>4. FYI. BRITISH GAINED A VERY GOOD IMPRESSION OF ZAKI AND OTHER OFFICIAL MALDIVIANS DURING THEIR VISIT HERE. THEY CONSIDER ZAKI A CANNY FELLOW WHO KEEPS HIS CARDS CLOSE TO HIS VEST, BUT ALSO A PRACTICAL MAN WHO SHOULD NOT GIVE TROUBLE.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: If I had been in Ankara another 24 hours on my last visit, I could have been the new Prime Minister. No one wanted to take a position on Cyprus. I held discussions with the heads of all five parties trying to discover a Turkish position the US might support. Two of the five, Ecevit and Feyzioglu are former students of mine. That doesn't mean they listen to what I say. Is Feyzioglu's position (as Deputy Prime Minister) a job or just a title?</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: It could be a job.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Ecevit would settle if he were Prime Minister. Whether he'll want a settlement now is another question. He wanted me to delay my efforts. Your domestic situation certainly complicates the matter.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: How about the domestic situation here?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: No, the United States is one of the few countries in the world where domestic politics play no role in foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>SYKES: That's what we've been reporting to London.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: What is the attitude of Congress toward treaty obligations? Although they are questioning some of your executive agreements, they seem to support strict adherence to the letter of formal treaties.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: You mean like your treaty obligations on Cyprus?</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: Yes. My impression was that the United States at first supported our intervention against those who overthrew Makarios. Later on, there was a shift in opinion against us. What will Congress accept on Cyprus?</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d84-03" facs="d84-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: It's a very complicated situation. There were a number of factors involved at the time of your intervention. First, it was during the transition between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>. It was not a period of executive strength. Secondly, the Greeks here organized themselves as a domestic political pressure group very quickly. Our original assessment at the White House was that a settlement could be reached before a Congressional reaction developed. And, finally, there was the Turkish Government crisis. Then, during the pressures of a Congressional election year, a small group of Congressmen were able to sway their colleagues. Most Congressmen know nothing about Cyprus and could care less about details. I believe if the initial vote on the arms embargo were taken now there would be no problem for us. But Congressmen who are on public record as voting for the arms embargo need some tangible evidence of movement toward a settlement to justify revising their vote.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: But the Administration is following the same line on Cyprus?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Everyone knows our position. We are working to reverse the Congressional decision on military assistance and we need definite signs of movement toward a settlement. The Government of Turkey must determine its position. It must realize it cannot take full advantage of Turkey's intervention. There must be some gesture we can use with Congress. If a second vote were taken now, I am sure the arms embargo would be rescinded.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: But now you are expecting a favorable vote in the Senate?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: (Referring to comments made about him by President Makarios during an interview) Why the hell do I have an Assistant Secretary for European Affairs if he can't keep his clients in line.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: I've seen the article. It's not really so bad.</p>
                        <p>HARTMAN: It appears that Makarios is looking for someone he can hang an unpopular settlement on.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d84-04" facs="d84-04"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: That's why you're going out there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Mr. Secretary General, on one of my trips to Damascus, the Syrians asked me why I always take JOE SISCO with me when I'm traveling. I told them that whenever I leave him behind he takes advantage of my absence to measure my office for size.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: And the Syrians believed him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I think the only way to deal with the Arabs is to develop what we would consider an irrational position. An Arab once told me he thought I had lied to him in a letter. I asked him how he had come to that conclusion. He replied that he had read copies of letters I had sent to other Arab leaders at the same time. The letters all said the same thing; therefore, he knew I was lying.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: My experience with the Syrians as Foreign Minister was the same.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Did you ever stay at the official guest house in Damascus? It's right next to a minaret. It goes off every morning at 4:30 a.m. for half an hour. I need my sleep. Now I arrange things so I do not stay in Damascus overnight.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: What do you think of Asad?</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: It's difficult to convince him that you wish to be friendly. But once you do so he is good to deal with — an honorable man.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: My impression is the same.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: We have difficulties with our Arab neighbor from time to time. But we find that they appreciate public gestures of support, even small gestures which do not involve real action. When Iraq nationalized its oil, a reporter in London asked me for my reaction. I replied that we had done the same in Turkey in compliance with international law on full compensation and that I anticipated Iraq would do the same. Two years later, I visited Baghdad. They recalled my remarks and said it proved <pb n="5" xml:id="d84-05" facs="d84-05"/>I was a friend of Iraq. It was a small thing, cost Turkey nothing, but it had great effect on our relations with Iraq.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Mr. Secretary General, do we have any <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> problems?</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: I have just completed my initial discussions with the three regional governments. All three are firmly attached to the principles of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. You have a problem with the Turks on arms supply. It does not affect <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> now, but it could in the future.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: If we can get the Cyprus talks restarted within an agreed framework for a settlement, this will be enough to allow Congress to move on arms.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: That would be very beneficial. The leaders of Turkey have kept cool, but they are subject to public pressure…</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Turkey has shown great restraint.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: Except for some leftist elements, the regional leaders are all reasonable about <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. In Iran, the SHAH has analyzed the situation and will continue his firm attachment to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I wonder if he knows where his ambassador is. He's rarely in Washington, We enjoy his presence when he is here, of course. What is he doing in Mexico?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SS13">SOBER</persName>: He is preparing for the SHAH's visit there.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: The SHAH is worried about the situation in Baluchistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I had the impression that was under control.</p>
                        <p>YAQUB KHAN: The situation has slipped recently.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: The SHAH thinks in long-range terms. He is concerned about Soviet intentions. In the economic field, in spite of many meetings and much paperwork, in terms of substance <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> is inactive.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d84-06" facs="d84-06"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I know what you mean about discussion and paperwork. Happily, I don't see much here. That's because my staff keeps everything from me. About the only things I get for decision are those in which they anticipate failure. Then I get the blame.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: I recognize <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> must work within a restricted framework. It must be a peacekeeping organization, not aggressive. It must not impose on detente. And it must not alarm other regional powers. But still we must be active. We must do more for Pakistan. The Moslem members, for instance, could do something to persuade Afghanistan to be more friendly toward Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I am reluctant to negotiate anything with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. I always lose my shirt.</p>
                        <p>YAQUB KHAN: Yes, he enjoys negotiating with you. But we regard <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> as important to our security.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: After my discussion with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and Minister of State <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>, I am convinced that Pakistan is in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> to stay.</p>
                        <p>YAQUB KHAN: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: But they think something more should be done within <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: What do you have in mind?</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: I have nothing specific to recommend, but as you know, the regional members have for some years been concerned with Soviet-inspired threats from their neighbors — that is, threat by proxy. Iran may perhaps be less concerned since its agreement with Iraq. But Pakistan is most concerned with the imbalance which exists in regard to Indian military power — both in numbers and in war industry. Pakistani intelligence agencies have proof of Soviet involvement in Baluchistan. At the next Ministerial meeting, an effort must be made to deal with matters like subversion by proxy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: We would be pleased to explore specific proposals.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d84-07" facs="d84-07"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Mr. Secretary, maybe it would perhaps be helpful to refresh your memory on this subject. It has a long history within <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I hope you gentlemen will all take note of the delicacy with which the Under Secretary has entered the conversation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The crux of the matter is that the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> treaty is directed at threats from communist-dominated countries. It does not get into threats by proxy from non-communist countries.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: Everyone recognizes that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> was created to deter communist threats. But in the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> region there has always been something like jealousy in comparing NATO and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. Unlike NATO, <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> has no teeth, no unified command, no earmarked forces. The dismemberment of Pakistan created real questions in Pakistan regarding the value of the pact. The atmosphere has improved since the arms embargo was lifted. Compared to India, Pakistan now has great ethnic cohesion. But the numerical imbalance remains. If we cannot sort out some new initiatives in the next Ministerial meeting…</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Of course, the greatest thing we did to show our concern for Pakistan was to lift our arms embargo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Yes, and we are still catching hell from the Hill about that decision.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: But while lifting the arms embargo from one CENTO ally, you applied an embargo on another.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: It is a basic tenet of United States foreign policy that one ally must always be embargoed.</p>
                        <p>BAYULKEN: And we must have some modest economic projects for the Ministerial. I recognize your financial problems. But I wonder if you could make some modest increase in project funds and also in technical assistance. I believe Iran is prepared to make a significant increase in its contribution, but it does not wish to act alone. We are great at discussing things in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, but slow on actions.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d84-08" facs="d84-08"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I support that. Can't we do something with Defense and AID funds?</p>
                        <p>ELLSWORTH: We will look into it.</p>
                        <p>PARKER: We have been discussing the Secretary General's ideas at the technical level.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: We will follow up on this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Dan (Administrator PARKER), see if there is a way to work something out in time for the Ministerial meeting that I can announce there. Mr. Secretary General, I'm looking forward to heading the United States delegation to the Ministerial and seeing you again in Ankara next month. I also want to spend some time in Istanbul after the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The lunch concluded with an exchange of toasts and general conversation.</p>

                            <item>SUMMARY: On April 21 I had candid, highly satisfactory meeting with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> of Sri Lanka. We covered broad range of international and domestic economic and political issues. There were no substantive surprises. She several times expressed warm appreciation for American assistance. I was most impressed with her interest and grasp of variety of topics. In recognition of Sri Lanka's growing international role as September 1976 Non-aligned Conference approaches, I believed United States would do well to continue to demonstrate strong interest in her style of moderate leadership and to maintain significant aid level to Sri Lanka.

                            <item>On April 21, I had unusually forthcoming, wide-ranging, one hour twenty-minute meeting alone with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>. I extended President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>'s personal regards and expressed his Administration's strong desire for continued good relations. I hoped my visit would be seen as reflection of <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> Administration's interest in Sri Lanka at this is of extreme economic adversity. There were no significant outstanding bilateral issues and I was in Sri Lanka and in South Asia primarily to observe and to learn.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>She responded by expressing appreciation for visit and by thanking United States for recent strong support in form of food (100,000 tons wheat flour) and agricultural development ($8 million fertilizer loan) assistance. I said <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> Administration was pleased that in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975 it had provided highest level of American aid to Sri Lanka in any single year. Prime Minister was repeatedly appreciative of U.S. aid during conversation. She said Sri Lanka was not beggar nation and wanted to make its own way. Substantial assistance, however, was essential through present very difficult economic period. She made no specific request for additional assistance.</item>

                            <item>After recalling her warm relations with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, she said she had read great deal about President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and would very much like to meet him. <pb n="3" xml:id="d85-03" facs="d85-03"/>I said I hoped that could be arranged, but extended no explicit invitation.</item>
                            <label>5</label>
                            <item>In terms of Sri Lanka's continually declining terms of trade, she summarized powerful adverse impact of last two years world economic conditions. She expressed hope that ways could be found to stabilize prices for Sri Lanka's primary export products, especially tea.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Referring to our current projection, and to consensus I had observed in discussion with OECD Economic Ministers, I reviewed improving world and American economic outlook but mentioned danger of renewed inflation. Concerning Sri Lanka's outlook, I expressed pleasure over encouraging reports of Sri Lanka's offshore oil potential and mentioned an American firm's interest in recent worldwide call for drilling service contract bids.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>On issue of finding longer term solutions to balance of payments financing problems of Most Seriously Affected (MSA) developing countries, I urged that Sri Lanka consider carefully and sympathetically proposed trust fund in association with the IMF. She was keenly interested.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>We discussed Sri Lanka's leading economic problem: food. I mentioned fiscal burden, price distortions, and production disincentives that arise from heavily subsidized consumption. She acknowledged this was serious difficulty for Sri Lanka but pointed out political risks of tough economic decisions. <pb n="4" xml:id="d85-04" facs="d85-04"/>I said we faced same dilemma.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>On international political issues, Prime Minister said Sri Lanka will continue carefully balanced approach to large nations, specifically mentioning Soviet Union, PRC, India, and Pakistan. She did not raise Indian Ocean Peace Zone or Diego Garcia. I congratulated her on Sri Lanka's hosting of 1976 Non-Aligned Conference. She said she was looking forward to it and <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> was actively preparing for that event. She believes Summit will stimulate significant economic benefits to Sri Lanka.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>She touched briefly on Viet-Nam, expressing sadness over human tragedy and need for much increased humanitarian aid.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>In detailed discussion about national political scene, Prime Minister said 1971 insurrection was extremely serious threat to her Government and to general political stability. She expressed deep appreciation for rapid, substantial American assistance in that crisis. I said that we greatly admired her courage and leadership at that time. She also talked at some length about political philosophy of her late husband as Prime Minister and increasingly prominent political role of her children. She clearly sees her family as important element in nation's political future.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>Referring again to high U.S. aid level this year <pb n="5" xml:id="d85-05" facs="d85-05"/>($35.5 million), I said that although Congress examined assistance proposals more closely each year, United States was committed to assisting nations which help themselves. I said, however, that Sri Lanka-U.S. ties should not be based on aid alone. Our mutual goal should be development of long-term comprehensive relationship through which we can discuss any issue of mutual interest candidly and constructively.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>COMMENT: This was personally very satisfying meeting. Prime Minister was most gracious, most appreciative of American interest and real support for Sri Lanka, and most interested in current American view of difficult global scene. In my judgment, Prime Minister and Sri Lanka over next 18 months will have increasingly important role among non-aligned nations. 1976 Non-Aligned Summit could assume major significance in world political developments and Prime Minister will have key opportunity to promote moderate constructive deliberation — or to acquiesce in meaningless anti-Western polemics. I think recent U.S. aid and this visit form good basis to encourage Prime Minister's stated intention to pursue first alternative. We will do well to continue our aid at significant level and to demonstrate our ongoing interest in Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>'s pragmatic personal leadership and her balanced non-alignment. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">VAN HOLLEN</persName> [CVH initialed]</item>

                        <p>[Omitted here is material unrelated to Diego Garcia]</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: On Diego Garcia, it seems to me we ought to point out what the Russians are doing in the Indian Ocean that makes anything we do in Diego Garcia fairly pathetic.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: We had quite a discussion on this in the ANZUS meeting yesterday. I don't think the Australians or New Zealanders were really aware of it. But we told them about Somalia.</p>
                        <p>MR. SONNENFELDT: Is Schlesslinger going to publish some pictures today?</p>
                        <p>MR. STERN: The story was he was going to give them to Newsweek.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Only to Newsweek?</p>
                        <p>MR STERN: That is what we heard.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: It's an odd procedure.</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: The photographs by themselves are not very impressive, unless you know what the analysis is. They are dust a bunch of buildings.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: It mentioned an air field.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d86-03" facs="d86-03"/>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: You can see an airstrip.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName>: Cruise missiles.</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: The cruise missile facility — it would take a genius to know it is a cruise missile facility, unless there is an adequate explanation, and a matching picture from the Soviet Union. It is just some buildings and a road.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Well, is it a cruise missile facility?</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: Yes. It looks like the same facility in the Soviet Union. It has a large bay building.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Why would they put a cruise missile facility there?</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: Well, it will give them a lot more time on station for the cruisers.</p>
                        <p>MR. SONNENFELDT: It is a storage facility, to provide ships.</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: But it is also to take down — the smaller cruise missiles they have to take out the fuel and refuel them, because they deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: How often?</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: They have to do it about every ninety days. And preferably around sixty days. And at present, <pb n="4" xml:id="d86-04" facs="d86-04"/>what they have to do is go all the way back to the Soviet Union. With this facility in operation, they can come into Somalia, take the missiles off the ship, refuel them at this base, which is inland a little way, and the ship goes back out to sea and stays on station.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Why would they put a base to refuel cruise missiles inland?</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: I mean it is not right on the dock. It is about three miles away.</p>
                        <p>MR. SONNENFELDT: They have a complete facility there. They have a compound for their people. It is a base in every sense of the word.</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: That is just one part. They also have a communications facility. They have <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Why does Somalia do it?</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: For weapons. I'm not even sure that the Somalians realize how extensive it is.</p>
                        <p>MR. SONNENFELDT: The communication facility is almost unique for an overseas facility by the Russians, isn't it?</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: Yes. Other than possibly Cuba. It is the only place outside of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact, that they have a command headquarters that is in <pb n="5" xml:id="d86-05" facs="d86-05"/>control of tactical units.</p>
                        <p>To complain about Diego Garcia in the light of what the Russians are doing in the Indian Ocean is a little silly.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: How would you answer the argument that would be made why shouldn't both abandon their bases?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName>: That is the argument New Zealand proposed yesterday — we should negotiate with the Russians to get down the presence.</p>
                        <p>MR. SONNENFELDT: The result would be that the Russians continue to stay in Somalia and we don't get into Diego Garcia.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: We have not made a good case for Diego Garcia.</p>
                        <p>MR. LORD: If you try the Russians and they turn you down, you have a stronger case on the Hill, it seems to me.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">HABIB</persName>: Several years ago you tried the Russians, and they didn't respond.</p>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: The Russians hardly ever mention it.</p>
                        <p>MR. LORD: if we can't get Diego Garcia, isn't it better to get rid of the Russian base?</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d86-06" facs="d86-06"/>
                        <p>MR. HYLAND: I don't think it is such a good idea to keep going around trying to find bases to negotiate the neutralization of Soviet or American presence. If we get Diego Garcia, maybe we can negotiate. If we don't get it, I don't see how you can negotiate.</p>

                            </hi>: Well, I think that, basically, we have two things to talk about today—Diego Garcia, and its relationship to arms control. I know that the Working Group has come up with three options as to what our force presence should be in the Indian Ocean. The first option foresees a pre-October 1973 force level, which is lower than our current deployment level. The second option is of a somewhat higher level, and the- third option calls for a high level, or a significant increase in force presence. I can guess what everybody here favors. I want to congratulate the Working Group for the careful way in which they put the choices before us! Is anybody in favor of the pre-October 1973 level?</p>

                            </hi>: Well, I don't think that we need a big discussion on force levels. The real issue is deployment. Let me get it clear on what you mean by arms control approaches for limiting deployments. One would be limits on naval deployments, and the second would be limits on bases. Is that correct? But couldn't limits on naval deployments be negotiated independent of limits on bases?</p>

                            </hi>: I don't think so, <persName>Henry</persName>. Diego Garcia is a support facility, not a base. In the context of our terminology, Diego Garcia is not a base.</p>

Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWPBJ1">Clements</persName>: Well, it becomes a base when we make certain improvements. As you know, we propose only to add about 300 more people to that facility. That would only make a total complement of some 600 people.</p>

                            </hi>: What would 300 more people do that the 280 people can't do now?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWPBJ1">Clements</persName>
                            </hi>: Well, they would refuel airplanes, service a deep-water jetty that we plan to build there, and do other general housekeeping duties.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I assume that you would want to go from a support facility to a base. I could get more enthusiastic about a base than just upping the number of people from 280 to 600.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BBWJ1">Brown</persName>
                            </hi>: We've been in there at Diego Garcia for some time now. We want to improve the facilities, you know, like provide some ramps and some parking facilities for aircraft.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: What would you do if you made it a base?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BBWJ1">Brown</persName>
                            </hi>: What we're talking about is making Diego Garcia a support base, not an operational base. An operational base means that you would have a deployed unit stationed there at all times. We're not talking about that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWPBJ1">Clements</persName>

                            </hi>: Besides, Diego Garcia could become more important if we lose those facilities in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Well, I'm not opposed to the concept of a base at Diego Garcia, I'm just tryng to understand what is needed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWPBJ1">Clements</persName>
                            </hi>: All it would mean is that there would be more people stationed there. There would be no planes stationed there. We want to build a jetty and some other things, but there would be no ships stationed there.</p>

In the second option, we would propose a freeze—negotiation on a bilateral basis, with the Soviets.

                            </hi>: Then what you are saying is that a freeze on the number of ship-days, at any level, would not affect Diego Garcia. That (Diego Garcia) could be negotiated separately. We would have to assume that each side (the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the U.S.) would declare more bases than it actually has so that it can maintain the ones it really wants. What do we have, at least two bases, Bahrain and Diego Garcia?</p>

                            </hi>: Well, I guess we could say—a way to prevent that is to allow each only one base and declare the rest illegal.</p>

                        <p>DATE &amp; TIME: Friday - May 23, 1975 9:45 a. m. - 12:00 noon</p>
                        <p>PLACE: <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Headquarters Ankara, Turkey</p>
                        <p>Caglayangil (Chairman): The topic of this meeting is a review of the international situation. I would like to hear your views, Mr. KHALATBARY.</p>
                        <p>KHALATBARY: The main subject of my remarks is what is happening to Iran. Last year in February we had severe border clashes with Iraq, after which Iraq went to the Security Council. The Security Council appointed Mr. Weekmann of Mexico. His report had the usual result: The Security Council asked both parties to discuss bilaterally and find a solution. Iraq and Iran had a meeting in Istanbul, and in October I met the Iraqi <pb n="2" xml:id="d88-02" facs="d88-02"/>Foreign Minister in New York. We couldn't get anywhere. Then the Iraqi Foreign Minister died, and for some time they had no Foreign Minister. Then there was another meeting, with the new Iraqi Foreign Minister, in Istanbul.</p>
                        <p>A surprise came in the OPEC meeting in Algiers in March when the SHAH and the Vice President of Iraq agreed that the land borders would be the borders corresponding to the Protocols of 1913 and 1914 with the Ottoman Empire, but for the border on the Shatt-al-Arab, Iraq agreed to the international border on the thalweg. Then there was a third disposition that Iraq insisted on, the closing of the land border to what they called subversive elements. The Foreign Minister of Iraq came to Iran, with the Algerian Foreign Minister's good offices, and there was another meeting in Algiers. The borders are now delineated; the closure of the border is now done. There are 95,000 refugees now in Iran. Iraq has agreed to keep the borders open for those who want to go back. A great number are going back. We think it's a matter of time, for them to feel there is no danger for them if they go back to Iraq. There will be a treaty to be signed to recognize what has been agreed. When relations become normal again, there will be the possibility to develop our relations in different fields with Iraq.</p>
                        <p>We feel this will be in the interests of peace and security in the region. The main danger, as you know, was Iraq was going more and more to the left, if I may say, with close ties to the Communist Party in Iraq and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had facilities in the Persian Gulf in Iraq, mainly at Umm Qasr. We hope that with these new relations, this influence will diminish, but we are sure they will not give up so easily, and internal difficulties may arise in Iraq. But their main problem now is the difficulties with Syria over the waters of the Euphrates.</p>
                        <p>Of course what the Soviet Union is looking for is not only Iraq and the Persian Gulf but influence on Europe and the West and especially Japan, who are dependent on oil from the Persian Gulf area, not only from Iraq. It would be a very severe blow to the West the Soviet Union could get control or at least control over the transport of oil.</p>
                        <p>I would like to say a word about the Indian Ocean and India and the armaments of India and the close relations of India to the Soviet Union. A treaty exists not only between the Soviet Union and India but between the Soviet Union and Iraq. I could say a word also about the close contacts between Iran and India.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d88-03" facs="d88-03"/>
                        <p>When we think of Spain, Italy, Yugoslavia after Tito, this gives us a picture that is not very rosy of our region and neighboring countries and the potential future dangers we can see.</p>
                        <p>In Southeast Asia, we feel that China could have a greater role than the Soviet Union. At least we hope so, because China is not a naval power while the Soviet Union is. So if the Chinese were a power of greater influence, it would be perhaps a lesser threat than if the Soviet Union had influence in the region.</p>
                        <p>In our neighborhood, we were very much concerned at the death of King Faisal. But we are happy that the evolution has been smooth and we hope the new leadership in Saudi Arabia will be able to continue a line of policy that will not present any danger for the littoral states of the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Caglayangil</hi>: Thank you. I'd like to request your views on this topic, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA8">Aziz Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> is very lucky to have as Secretary General a man of the abilities of Mr. Baluyken, especially when our region is having difficulties as serious as we face now.</p>
                        <p>I'd like to say a few words about the nature of the threat we face and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>'s response.</p>
                        <p>During the last 20 years of its existence, I regret to say that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> members have not been able to agree on the nature of the threat, not to mention the military means to protect against it. Since the 1971 <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> meeting, Pakistan has not only been attacked by arms supplied by the Soviet Union, but dismembered, and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> did not so much as raise an eyebrow. Quite obviously it was a Soviet-inspired and Soviet-armed attack. It is our view that but for the Soviet support, connivance, and active involvement, it would not have happened. If one looks for evidence, one only has to look at the 1971 Treaty. It's quite obviously a military alliance; it says “in the event of an attack or threat of attack — not “aggression:” —the two parties shall immediately enter into consultation to remove such a threat to take effective measures to remove such threat.” I don't know if the Soviet Union could have put its support for India in stronger terms. India was planning an attack on East Pakistan and the Treaty warned China off.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d88-04" facs="d88-04"/>
                        <p>The United States was unable to assist because the debate in the US was over even a minor policy tilt. Because of the influence of the India lobby. I was not in the government but I was appalled by it. We and the United States had not one but four security agreements.</p>
                        <p>In light of our experience, particularly in the 1970's, of the techniques the Communist powers have developed to extend their influence in the non-Communist world — not a direct attack, but indirect, attack by proxy — I would like to suggest: Is it sufficient for this organization, which is concerned to protect the security of this region, to concern itself only with a direct attack? The reason for this paralysis is the view taken over the years that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> is concerned only with a direct attack, and an indirect attack has not even been discussed. In light of our own bitter experience, we think it would be useful to discuss it. Because a direct attack has not come and is not likely to come. We think this is a matter that should receive the attention of this distinguished body.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation in the past, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS13">Sober</persName>, said that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> couldn't possibly be concerned about a dispute between India and Pakistan. But we feel India could just say, “We've been patient with you for twenty years; now just get out,” or Afghanistan could just impose its claims —and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> would do nothing. We have no complaint about our bilateral relations with the United States, and we are very grateful for the assistance we have received, especially by this Administration, but we want to know if <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> is concerned with this kind of attack of Communist proxies. Geography makes it impossible for the Soviet Union to attack Pakistan directly.</p>
                        <p>If the answer is no, we might well ask whether it is wise for us to wave this <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> red flag before the Soviet Union. Because <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> is clearly a red flag for the Soviet Union. If we weren't in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, we would still earn the hostility of the Soviet Union because of our alliance with the US, but in recent years it's been more related to our membership in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. We shall remain in the alliance, but is it right — are we adding to Soviet hostility and danger by being members? We're not going to leave, but we think this is a relevant question to put to you. Because we think the threat to this region will increase, not diminish. And it won't be a direct attack. Turkey is in NATO and Iran will soon be in a position to take care of itself, so that leaves only Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Caglayangil: I'd like to request your views on this subject, Mr. Hattersley.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d88-05" facs="d88-05"/>
                        <p>Hattersley: I'd like to offer a few thoughts on topics on which we are especially concerned in the United Kingdom; on which we want to take OUT <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> colleagues into our confidence, though the relationship to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> may be indirect.</p>
                        <p>I want to say our permanent and secure membership in the EEC is virtually assured, as certain as anything can be in democracies where votes have to be counted, in the referendum in 13 days' time. We don't see the EEC as something we withdraw into either economically or politically; it has become more outward-looking, partly as a result of the influence of my Government. We see our relations with the United States as more in terms of cooperation than competition. When British membership becomes secure and permanent, we will work to develop this. My Prime Minister has tried to pioneer, at the Commonwealth Prime Minister's Conference at Kingston, a new approach to the buying and selling of commodities. On the same day I briefed it to my EEC colleagues. So in our other alliances and relationships we continue with the same enthusiasm and permanency as in the EEC membership.</p>
                        <p>Now I would like to turn to the NATO summit coming up in less than two weeks time. That summit is for a reaffirmation of common purpose, similar to what we do here. Another issue to be discussed at the NATO summit is the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and it's prospects. When they meet, they will reaffirm that detente is not an alternative to defense. These are two parallel elements. We all have difficulty explaining to our public opinions why it's necessary, especially to the young generation which has never experienced the worst days of the Cold War. To put it crudely, some say, since President Ford and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Prime Minister WILSON and Foreign Secretary CALLAGHAN have such success in Moscow and such good relations with the Soviet Union, why do we need defense?</p>
                        <p>My Government expects this round [of CSCE] will be completed and will end with a Summit during this summer. It is our hope and wish and anticipation. But we know that success that is celebrated should be genuine, not bogus. We are prepared for progress on confidence-building measures, Basket III on human and professional rights, but it must be real or else it will only encourage those who think the danger is over. To have a speedy and successful conclusion, it must be genuine.</p>
                        <p>On issues related to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, let me say my Government welcomes without reservation the agreement between Iran and Iraq, which is one of the most <pb n="6" xml:id="d88-06" facs="d88-06"/>important developments in recent years. Much credit is due to Iran. Because of the degree of dependency of Iraq on the Soviet Union, it will take some time to see a marked reduction in Soviet arms, but this is an important start.</p>
                        <p>Another important agreement was between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which put an end to the border dispute with Abu Dhabi. Britain labored long and hard for it. Saudi Arabia is important and has an important contribution to make. Despite our withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, my Government is still providing certain forms of assistance, notably in Oman. We agreed not to subject this to cuts in our defense review. Iranian and Jordanian help has been important in Oman, but there has been no visible slackening of the rebels' will to fight. A military solution may not be possible, especially while the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen continues to give help to the rebels. We're hoping Saudi Arabia can influence the PDRY to be more moderate.</p>
                        <p>I hope we, in all our alliance relationships and commonwealth, can contribute.</p>
                        <p>Caglayangil: I would like your views on this topic, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Foreign Minister, gentlemen. First, let me express my regret for having missed the closed session, at which the Secretary General gave, at all reports, an able account and also I'd like to express our thanks to the Secretary General. Our Ambassador has already expressed our view of complete support for the Secretary General's proposals. The United States is prepared to make a contribution of $500,000 to renovate the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> microwave system in Pakistan, and to renovate the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> military communications system we will ask Congress for $5 million. We do this to indicate our support for this Organization. This is in addition to the six fellowships we will establish to commemorate the 20th anniversary of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and additional budgetary support for the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Secretariat budget.</p>
                        <p>Before I go into our presentation I'd like to comment on the remarks of my colleague from Pakistan. In 1971 we did not think we were doing a minor tilt, certainly in terms of the domestic price paid and the international price. And we believe we prevented an attack on West Pakistan. As I said yesterday, we consider the integrity of Pakistan an interest of the United States. I say this because I believe a country that does not stay with its friends cannot be very effective with its adversaries.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d88-07" facs="d88-07"/>
                        <p>One of the principal focal points of our foreign policy is our West European allies. The President will be going to the Summit next week, to symbolize this continued American commitment to the security of Western Europe. Some recent events in Europe have been significant.</p>
                        <p>We consider events in Portugal more gravely than do some of our Western allies. Some of our allies see a Communist government leaving NATO as the greatest danger. What we see is that a government that is Communist-dominated, neutralist, a Yugoslavian-type government, remaining in NATO could have the same effect on Italy and France. And we don't see that the way to help the moderates is to give aid to the radicals. Although in our actions we are doing the same as our European allies are doing. And in fairness, we have not put forward any concrete alternative policy. But there is no question in our mind this could have a harmful effect on Europe and the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>On the positive side, we have been making efforts to strengthen and rationalize our defense structures; and in none of our countries can we base joint action on security grounds alone. We can't justify action in defense without cohesion in other areas of our endeavor. This is embodied in organizations like the IEA. We welcome the initiative of the British Prime Minister on commodities. Even if there are technical differences on the methods to be used, we share the attitude and the approach, and we will stay in the closest touch with our British colleague.</p>
                        <p>In NATO and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, we face an infinitely more complex situation. Ten years ago, the world was neatly divided between Communist and non-Communist; we could gear ourselves to the military threat alone; the United States was dominant and the other allies could confine themselves to lobbying in our decision-making process. The Communist world is now radically split. In ten years' time we can't exclude a war between the Soviet Union and China. Western Europe and Japan have grown in strength. Western Europe has grown in unity, and we favor it. While we have stayed out of the British referendum, we would welcome the result that seems to be shaping up.</p>
                        <p>In our domestic situation, we have the problem that Mr. Hattersley pointed to, with less consciousness of a military threat. Our generation was perhaps traumatized by Munich, by the fear of appeasement. The present generation, in our country, has been traumatized by Vietnam and by the fear of military involvement, or are not conscious of the threat. So this is the problem of management; we have to show we made every effort to maintain the peace <pb n="8" xml:id="d88-08" facs="d88-08"/>if we are to be strong anywhere. Some now fear excessive American military involvement and want to substitute for it military weakness. We cannot leave to the Communist powers a monopoly over the peace movement. It is easy to run foreign policy for the short term by demagogic anti-Communism. But to maintain a consistent foreign policy without fluctuations we have to show we made the effort, to prove to ourselves and to our public that we made every effort to maintain the peace. For example, if there is a crisis over Berlin, we cannot be open to charges that we missed the opportunity for the Quadripartite Agreement.</p>
                        <p>In detente with the Soviet Union, there are four areas of our relations. The first is preventing thermonuclear war. No serious Western leader can avoid this question. It's easy to plan military operations as if nuclear weapons didn't exist. But we know that in a general nuclear war thirty million people will die. No country has ever faced this. In four years in World War I, two million died and the political structure of Europe was severely shaken. There is no scenario for general nuclear war which involves less than ten million dead. So this is the reason for the agreements we have negotiated or are negotiating with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The second area of our relationship concerns areas where we impinge on each other directly. This is the reason for the European Security Conference and the Berlin agreement.</p>
                        <p>The third is bilateral projects, in which we are engaged for cooperation in many fields.</p>
                        <p>The fourth area is our conflicts in peripheral areas. Here the progress has not been adequate. I don't believe the Soviet Union has à master plan for taking over the world. I don't think they are that far-sighted. I think that in a society so bureaucratized as theirs, they're piling up arms because it's bureaucratically easier to just appease the vested interests.</p>
                        <p>We must never see detente as a substitute for our own efforts. A lot of places where the equilibrium has been upset, what upset the balance was our lack of effort. They kept their effort steady while we diminished ours. In Indochina, whatever one thinks of how it was conceived, the result was brought about by the reduction of American aid. Soviet arms made the North Vietnamese victory possible; our cutoff of aid made it inevitable. Nor do I think Portugal is the result of Soviet connivance. There is no law of nature that says the non-Communist parties must be ill-organized. Nor is there a law of nature that we can't maintain adequate defenses.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d88-09" facs="d88-09"/>
                        <p>If we don't make the effort, we cannot use detente as a substitute for it. We cannot use detente to get Soviet restraint. Restraint follows our effort, and is not a substitute for it. There is no substitute for security. We have to get into the heads of our peoples, particularly the intellectuals, that power is not, inherently evil. Power is neutral — evil is not necessarily the only possibility — but without power there is no policy.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the People's Republic of China, we are following essentially the same policy. Every time I go there, our press asks are we making progress on normalization regarding Taiwan. Our relationship rests on their fear of the Soviet Union and their desire for us to maintain the balance. Since we too want to restrain the Soviet Union, and since the Chinese are very able and very unsentimental, the relationship has worked very well. The Chinese have no interest in us except if we maintain the balance of power.</p>
                        <p>Some in the U5 say that 20 years of estrangement was unendurable for both of us. Maybe it was unendurable for us, but the Chinese existed for 2000 years without contact with us and could exist happily for 2000 more years without contact with us, unless the balance of power requires it.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Southeast Asia, four years ago I was being lectured to by an Indian leader. I said, “Be careful what you recommend, because we might take your advice. And it's the last time we'll fight for your interests.”</p>
                        <p>People in America can debate about the domino effect. Every event has a domino effect simply because every event has a train of consequences, and the only question is where it stops. Already it has had the obvious effect on Cambodia and Laos, and maybe soon will in Malaysia, Burma, and Indonesia. They may not go under, but it will have an effect. It will bring the Communist sphere of influence close to the Indian Subcontinent. It will be interesting to see what the Chinese reaction is. Soviet arms are on many sides. They may try to play a balancing role in Southeast Asia. Maybe they will try to join the Vietnamese in some of their aspirations. But whatever they do, they share the view that there is no security without a degree of physical equilibrium.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Middle East, you know of course of the efforts made by the United States to promote a peaceful evolution in the Middle East. There a have been conceptually two approaches. One is an overall settlement on comprehensive basis; the other is the step-by-step. The overall settlement has an obvious attraction; the difficulty is that by bringing together all the <pb n="10" xml:id="d88-10" facs="d88-10"/>countries it compounds the tendency in some Arab countries to forget where reality ends and epic poetry begins; and it compounds the problem of our domestic situation; and thirdly, it brings the Soviet Union in the most negative way possible by asking them to take a position on all the issues simultaneously. We have preferred to isolate the issues and tackle the soluble ones.</p>
                        <p>We are disappointed by the suspension of our efforts. We are determined not to allow a stalemate; this may not be the impression of everyone, but this is the determination of the United States. There is a lull now, and there will be no decision until the President sees <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">Sadat</persName>, Rabin and other Arab leaders. Because we don't believe it is possible to freeze the situation without an explosion which would jeopardize the security and economic situation.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Persian Gulf, we welcome the agreement between Iran and Iraq. Our interests there are negative, in that we want to prevent the Soviet Union from achieving hegemonial designs there and threatening Western energy sources.</p>
                        <p>I have said that security is the central element of the international system — because the participants must not feel that they are at the mercy of hostile elements. But there is another aspect — that the parties must feel that the system is just. We have been emphasizing the elements of interdependence. We have called attention to the fact that the price of one essential commodity shouldn't be forced to a level that threatens the well-being of the Western economy, however justified it may be historically. We also can consider the quest ion of commodities, for we recognize that we cannot complain of the prices of some commodities that are too high while ignoring their concern at the prices of other commodities that are too low. I have to say that not every Cabinet member in the United States shares this view, but it will prevail.</p>
                        <p>I want to say something about the Group of 77. It is paradoxical that the most cohesive bloc today is the alignment of the so-called non-aligned. Tactics of confrontation will lead to tests of strength and it is not the strongest powers who will suffer. We will give increasing attention to this issues in the next year.</p>
                        <p>These, Mr. Foreign Minister, are the major issues that we see. We have discussed other issues on a bilateral basis. We have discussed the conflict between Greece and Turkey on Cyprus. We believe it is not in <pb n="11" xml:id="d88-11" facs="d88-11"/>the interest of either to push for a confrontation that weakens both. We feel that the moment is possible for a solution.</p>
                        <p>The question we face is whether free countries can understand the elements of progress and the requirements of security in the modern world and work to achieve them. The question is also whether the United States can work for this because our peace and our security depend on this. Caglayangil: Thank you, Mr. Secretary of State, for your illuminating statement. I would like to say a few words.</p>
                        <p>Our organization was created 20 years ago to strengthen cooperation through the United States and United Kingdom and ties with the three regional members, and security and progress. It was founded in the belief that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> could deter aggression in this part of the world.</p>
                        <p>It is most unfair to say <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> has not been successful.</p>
                        <p>We share the approach of seeking something better than Cold War and seeking more stable relationships. Progress so far in detente supports this evaluation. But we must recognize we are not yet at the final destination. This is the most important challenge of detente.</p>
                        <p>Solidarity and cooperation have made this progress possible, so we must maintain this solidarity and cooperation.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>Secondly, the maintenance of adequate defense and preparedness and cooperation between us is of great importance for the maintenance of détente.</item>
                            <item>Thirdly, detente is indivisible. In fact, in our opinion, it can only be maintained if it is broadly based and not limited to a limited area. Care should be taken, while success in arms control and security in Europe are important, so that detente isn't exploited by the Soviet Union for opportunities in other areas.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>We certainly hope the deliberations in CSCE will be successful so that detente in Europe will have a stronger basis. We hope it will have beneficial effects on our region.</p>
                        <p>We also follow with keen interest SALT and MBFR negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d88-12" facs="d88-12"/>
                        <p>While the end of war in Vietnam is important for the relaxation of tensions there, it is too early to evaluate its full implications. It is difficult also to foresee the relationship between the Soviet Union and China in Asia. The Chinese see their role as counterbalancing the Soviet Union. The region is still in flux.</p>
                        <p>In the Middle East, if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s efforts cannot be resumed, we see the Soviet Union's efforts to take up the initiative. In fact, their role is already resumed. If the Suez Canal were to be reopened, the whole Southwest Asian part will become more vulnerable. Soviet penetration continuing since the last Ministerial meeting in Washington has been about the same.</p>
                        <p>In the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> region, the agreement between Iran and Iraq is an important contribution to stability in the region. I would like to convey admiration for the Shah's efforts.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan has made important efforts for normalization of relations on the subcontinent. We hope other countries will respond in the same spirit to this constructive attitude of Pakistan. Pakistan is a country with whom we have many ties. We welcome the recent decision of the United States Government to resume arms sales to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>On Cyprus, the actions taken by Turkey on July 20, 1974, after the action of the Greek junta were aimed at the well-being of the Turkish minority there and territorial integrity and nonalignment of Cyprus. The talks have begun between the two communities to discuss the outstanding questions. The Turkish side showed its good will with forthcoming proposals. However, the Greek side was intransigent and added complications by trying to internationalize the issue and stimulating decisions by the U.S. Congress to cut off arms aid to Turkey. In fact this is the major difference between the approach of the two sides. Turkey always felt it should be decided by the two sides; The Greek sides have sought to bring it to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or internationalization. In February 1975, the Turkish side established an autonomous federal state to improve the situation there; it was purely an internal reorganization. It was aimed at creating two federal zones. However, the Greek side took it to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council to further stimulate international public opinion. However, it is known that the Greek side long contemplated such a move. Recent talks began in Vienna. In our view, the most realistic solution reflecting the situation in the Island would be a bizonal federal state based on the geographic situation. In fact, two zones by now are fully accepted <pb n="13" xml:id="d88-13" facs="d88-13"/>by public opinion. The world can influence Makarios and the Greek Government to recognize the realities of the situation and refrain from further internationalization.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, an objective evaluation of Turkish actions on Cyprus would recognize that they not only prevented a wider conflict and brought about its localization, but prevented a wider endangerment of conditions.</item>
                            <item>Secondly, the Turkish action laid down the conditions for a just resolution of the Cyprus issue, because the problem resulted from the Greek Cypriots' treatment of Turkish Cypriots as unimportant. Now, the existence of two communities is the basis for a just solution.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The action of the U. S. Congress had a negative effect on three counts:
<list>
                                <item>First, it hardened the Greek attitude and was based on the wrong assumption that Turkey would change its position because of such an action.</item>
                                <item>Second, it weakened the southern flank of NATO and put in jeopardy the very objectives of the Alliance.</item>
                                <item>Third, it strained the relations of long-standing friendship and alliance between the United States and Turkey.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>We appreciate the efforts of President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to correct this situation. We find it hard to explain to the Turkish public opinion why the United States, which gives military aid to 90 countries, including Yugoslavia, has cut off aid to an ally which United States leaders call a valuable ally. This has affected confidence in the United States. I feel compelled to state with great concern that if the efforts of the Administration do not prove fruitful in the very proximate future, my Government may not be able to resist public pressures indefinitely before irrevocable damage is done.</p>
                        <p>The United Kingdom's approach, I am afraid, is an unconstructive attitude. The recent action by the Commonwealth Conference creating a committee for implementing of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on Cyprus was an example. The United Kingdom, as an ally in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, should have used its influence against such an action.</p>
                        <p>I say with satisfaction that relations among the regional members are excellent. There should be more cooperation among the regional <pb n="14" xml:id="d88-14" facs="d88-14"/>members to maintain the balance. The non-regional members have always given support to the regional members. Therefore, the embargo by the United States will affect the strength of the Organization and not only in a direct military sense.</p>
                        <p>The Organization in the future I hope will work for the security of its members in the military and other spheres.</p>

I was talking about the extent of public condemnation of U.S. actions trying to help an ally. I was not criticizing the U.S., but it was the public opinion that amazed me.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I would like Jim to say something about the controversy over Berbera. I claimed in a press conference last fall that the Soviet Union had a base there. They denied it; we showed our photos, and the Somalis asked some Congressmen to visit.</p>

                            </hi>: The Soviets have had a tracking station there for some time. Recently our photo reconnaissance showed clear evidence of major construction, including the largest airfield on the Indian Ocean and a missile storage and handling facility. We took some releaseable photos. The upshot was that a group of reporters and eight Congressmen went there. [He described the visits] The upshot has been that American <pb n="2" xml:id="d89-02" facs="d89-02"/>credibility is upheld and those who opposed Diego Garcia on the faith of Soviet statements are in disarray. Diego Garcia should therefore pass. It also indicates the success of verification by National Technical Means. Heretofore, many have argued that we could not rely on it without having on-site inspection.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We do have a reliable technical surveillance capability. The Congressmen have verified the reliability of that technical means through this trip. The important point is our verification capability has been enhanced.</p>

He noted that he had been called upon to comment on BREZHNEV's statement to CPSU Congress regarding Soviet “bases” in Indian Ocean and said he felt he could not publicly challenge BREZHNEV's statement in press conference. He said, however, that he knew that BREZHNEV's statement did not contain “the whole truth.”</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>ACTION</p>
                        <p>March 26, 1976</p>
                        <p>Our earlier memo to you on this subject (Tab A) referred to a requirement for a report to the Congress by April 15 on initiatives the Administration has taken regarding US/Soviet arms restraint in the Indian Ocean. I understand there is some question about the origin of this requirement.</p>
                        <p>Our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76 budget request to Congress included $13. 8 million for the Diego Garcia expansion. These funds were approved by the Congress in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76 Military Construction Appropriation Act, but a freeze was placed on the expenditure of all but a small portion of the funds until April 15, 1976, as a concession to those Congressmen who wanted to allow time for the Administration to pursue possible arms limitation in the Indian Ocean area with the Soviets. The legislation itself does not mention any report to Congress on this subject but the Conference Report (Tab B) states that the conferees have the “full expectation” that the Administration will report to the appropriate committees “regarding negotiation initiatives” before April 15.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of the legal counsel and Congressional relations people at State and Defense that while there is no formal legal requirement for a report on April 15, the language in the conference report has the same effect, and we ignore it at our peril. Senator CULVER has indicated in discussions with <persName corresp="#p_VGS1">GEORGE VEST</persName> that he is expecting the report, and Senator MANSFIELD mentions the need for a report in his December 3, 1975 letter to the President (Tab C). Criticism of our Diego Garcia expansion seems to have died down and there is great concern that failing to submit a report on April 15 would raise the issue again in the most disadvantageous context — the apparent failure of the Executive to comply with the express will (if not the legal requirement) of the Congress. A report pessimistic <pb n="2" xml:id="d93-02" facs="d93-02"/>on the prospects of Indian Ocean arms limitation would apparently be better than no report at all.</p>
                        <p>Before we can prepare the April 15 report to the Congress, we need a decision on what US Government policy is on this issue — do we want to commit ourselves to an initiative to the Soviets on Indian Ocean arms limitation or do we want instead to be negative on the idea. The <gloss target="#t_VPWG1">VPWG</gloss> report to the Verification Panel (revised version at Tab D) was prepared to provide the basis for this decision. The report presents four alternatives:
<list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Take no new US initiative for arms limitation in the Indian Ocean.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Make a unilateral declaration of restraint conditional upon reciprocal Soviet restraint.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Make a generalized approach to the Soviets.</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>Seek negotiations with the Soviets towards a bilateral Indian Ocean arms limitation agreement.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>While a Verification Panel meeting to review the <gloss target="#t_VPWG1">VPWG</gloss> paper could be desirable at some point, there seems to be general recognition (at least at the working level) that at the present time there is little prospect of any new arms limitation initiative. It might be useful, nonetheless, to send out the <gloss target="#t_VPWG1">VPWG</gloss> report to Verification Panel principals requesting official agency recommendations on which alternative we should pursue. This could be done rather quickly and would give everyone a chance to be heard on the issue. The <gloss target="#t_VPWG1">VPWG</gloss> could then proceed to draft the report to Congress. Alternatively, you could decide now that the US should take no new initiative (Alternative 1 in the <gloss target="#t_VPWG1">VPWG</gloss> paper) and direct the <gloss target="#t_VPWG1">VPWG</gloss> to begin preparing a draft of the April 15 report to Congress which supports this position.</p>

                        <p>I. PREFACE</p>
                        <p>For more than a decade, US security policy toward the Indian Ocean region has been influenced by three interrelated developments: the withdrawal of British military forces East of Suez; the increasing demand for Persian Gulf oil by US allies, and more recently, the United States itself; and the growth of Soviet military presence in the region.</p>
                        <p>Since 1949, the United States has maintained a limited permanent naval presence in the Indian Ocean area in the form of the flagship and two destroyers of Middle East Force (<gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>) stationed at Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. In the early and mid-1960s, as it became apparent that the British historical role was coming to an end, the United States initiated a policy of periodic naval deployments to the region. Although several naval contingents made flag-Showing excursions into the area at that time, and US forces occasionally participated in exercises, this policy was never fully implemented due to overriding requirements in Southeast Asia. In October 1973, however, in the aftermath of the Arab-Israel War and the Arab oil boycott, the United States sent a carrier task force into the northwest Indian Ocean, and shortly thereafter the Secretary of Defense announced the return to the previous US policy of more frequent and more regular naval deployments to the area.</p>
                        <p>The US had also begun to look for potentiaL support facilities in the area to help sustain an increased Level of deployments. In 1965, the British — with US encouragement and financial assistance — detached a number of islands from the colonial administrations of Mauritius and the Seychelles to form the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), and an agreement was concluded the following year to permit joint US-UK use of the islands for defense purposes. A limited communications station on the island of Diego Garcia was approved in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 and became operational in early 1973. In early 1974, the Administration requested Congressional authorization to expand the facilities at Diego Garcia. Funding for the first increment of this project was provided by the Congress in July 1975 and the expansion was formally approved by the British in February 1976.</p>
                        <p>Soviet naval activity in the Indian Ocean is a much more recent phenomenon. Although the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> actively pursued economic and <pb n="6" xml:id="d93-06" facs="d93-06"/>military assistance policies in the region from the mid-1950s, including harbor construction in Hodeidah and Berbera near the mouth of the Red Sea, the establishment of a significant Soviet naval presence first occurred in 1968. By 1972, the developing Soviet relationship with Somalia was becoming apparent as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> established a naval communications station at Berbera, and the frequency of Soviet ship visits to that port increased sharply. In early 1975, our intelligence identified Soviet construction of a major airfield and a missile storage and handling facility at Berbera. A re-analysis of intelligence data indicated that initial work on the missile facility had commenced in October 1973 and that planning for the Berbera installation must have preceded the Arab-Israel conflict.</p>
                        <p>During this period of a gradually expanding US and Soviet naval presence, pressure was building among the littoral states bordering the Indian Ocean for some form of arms limitation on the US and Soviet naval forces. In 1970 this pressure found expression in the Lusaka Declaration of the Non-Aligned Conference which called on all states to respect the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace from which great power competition would be excluded. Whether or not in response to the Declaration, in March 1971, Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin informally asked Secretary ROGERS for US views concerning a possible joint declaration on arms restraint in the Indian Ocean. In July 1971, US Ambassador Beam informed GROMYKO that we agreed in principle that it would be in our mutual interest to avoid military competition in the area and requested to know more specifically what the Soviets had in mind. GROMYKO was not prepared, asked that the discussion be postponed, and the subject has not subsequently been raised by the Soviets. In December 1971, the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> passed the first of its annual Indian Ocean Zone of Peace resolutions calling for the elimination of all major power military presence “conceived in the context of great power rivalry,” with the US, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and most other major maritime powers abstaining.</p>
                        <p>Considerable pressure for arms limitation in the Indian Ocean area has also appeared in the US Congress. During the 1974 debate over the expansion of the Diego Garcia facility, efforts were made to postpone the expansion until an arms limitation initiative was made to the Soviets. The effort failed, but a letter from the State Department to Senator Hart on July 15, 1975, stated that “…were the Diego Garcia matter resolved in such a way as to demonstrate that the US is determined, and has the means, to <pb n="7" xml:id="d93-07" facs="d93-07"/>protect its” security interests in the Indian Ocean … we would be prepared … to explore the possible methods of limitations which we have been discussing with the government.” A subsequent amendment to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76 Military Construction Appropriations Act (November 1975) prohibits the use of all but a small portion of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76 funds for Diego Garcia prior to April 15, 1976, and the conference language specifies that this action was taken “with the full expectation that the Administration will report (to the Congress) regarding initiatives” on mutual arms restraint in the Indian Ocean before that date.</p>
                        <p>In part to respond to this requirement, a Verification Panel Working Group was established in December 1975 to study the technical issues involved in arms limitations in the Indian Ocean and to examine alternative approaches to the problem.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d93-08" facs="d93-08"/>
                        <p>II. General Considerations</p>
                        <p>There are significant limits on what any arms limitations arrangement in the Indian Ocean could be expected to achieve. It is evident, for example, that even a very stringent limitation on naval forces would have very little effect on the ability of either side to provide support to dissident political movements in Africa or elsewhere. Soviet support for activities in Angola relied primarily on transport by air and sea which was — or could have been - - provided by civilian means. It is unrealistic to expect that a similar situation in Rhodesia, Mozambique, or elsewhere in the future could be prevented, or the course of events significantly changed, by the prior negotiation of a limitation on operational deployments. Conversely, any attempt to broaden the scope of negotiations to limit the political and material support that a superpower could provide its clients would in the current atmosphere be expected to get little support from the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>This is not to say that a US/Soviet arms limitation arrangement would have no impact on political relations in the area. The ability of each side to deploy and maintain credible military forces in the Indian Ocean is widely perceived by the littoral states and others as a tangible measure of superpower interest and involvement in regional affairs. Whether or not an arms limitations agreement would be welcomed by any littoral state depends on its own view of the value of superpower presence. Most nations in the area would probably at least pay lip service to the concept of mutual US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> military restraint, and some would be positively relieved to be free of the pressures of a big power arms race in the Indian Ocean. But those states which feel exposed, and which rely implicitly or explicitly on superpower presence to share up their own political security and stability, would certainly examine any agreement very carefully in terms of their own immediate interests. A significant reduction of superpower presence would certainly lead many states of the area to reexamine the concept of regional security in a new light.</p>
                        <p>The most direct impact of an arms limitation arrangement would be on the superpowers themselves, since such an arrangement would affect at least to some extent their ability to employ military power in pursuit of their own interests in the region. The degree to which this would influence the behavior of either power depends, of course, on the type of arrangement. A generalized declaration of mutual restraint would probably have relatively little impact, whereas the acceptance of explicit restrictions on deployment levels would probably lead to significant changes in present strategies, possibly including greater reliance on economic and diplomatic means and the temptation to use surrogates to achieve regional objectives.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d93-09" facs="d93-09"/>
                        <p>In negotiating any arrangement, a principal concern of both powers would be to avoid even the appearance of having institutionalized a set of conditions favoring its adversary or otherwise skewing the overall regional balance to its disadvantage. Any arrangement will be scrutinized for such evidence of imbalance by the regional states in terms of their own security, by allies and other external powers whose interests are involved, and by domestic interest groups in the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Given the very different perspectives of, for example, Pakistan, Indian, France, Japan, and various elements of the US Congress, almost any arrangement is certain to be controversial. The basic interests of the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the region are also sufficiently different to require a careful calculation of costs and benefits.</p>
                        <p>US Interests in the Indian Ocean Area</p>
                        <p>Previous studies have concluded that US interests in the Indian Ocean area are quite specific and of a lower order of priority than our interests in areas such as the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and Western Pacific. Our principal interest is to insure continued access to the oil of the Persian Gulf region for ourselves and our allies. At a minimum, this requires that states of the region remain free of predominant influence by forces hostile to our interests. Also, as part of our global relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, particularly in the wake of Angola and other evidences of a more aggressive Soviet interventionist policy, we have acquired an immediate interest in preventing the appearance of a major shift in the global military balance in favor of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This is particularly applicable in the Indian Ocean region where there are a number of likely targets for Soviet (or Cuban) attention. On the other hand, the Indian Ocean is geographically remote — being precisely the opposite side of the globe from the continental United States. Our vital interest in the oil resources of the area will probably peak within the next 10-20 years and then decline, as alternative energy sources begin to become available. The level of military force presence we can maintain in the region is severely limited. The Government of Bahrain has requested that we terminate our only permanent presence (<gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>) by mid-1977, and the future of this force is uncertain. While the airfield and port facilities at Diego Garcia could support a large military force presence if required, the assets available for deployment to the area are limited. At the present time, the US has only two attack carriers available on station to cover the entire Western Pacific and Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d93-10" facs="d93-10"/>
                        <p>Soviet interests in the Indian Ocean Area</p>
                        <p>Soviet interests are of quite a different nature. Geographically, the nations of the Persian Gulf and Indian Subcontinent lie immediately to the south of the Soviet border and have been the object of Russian imperial interest since the 16th century. The most economical sea route between European Russia and the Soviet Far East lies through the Suez Canal and Indian Ocean. This region was the site of the first major Soviet overtures to the Third World in the mid-1950s, and it was here that the Sino-Soviet schism first became publicly apparent at the time of the Sino-Indian border war in the early 1960s. The intense Soviet rivalry with China will continue to be a major factor in Soviet policy toward this area for the foreseeable future, as evidenced by repeated Soviet calls for an Asian security pact aimed at containment of Chinese influence. The range of geographical and political interests which have sustained a 20-year courtship of India insure that the Soviet leadership will continue to devote political, economic and military resources toward the achievement of their security objectives in the region indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Soviet Attitudes Toward Indian Ocean Arms Limitation</p>
                        <p>Soviet attitudes toward arms limitations in the area are ambivalent. It is apparent that the political leadership understands the advantages to be gained by at least maintaining the appearance of active interest in the subject, since it is regarded as a major issue by India and other regional states. However, it is very unlikely that the Soviet military — and particularly the Navy — find any merit in the idea. Soviet naval forces in the Indian Ocean currently operate without benefit of air cover — a serious handicap - and with the airfield facilities at Berbera still incomplete, they would rightly fear arms limitations discussions as interfering with their development of the “triad” of air-surface-subsurface capabilities prescribed in Soviet naval doctrine. They could be expected to argue internally that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be negotiating from a position of weakness and that acceptance of limitations would affect the long-term competition with China and the security of their own lines of communication across the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Soviet leadership has found it necessary or desirable in the past to pay lip service to the concept of mutual restraint, and they would consequently find it difficult to reject out of hand a US proposal which appeared to be more than a propaganda exercise. Based on Soviet statements to date, it appears that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might attempt to turn such talks to their own advantage by demanding the elimination of US “bases” on Diego Garcia and Bahrain, while insisting that the Berbera facility was for Somali <pb n="11" xml:id="d93-11" facs="d93-11"/>use and not in the same category. They might also insist that talks be broadened to include some or all of the littoral states, or they might insist that any agreement insure military “parity” between their own forces on the one hand and the combined forces of the US, UK, France, and possibly Australia, Iran and Pakistan on the other. In short, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> chose to sabotage such discussions or to exploit them solely for short-term propaganda objectives, there would be ample opportunity to do so.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there are some grounds for believing that if the US were to make an initiative, the Soviets might consider that their longterm interests would be served by negotiating seriously. Given the erosion of support for detente in the US, the Soviets might be anxious to show progress in the area of US/Soviet arms control, particularly if early SALT II and MBFR solutions appear unlikely. They may also wish to dispel any negative image which may have resulted from their actions in Angola and Somalia. Finally, they may be interested in limiting the naval competition in the Indian Ocean area on the belief that, at least in the short term, the advantages of such a competition might accrue to the US.</p>
                        <p>With this background, the principal arguments for and against possible arms limitation in the Indian Ocean can be summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>Principal Arguments for Possible Arms Limitation</p>
                        <p>An arrangement limiting force levels in the Indian Ocean provides a potentially effective and economical alternative to matching the expansion of Soviet military capability by a military buildup of our own. If such an arrangement were successful in restricting or preventing the introduction of Soviet land-based aircraft into the region, while possibly reducing or eliminating the Soviet submarine threat, the capability of Soviet naval forces would be significantly impaired and the probability of direct military confrontation would be reduced or shifted to other areas where US force levels are much stronger. In those circumstances, US interests in the Indian Ocean would be at least as secure as they are today, even at considerably reduced levels of military presence.</p>
                        <p>This option is particularly attractive at the present time when we are being forced to unilaterally reduce our military presence in the area due to budgetary constraints and competing requirements on our own limited naval forces and when <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> facilities in Bahrain may be lost. <pb n="12" xml:id="d93-12" facs="d93-12"/>If and when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> introduces land-based aircraft into the region, the need for a more frequent US carrier presence will increase if we are to maintain a credible balance with Soviet forces. Yet we will have only-two carriers available on station to cover the entire Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. Moreover, our long-term prospects of competing militarily with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> this region are not bright. Soviet interests are permanent and much more diverse than. ours, and the Soviets have demonstrated over more than years their willingness to invest significant political, economic and military capital in the region. It is recognized that there are many obstacles to achieving an effective agreement on arms limitations, but the problems will never be smaller or more manageable than they are today, before the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> completes the development of its facilities in Somalia. The present balance is in our favor, and we have the opportunity to seize the initiative in seeking an arrangement which would serve our own best interests.</p>
                        <p>A genuine US arms limitation initiative could have tangible benefits even if it ultimately failed. It would attract considerable support in Congress and among the littoral states, and a Soviet rejection would add credibility to any subsequent efforts to counter Soviet expansion by a buildup of US forces. It would serve to dramatize long-term Soviet intentions, and would provide an added incentive for regional states to resist Soviet efforts to acquire further base facilities on the littoral.</p>
                        <p>Principal Arguments Against Possible Arms Limitation</p>
                        <p>From all appearances, the Soviets are not truly interested in arms limitations, and the multiple asymmetries of force structure, basing, deployment patterns, and basic interests insure that they will have ample opportunities to sabotage any such initiative or turn it to their own short-term political and propaganda ends. In order to arrive at any mutually acceptable arrangement, we would have to be willing to make significant concessions in those areas where we have some advantage today, i.e., carrier forces and politically secure support facilities. This would be dangerous since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is geographically proximate to the area and could bring power to bear from its own territory for which we would have no counterpart. Moreover, any arrangement would provide little effective control on those areas of activity, e.g., covert support of dissident movements, military aid to expansionist regimes, use of surrogate forces, and other forms of disguised intervention at which the Soviets excel, and which pose the most significant threats to regional stability. Rather, an arms limitation arrangement might actually assist the Soviets in their covert efforts by providing apparent proof of Soviet claims that it seeks no dominant position <pb n="13" xml:id="d93-13" facs="d93-13"/>in the Indian Ocean area. Such cynical manipulation of an arms limitation arrangement by the Soviets could only foster further US domestic criticism of the US/Soviet relationship.</p>
                        <p>It is true that many of the potential threats to US interests in the region are essentially political and unrelated to the Soviet military presence -as was the oil boycott of 1973-74. The only previous blockade in the area was conducted by Egyptian, not Soviet, forces. Yet an agreement which established stringent limitations on US force deployments to the area would sharply curtail our flexibility to respond to such situations in the future.</p>
                        <p>Any formal arrangement which established limitations on naval activities on the basis of some form of parity could have undesirable consequences in other parts of the world. Such an arrangement could be interpreted as tacit acceptance of the Peace Zone proposal, thus lending credence to the concept that littoral states have the right to establish restrictions on adjacent areas of the high seas. It would encourage the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to press for similar restrictions in the Mediterranean, where our interests are much greater. And, it could establish the precedent for a Soviet attempt to impose global “parity” on the two navies. As a major maritime nation, we have more to lose in an exchange of naval concessions than does the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, which is still primarily a land power.</p>

                        <p>III. Findings</p>
                        <p>A. Comparative Military Presence US and Soviet Naval Ship Presence</p>
                        <p>The Soviet naval presence in the Indian Ocean normally exceeds in number of ships that of the US. Seven to eight Soviet naval combatant ships, including one or two destroyers, a submarine, two frigates, two minesweepers, and an amphibious ship, are nearly always in the area. These ships, which operate primarily in the northwestern part of the ocean, are accompanied by 8-12 assorted support ships. In addition, during 1974 and 1975, three to four combatant ships would occasionally operate in the Indian Ocean for a few months while transiting from one of the western Soviet fleets to the Pacific. The US naval. presence normally consists of two destroyers and a command support ship. Three to four times a year a US naval force, led by a cruiser or an aircraft carrier, operates for about six weeks in various parts of the ocean.</p>
                        <p>Ships of both countries constitute a visible naval presence in support of political objectives. Most Soviet ships spend most of their time at anchor near the Horn of Africa. From there, they conduct port visits to about ten countries each year, most of whose governments lean politically toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Until 1974, US ships conducted each year more port visits to about twice as many countries throughout the littoral than Soviet ships. In 1975, US ships made port calls to only 13 countries. The Soviet level of visits was comparable. Soviet naval forces normally in the Indian Ocean do not have much of a sea control or projection capability. Although greatly superior in number to the normal US naval presence, Soviet ships would have only marginal military capabilities against the US cruiser group and would be no match for the US carrier force which deploys there during alternate quarters. The Soviets increase their naval presence in the Indian Ocean during periods of tension in response to US task force deployments. They normally conduct active surveillance of US task forces in the area.</p>
                        <p>There are military as well as political reasons for a presence of US and Soviet forces in the Indian Ocean. A continuous naval presence affords a superpower the ability to take some immediate naval action to support its interests and provides a foundation for the introduction of additional forces into the area in the event of a crisis. The US naval presence supports US interests ashore and reflects a desire to protect the shipment of oil from the Persian Gulf. The Soviets have the capability to support their interests <pb n="15" xml:id="d93-15" facs="d93-15"/>in certain countries, assist their clients and deploy additional forces to counter-balance US naval forces during a crisis. Past periods of tension have shown that the Soviet Navy's main mission in the Indian Ocean would be the destruction of US carrier forces.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have also voiced great concern over the threat from US SSBNs which they say operate in the Indian Ocean. It appears that they are seriously concerned about the potential deployment of US SSBNs to the area. The normal Soviet naval force in the area, though not structured primarily for ASW, is capable of limited anti-submarine warfare operations. On the other hand, the US is concerned over the potential threat which uncontested Soviet submarine forces could pose to US and NATO oil shipments.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">US and Soviet Shore-Based Facilities</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>US and Soviet naval forces rely primarily on their own ships for logistic support in the Indian Ocean. Soviet ships obtain most of their fuel oil and supplies from their own replenishment tankers, but they occasionally purchase fresh food and water during port visits. Communications relay services are in part provided to Soviet ships by the facility at Berbera. Soviet repair ships enable the Soviets to make minor repairs at anchor. The recent delivery of a floating drydock to Berbera; however, now makes it possible for the Soviets to make major repairs in the Indian Ocean for the first time. The Soviets have a limited capability to transfer ammunition at sea, but would have to obtain missiles from the missile-handling facility at Berbera. The Soviets are only slowly developing a capacity for sustained combat operations at sea. Although storage facilities ashore are valuable for resupply, during prolonged conflict combatant naval forces need to be resupplied at sea while underway if they are to remain a viable force after an initial exchange. Most Soviet naval support ships do not have an alongside underway replenishment capability and most of them are unarmed. These limitations of Soviet support ships are tangible indications that Soviet naval strategy has only recently begun to address the requirement for a capability to conduct extended combat operations in distant areas.</p>
                        <p>The two US destroyers which normally operate in the Indian Ocean purchase fuel oil, fresh food and water from littoral countries. The other US naval forces that periodically deploy to the area rely primarily on their own support ships which have modern and extensive replenishment capabilities. Communication relay services are provided mainly by the station at Diego Garcia. The Diego Garcia expansion will provide significant fuel storage capacity and temporary berthing for US ships.</p>
                        <pb n="16" xml:id="d93-16" facs="d93-16"/>
                        <p>Shore-based facilities improve each navy's command and control and logistic capabilities and enable ships to lengthen deployment times, resulting in a more effective and economic utilization of assets. Pre-positioned supplies are presently inadequate to support either navy during a prolonged period of tension. In such a case, both the US and Soviet navies would have to rely on their own logistic supply chains for support, Soviet operational resupply capabilities are presently inferior to those of the US.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Surge Capability Into the Indian Ocean</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>US and Soviet ships in the Eastern Mediterranean could deploy to the Arabian Sea through the Suez Canal in less than five days. The Soviets probably could send a superior force because most US carriers could not pass through the canal. If the canal is closed, the US would be in the best position of all the major non-littoral naval powers to quickly deploy additional naval forces into the Indian Ocean. Under normal conditions, a US carrier task group from the Pacific Fleet can be in the eastern Indian Ocean within five days. Such a capability was demonstrated to some extent during the India-Pakistan war of 1971 when a US carrier task group arrived in the Bay of Bengal on four days notice. During the Mid-East war in 1973, a US carrier task group arrived in the vicinity of the Gulf of Oman within 12 days after receipt of its orders.</p>
                        <p>If naval forces in the Eastern Mediterranean are discounted, the Soviets could not be as responsive. It would take Soviet surface ships approximately ten days and submarines 15-20 days to reach the entrance to the Indian Ocean from home ports in the Pacific Fleet. Soviet surface ships could sail to the Arabian Sea from the Black Sea in a few days less if the canal is open. During the two identifiable surge deployments of Soviet naval ships to the Indian Ocean (1971 and 1973), it took Soviet ships and submarines at least 10 and 15 days respectively to arrive in the Indian Ocean. (The Suez Canal was closed in both cases.)</p>
                        <p>British and French naval forces are in a much less responsive position. With the canal open they could deploy some ships to the Indian Ocean in two to three weeks. With the canal closed, it would take over a month for forces to reach the northern portion of the Arabian Sea. Neither nation responded to the recent Middle East conflict or the Indo-Pak war.</p>

                        <p>Neither the US nor the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has military aircraft permanently stationed in countries on the Indian Ocean littoral. Aircraft of both countries, however, conduct flights into the area.</p>
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="d93-17" facs="d93-17"/>
                        <p>Since 1968 the Soviets have conducted occasional U-95 Bear D flights over the Indian Ocean from bases in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, overflying Iran. The declared mission of the aircraft has been support for space events, but area familiarization, training, and reconnaissance support for Soviet warships probably have been their missions. In 1975, US carriers were overflown by two such aircraft for the first time. In addition to this air activity, during the past year the Soviets have sent IL-38 May aircraft to Somalia on three occasions for approximately nine days. While in Somalia these aircraft conducted one or two anti-submarine warfare or ocean surveillance flights over the Indian Ocean. In total, Soviet military aircraft conducted almost 20 sorties<note n="*" target="d93fn*">A sortie is defined as a single flight by a single aircraft.</note> over the Indian Ocean during 1975.</p>
                        <p>The US started sending P-3 Orion aircraft into the Indian Ocean area in 1972. These ocean surveillance and anti-submarine warfare flights are flown from Diego Garcia and Iran. The aircraft stage to Diego Garcia via Thailand. In 1975 the US conducted about ten times as many sorties in the area as the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Despite the greater number of US sorties, the Soviets have the capability to conduct flights from Somalia, and from their bases in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (the latter subject to overflight restrictions). Moreover, Soviet anti-ship strike aircraft are capable of carrying out missions over the northern Indian Ocean from bases in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. If strike aircraft were deployed to Somalia, they could pose an even more serious threat to US naval forces in a conflict.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Combat Ground Forces</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither the US nor the Soviets have stationed combat ground forces in countries on the Indian Ocean littoral. Overseas deployment of ground combat forces, while not unusual for the US, is rare for the Soviets. More common would be the deployment of amphibious ships with embarked combat troops. Even this has not been done in the Indian Ocean area by either country. But a limited potential exists, though the United States would have a significant advantage because of its larger and more capable amphibious forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Presence of Other Forces</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In terms of ship days, the French have the largest naval presence of any external power in the Indian Ocean. In terms of ship tonnage, they are nearly equal to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="d93-18" facs="d93-18"/>
                        <p>The French force permanently stationed in the Indian Ocean normally includes a command support ship, three frigates, five or six patrol boats, an amphibious ship and a support ship. This force is periodically augmented by short-term deployments from France of a few destroyers and, on occasion, an aircraft carrier. Recently, France announced plans to station two submarines at Djibouti.</p>
                        <p>The French naval presence, however, may become difficult to sustain. French ships in the past received extensive support from facilities at Diego Suarez and Djibouti. They no longer have naval access in Malagasy and France will soon grant independence to the Territory of the Afars and Issas (TFAI). Though France desires to maintain control of the fuel storage and repair facilities in Djibouti, this may not be politically possible once the TFAI becomes independent. Even if the permanent naval presence in the Indian Ocean is reduced, the French Navy can be expected to make periodic major deployments to the area.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the French, the UK does not maintain a permanent afloat naval presence in the Indian Ocean. Four or five frigates of the Royal Navy occasionally deploy to the Far East and from there make periodic short-term port visits in the Indian Ocean. Future deployments are expected to occur less frequently and for shorter durations because of economies imposed on the Royal Navy.</p>
                        <p>The British have no ship repair facilities in the Indian Ocean. They will rely on the communications facility at Diego Garcia after they close their station in Mauritius this April. The UK also plans to withdraw from its two airfields at Gan and Masira by 1977.</p>
                        <p>The six principal littoral naval powers in terms of ship inventories are Indonesia, Iran, India, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa. Five of these six countries are generally disposed toward the US. Ships of these navies have normally operated near home waters, although India made good use of her fleet in blockading Dacca during the India-Pakistan war, and Iran is training her fleet to insure access to the Strait of Hormuz. In the future, the navies of Iran and India will increase in both size and capability. The Indian fleet remains the more substantial although it is unable to match the capability of a US carrier task force deployed to the area.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>During the past five years, the Soviets have gradually increased their naval presence in the Indian Ocean (though their total deployments declined in 1975). Future levels are uncertain. The Soviets can be <pb n="19" xml:id="d93-19" facs="d93-19"/>expected to increase their naval presence during a crisis situation and to respond in some degree to major Western initiatives in the area. To a considerable extent future Soviet naval capabilities may depend on the evolution of their relations with Somalia. In 1980 the Soviets are-expected to station reconnaissance, ASW and perhaps strike aircraft in Somalia if the Somali government does not feel threatened by a greater Soviet presence. Somalia is the only Indian Ocean littoral country where current circumstances suggest that the Soviet Navy is likely to make significant gains in access to shore facilities in the near term. The deployment of Soviet strike aircraft to the region would represent a significant change in the combat capabilities of the Soviet naval units operating in the area. Soviet naval doctrine calls for close coordination of land-based aircraft with its surface and subsurface forces, and the availability of air cover to complete the “triad” prescribed in Soviet doctrine would be the single development most likely to affect the relative US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> military balance in the near future.</p>
                        <p>In South Yemen, the Soviet Navy will continue to seek landing and overflight rights for contingencies to supplement the Somali airfields. Aden, however, has resisted Soviet overtures for a substantially expanded military presence. Iraq probably will continue to permit the replenishment and periodic maintenance of Soviet ships in its ports, but will provide little else even if more is requested. Although the Soviets have been permitted sporadic visits to Indian ports, New Delhi has not granted the Soviet Navy free access to the ports or repair facilities and has rejected Moscow's attempts to use Indian airfields for “space support”. Soviet prospects for regular access to any Indian facilities are dim in the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>The US naval ship presence in the Indian Ocean decreased in 1975 after an all-time high in 1974. Planning for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76 called for Pacific Fleet deployments of combatant groups once each quarter, alternating carrier and surface combatant forces. The fourth quarter <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76 carrier deployment was cancelled, and current planning for future years will probably result in a reduction of PacFlt deployments to three combatant groups per year, including only one carrier deployment, due to budgetary restrictions and draw down of available carrier resources in the Pacific. US naval presence may decline further if <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> is required to terminate its use of facilities in Bahrain by mid-1977 as requested by the <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss>. Flights of maritime aircraft are likely to remain about the same, although the facilities at Diego Garcia when completed will provide better logistic support to US naval and air forces in the event of contingency situations.</p>

                        <p>Indian Ocean arms limitation arrangements could have precedential effects which would be damaging to US interests in other areas, such as our position with regard to Freedom of the Seas, and the on-going Law of the Sea negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 122 recognized national security as the preeminent US oceans policy interest, and as a consequence, a central objective of US oceans policy is to preserve high seas freedoms — the unfettered movement of our vessels and aircraft (commercial and military) on, under, and over the high seas.</p>
                        <p>To avoid creating legal precedents which might damage our position on freedom of the seas, any Indian Ocean arms limitation arrangement:
<list>
                                <item>— Should be clearly presented as a voluntary and limited contractual relationship undertaken between the parties that in no way prejudices their rights with regard to freedom of the seas, or imparts rights to third-party states. It should be couched in such a way that it is not perceived as a statement of generally applicable international law, but rather a contract between states regarding certain limited naval matters of mutual interest.</item>
                                <item>— Should contain language specifically stating that the arrangement in no way affects the parties' positions with regard to freedom of the seas.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Certain political effects on our freedom of the seas position may flow from most kinds of Indian Ocean arms limitation arrangements, giving further impetus to the current trend toward encroachment upon rights with respect to the high seas.
<list>
                                <item>— Any arrangement when viewed against the background of repeated <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly resolutions, calling for an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace, could be viewed as tacit acceptance of the general concept that coastal states have a right to regulate activities of other nations in high seas areas adjacent to their territorial waters.</item>
                                <item>— By appearing to be a weakening of the US position on freedom of the seas, Indian Ocean arms limitation might encourage further support for demands for a 200-mile limit for territorial seas. It might also undercut <pb n="21" xml:id="d93-21" facs="d93-21"/>the US position favoring free transit through and over international straits, encouraging Indonesia and Malaysia, for example, to stiffen their demand for prior notification of transits through the Strait of Malacca.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The extent to which precedents (either legal or political) would be created by an Indian Ocean arms limitation arrangement would vary depending on the form of the arrangement. A properly worded Declaration of Restraint would raise the fewest problems, since it would be a statement of intention rather than a legally binding agreement. However, even this could be interpreted as a weakening of our position on Freedom of the Seas. On the other end of the spectrum, a formal agreement would be more difficult. With appropriate disclaimers, an agreement could avoid any damaging legal precedents. But it would be more likely to give impetus to some of the adverse political effects discussed above by giving the impression that the US was willing to accept restrictions on its rights in the Indian Ocean, and perhaps elsewhere. A prime candidate would be the Mediterranean where the Soviets have already called for arms control. It would be more difficult to resist pressures for limits in the Mediterranean (despite our more obvious commitments and interests there) in the face of concessions previously made in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>Relationship to Other Negotiations</p>
                        <p>The potential impact of Indian Ocean arms limitation on other on-going negotiations is important enough to warrant special consideration.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>— The third substantive session of the Law of the Sea Conference began on March 15. We would not want at this stage to create expectations of concessions (on such issues as passage through straits and the extent of the territorial sea) which in fact will not be forthcoming. An Indian Ocean arms limitation initiative runs the risk of doing just that.</item>
                            <item>— The inclusion of a limitation on submarine deployments in the Indian Ocean would restrict the deployment areas of US SSBNs. Acceptance of such a restriction could establish a precedent for similar restrictions in other geographic areas or on other strategic systems.</item>
                            <item>— If the US were to accept a relatively “soft” level of verification as part of an Indian Ocean arms limitation arrangement, this could provide a basis for stiffened Soviet resistance to our requirement of “hard” verification provisions in the SALT and MBFR negotiations.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>An Indian Ocean arms limitation arrangement could be aimed simply at restraining peacetime naval competition between the US and the Soviets. In this situation the parties might want to include a provision permitting them to suspend or adjust the terms of the arrangement in time of crisis. Such a clause would, however, probably draw fire from the littoral states by appearing to be an explicit assertion of the right of the US and the Soviets to intervene militarily in the Indian Ocean area.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, force limitations could be established on a flexible basis (e.g., yearly averaging) which would permit force levels to fluctuate from day to day. Each side would then be able to “budget” its in-area deployments and hold some of its allotment in reserve for crisis contingencies. Thus, the need for a crisis escape clause would be reduced, and the arms limitation arrangement would not only minimize peacetime competition but also constrain the a bility of the parties to reinforce in time of crisis. To constrain this reinforcement capability still further, the arrangement might include a limit on the size of these crisis deployments (couched, perhaps, in terms of total number of ships and/or total tonnage). Even under this approach, the parties' freedom of action in grave situations could be protected by including a provision for withdrawal in case of a threat to a party's “supreme national interests.”</p>
                        <p>Under either approach to the crisis deployment problem, a mechanism for consultations between the parties might be desirable, to deal with possible minor violations and with situations which might lead to crisis deployments by either party.</p>

                        <p>Since the only other states outside the Indian Ocean littoral (other than the US and the Soviets) that deploy naval ships into the area are the UK and France, the Soviets are likely to argue that any arms limitation arrangement should provide for parity between Soviet deployments on the one hand and aggregate US, French, and British naval deployments on the other. The US would want to firmly resist this approach, which could only result in a net reduction in the Western naval presence vis-à-vis the Soviets. We would want to insist that any arrangement be limited to US and Soviet forces If the Soviets were unwilling to fall off their demand (as they were in SALT). We would have to consider whether it was worth accommodating their concern. If so, one of the following alternatives might help:</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="d93-23" facs="d93-23"/>
                        <list>
                            <item>— Make restraints (both US and Soviet) loosely contingent on the maintenance of current levels of all extra-regional deployments.</item>
                            <item>— Ask extra-regional powers to associate themselves with the intent if not the terms of a US-Soviet arrangement by unilateral declarations of their own.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>While the US would not want to include France and the UK in any formal way in the discussions, we would want to consult with them prior to initiating talks with the Soviets. We would probably also want to consult with Japan and Australia, and to assure other friendly states (e.g., Iran and Saudi Arabia) that US aid programs would not be affected by the talks.</p>
                        <p>Participation by Littoral States</p>
                        <p>In addition to seeking a limit on UK and French deployments, the Soviets might also seek to cover the Australian fleet. The US could probably resist this demand without much difficulty by countering with a demand to include the Indian Navy, arguing that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s special relationship with India is similar to the US/Australian tie.</p>
                        <p>Whether to include the littoral states generally involves two separate issues:
<list>
                                <item>— what role, if any, should the littoral states play in a US-Soviet negotiation; and</item>
                                <item>— what would be the utility of a multilateral negotiation leading to an arrangement designed to limit all navies in the area.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Apart from the possible desirability of advising certain states at some point that discussions had taken place, there are a number of good reasons not to involve the littoral states in US/Soviet discussions. The principal one is that it would greatly complicate the negotiations and reduce the chances of reaching an acceptable limitation arrangement. The Soviets would be tempted to convert the discussions into a propaganda forum and join with some of the littoral states in advocating the removal of all foreign bases from the area — pressuring us on Diego Garcia while steadfastly denying their own facilities in Somalia. Also, inclusion of littoral states in whatever form might be construed as tacit acceptance of their right to regulate activities on adjacent high seas areas.</p>
                        <p>Inclusion of littoral states would make sense only if the US wanted to press for a multilateral arrangement under which all extra-regional <pb n="24" xml:id="d93-24" facs="d93-24"/>naval powers and all littoral states (or all littoral states with large navies) would agree to limit their deployments or exercise restraint in expanding their fleets. There is little chance that the principal littoral states would agree to such an arrangement. Pressure for an Indian Ocean “Zone of Peace” has been intended solely to exclude external powers, not to establish an intra-area arms limitation regime. While there might be scenarios in which a call for area-wide limitation including littoral states might have some tactical advantages in resisting pressure to exclude us from the area, for the present and foreseeable future the littoral fleets will remain of such modest capability as to pose little threat to US interests in the area — even if US deployments were to be limited at current levels under a US/Soviet bilateral limitation arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Verification</p>
                        <p>Verification of any limitation arrangement would presumably be by national technical means. Using existing systems, our verification capabilities would vary depending on the item subject to limitation.

                            <item>SUMMARY: Senior Maldivian officials are disturbed over status of employees and facilities at former RAF staging facility on Gan Island which have become their problem with final British withdrawal March 31. Hopes that British would provide money to maintain operation have not been realized no do prospects of converting Han into tourist complex appear good. President <persName corresp="#p_NI1">Nasir</persName> claimed GOM cannot maintain burden over time and Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Maniku</persName> noted that Soviet Union had expressed interest in Gan, presumably for military purposes. Neither <persName corresp="#p_NI1">Nasir</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Maniku</persName> ruled <pb n="2" xml:id="d94-02" facs="d94-02"/>out possibility that such use might be granted. We are not certain GOM would in fact come to agreement with soviet but we recommend Washington examine how Soviet military use of Gan might affect U.S. interests. END SUMMARY</item>

                            <item>During Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_VC1">VAN HOLLEN</persName>'s April 14-15 farewell visit to Maldives, discussions with senior Maldivians brought out deep concern over problems arising from March 31 final British withdrawal from RAF Gan. At start of Ambassador's call on President <persName corresp="#p_NI1">Nasir</persName>, President raised Gan noting that although other economic prospects for his country had improved, Gan had become difficult problem. He said GOM had to maintain work force of 140 men merely to keep facilities in working order with no return to Maldivians, <persName corresp="#p_NI1">Nasir</persName> mentioned possibility that Gan might be turned into tourist complex but then noted that business would be seasonal, would require large annual investment for limited returns during tourist months and he doubted whether charter tour operators would be willing to cover yearly costs. Only solution, according to <persName corresp="#p_NI1">Nasir</persName>, was to workout some type of agreement either with commercial organizations or with some other country. In reply to Ambassador's direct query whether agreements would be in tourist context rather than military use, President was <pb n="3" xml:id="d94-03" facs="d94-03"/>noncommittal and did not rule out third country use for military purposes.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Subject of Gan arose again during Ambassador's call on Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Ali Maniku</persName> who has been carrying on negotiations with British regarding Gan withdrawal. <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Maniku</persName> stated problem in these terms: although British had left assets on Gan in form of facilities and equipment worth over 11 million pounds, GOM will have to spend 46,000 pounds per year to maintain facilities in running order, cost which GOM cannot sustain over time. Talks have been held with various groups with view to developing Gan as tourist complex, but nothing, concrete has come out of them. <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Maniku</persName> insisted the present situation could not continue. He said Maldivians would prefer not to have to turn to any major power to solve Gan problem. However, to maintain Gan at no cost to GOM, and employment found some way must be found for trained labor from RAF Gan who were now out of work and who had been used to higher British salaries. <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Maniku</persName> implied British had left workers in lurch and he made it clear that GOM no longer considers defense treaty with <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> valid.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>When asked by Ambassador whether Can's use for other than for tourist purposes would be contemplated, <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Maniku</persName> said GOM would have to solve <pb n="4" xml:id="d94-04" facs="d94-04"/>problem in whatever way was open to it. If British/Americans refused to accept responsibility for maintaining Gan, and if no group was interested in developing Gan as tourist complex, then GOM would have whomever might help. He said Soviets had expressed interest in Gan but did not go into details. When Ambassador suggested Indians might not necessarily be pleased with Soviet use, <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Maniku</persName> reiterated that Soviets had shown interest and suggested that Indians, who he pictured as being heavily under Soviet influence, might be planning some sort of joint use with Soviets.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>COMMENT: Problem of what to do with Gan is obviously weighing heavily on minds of many senior Maldivians. It is difficult to judge whether they although would, in fact, turn Gan over to Russians, neither President <persName corresp="#p_NI1">Nasir</persName> nor Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MA8">Maniku</persName> would rule out this possibility. In view Maldivian requirement that programs or projects should pay their own way, GOM might well be tempted to enter arrangement with Soviets, Indians or others for military use of Gan facilities if it felt price was right.</item>

                            <item>Action Recommended: We recommend that Washington agencies promptly take another close look at Gan and consider (A) degree to which its use by unfriendly power would adversely affect U.S. interests, <pb n="5" xml:id="d94-05" facs="d94-05"/>particularly with reference to its proximity to Diego Garcia and U.S. objectives in Indian Ocean and (B) alternatives for U.S. policy.</item>

                        <p>FINAL DRAFT</p>
                        <p>Sri Lanka Policy Guidance Paper</p>
                        <p>April 16, 1976</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">I. Overview</p>
                        <p>A small and poor country, Sri Lanka in the 1970s has faced two broad challenges. Externally, the key to its effective independence and sovereignty lies in the state of its relations with India. The Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka historically has been acutely conscious of its vulnerability to its giant neighbor. A cautious deference to Delhi where India's prestige and basic interests are involved and reciprocal Indian sensitivity to Sri Lanka concerns, especially on the Tamil minority problem, have yielded a good bilateral relationship, largely free of the frictions that plague India's relations with its other South Asian neighbors.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, Sri Lanka's chronically poor economic and financial position has created an urgent need for large-scale external aid. A non-aligned but pragmatic foreign policy has been the mechanism through which Sri Lanka has sought aid from both East and West and the broad-based support which reminds India that the Ceylonese have other windows on the world. Equally important, the longstanding commitment to non-alignment has expanded Sri Lanka's external horizon from a regional perspective with India as its focus, to global issues and a worldwide network of diplomatic contacts. In the process Sri Lanka's freedom of action has increased, enabling it to carve out its own sphere of initiative within the non-aligned movement.</p>
                        <p>The current cordial state of U.S.-Sri Lanka relations contrasts with earlier strains caused by expropriation problems and ideological friction. We have worked hard to overcome the initial suspicion of U.S. intentions and motives within Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName>'s socialist-oriented government while stressing the compatibility of U.S. interests with Ceylonese non-alignment. We accept the <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss>'s posture as adding to stability in South Asia and offering us equal access in dealing with Sri Lanka as an Indian Ocean state and a Third World moderate. We have adopted a low profile in Sri Lanka, a self-denying posture which is important to the Ceylonese as it reduces opportunities and the rationale for other powers (i.e., India, PRC,<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) to seek a dominant position in Sri Lanka.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d95-02" facs="d95-02"/>
                        <p>In turn, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BSRD1">Bandaranaike</persName> has taken the lead within the <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss> in reorienting Sri Lanka's relations with the U.S. but leftist opposition remains strong. Our present relationship is thus delicately balanced and will remain so even if the more conservative opposition should form a government after the 1977 parliamentary elections. Our aim will be to consolidate our improved relations, but slowly and with no sudden expansion of U.S. involvement or resources.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">II. Major U.S. Interests</p>
                        <p>Sri Lanka impinges directly on our interest: (a) in encouraging regional stability in South Asia: (b) in balancing the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean region; (c) in evolving a constructive relationship and dialogue with non-aligned Third World countries on a variety of multilateral issues. However, the Ceylonese capacity to function in a manner which complements U.S. objectives in all three areas and which supports specific assets such as our VOA facilities rests on the viability and evenhandedness of Sri Lanka's non-aligned posture.</p>
                        <p>Our interest lies in promoting a politically stable and economically viable Sri Lanka whose internal strength offers no vacuum for an outside power to exploit. While accepting Indian preponderance in South Asia, we have no wish to see a neighboring state such as Sri Lanka lose its capacity to maintain its own independent policies. Our bilateral relationship is important to both countries independently of each other's relations with India.</p>
                        <p>We wish to see Sri Lanka avoid a condition of dependence on others which could jeopardize the <gloss target="#t_GSL1">GSL</gloss>'s existing policy of not permitting foreign military facilities in Sri Lanka. Such a development would seriously disturb the strategic situation in South Asia and the Indian Ocean generally and, could undermine our naval ships' current access to Sri Lanka for shore leave and bunkering services, a valuable asset in maintaining our naval presence in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Sri Lanka's prominence in the non-aligned movement has enhanced the value of our bilateral ties as a channel for encouraging a moderate LDC stance on issues directly affecting American interests. Sri Lanka's role as host of the 1976 Non-Aligned Summit Conference, as Chairman of the Coordinating Secretariat of the Non-Aligned Movement, as likely President of the 1976 <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, its leadership in key fora such as the Law of the Sea negotiations, UNCTAD, Group of 77, illustrate its exceptional involvement in multilateral affairs. Our bilateral ties to Sri Lanka thus have a significance and value to U.S. multilateral interests beyond the normal scope of relations with a small country.</p>

                            </hi>: That's not my fault.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, for the Non-Aligned Conference. I thought it would be useful to talk to you beforehand.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Yes (turning to <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>), he is a former student of mine, but not as spectacular as his successor. What happened to her?</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, Jane Rajasingha. She's now in the ILO. She's divorced and has remarried.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What about the others?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: One is a Clerk of our Parliament. This is an important job.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: And Fernando?</p>

                            </hi>: He is now head of the Tea Research Board.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: That's not something he learned at Harvard, not from me at least. We are gradually infiltrating this place. Now we need you as Foreign Minister.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: No, I would want to stay as Ambassador.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: It is starting August 9. The Foreign Ministers meet August 12 and the Summit starts August 16.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Why not invite me?</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We'd like to invite you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: But it wouldn't be a good idea for me to be there just before the Non-Aligned Summit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: I agree, but you and Nancy should come sometime. You know there is an old saying that Sri Lanka is supposed to be 40 miles from Paradise.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Really! (Turning to Atherton) Have you been there?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>
                            </hi>: No. I've been trying unsuccessfully to organize a Chiefs of Mission meeting there for the past couple of years.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Now on the Non-Aligned meeting. I think the Non-Aligned are playing a dangerous game if they organize into a tight pressure camp. They are bound to do something that will cause us to respond in a strong way. Puerto Rico is something we cannot accept as an international issue. We will take it as an unfriendly act if countries pass resolutions on this. I think we would not participate in a session of the General Assembly if it voted an unfriendly resolution. That gives you some idea of the strength of our sentiments on this issue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: On Puerto Rico, we have no differences with your position. We believe in self-determination as a matter of principle and know that the Puerto Ricans have expressed their views. It is not for us to become involved. At Algiers, the Ministers endorsed the previous Lima resolution. They said the Puerto Rican people were entitled to self-determination and independence. We are not happy about this and speaking for the Government of Sri Lanka, I can say that we will try to adjust the language at the Summit to eliminate the mention of independence. This would have the effect of making the resolution meaningless as the Puerto Ricans already have self-determination. We recognize that this is an internal U.S. matter</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: On what basis can Cuba be in the Non-Aligned?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: The original definition was to include countries outside of multilateral military alliances.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d96-03" facs="d96-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What about the South Koreans?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: They probably would be O.K.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Spain?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: They have asked to send an observer. So has Switzerland. We have objected to efforts to establish a secretariat. They would institutionalize the Non-Aligned group. We want to maintain independence of either super power. Rumania wants to join but can't because it is a member of the Warsaw Pact. If we let them in, then we would also have to allow Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Is India a part of the group? With them hegemony is O.K. but alliances are not. What about China?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: As a major power, China could not join. The purpose originally was to gather together a group of countries that would look at issues on their merits and not in accord with Bloc views.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: The Non-Aligned has become more of a bloc than the alliances. There is a high degree of commensurability.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: On economic matters, the countries subscribe to rather broad principles on commodities and other issues but they have little in common except for these broad principles, such as stable commodity prices. A case in point are Brazil and Sri Lanka. If coffee is in trouble, tea is helped. But my Government wants to focus on economic issues. It has been our approach all along to deal with issues on a pragmatic basis. That's why we were willing to upset the Indians in 1971. We allowed Pakistani planes to land when they were ferrying troops to East Pakistan. We always felt that they should be able to communicate with other parts of their country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: The day will come when India will regret what it did in 1971. I have always felt that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: We were one of the last to recognize Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Is that also true regarding Angola?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: That's a different case.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: It is a question of Cuban troops.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: But on Puerto Rico there is no problem between us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I didn't think so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: I have been instructed by the Prime Minister to do what we can to deal with the Puerto Rican problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Another is Korea. We hope that the Non-Aligned will not adopt a pro-North Korean resolution which amounts to taking sides. We would prefer that the issue not be raised at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: We abstained on both resolutions last year. Our position is that the North and the South should enter into bilateral discussions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: That's essentially our position. We are prepared to abolish the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command but we want it to be replaced by some legal instrumentality.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Kanakaratne</persName>
                            </hi>: The Prime Minister may be at a disadvantage if Kaunda and Nyerere are not present. Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore will be there but Suharto of Indonesia will be away because of their Independence Day.</p>
                        <p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Yes, I will be back August 15.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: It's not yet decided. I may have to go to Africa again.</p>

                            </hi>: In my discussions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubs</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName> we also talked about the Middle East issue. I can report that together with India and Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka worked at Lima to avoid an expulsion resolution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: This is also an explosive issue, not only in regard to foreign policy but here in the U.S. There should be no doubt about that.</p>

                            </hi>: I don't know what impact the Uganda business will have. I am not sure if you saw the Sri Lanka statement which both condemns the violation of Uganda territory and highjacking. I think on this issue we will definitely try for a balanced resolution if it comes up. Colombo is well aware of your sentiments on key issues. This is one reason why I and Shirley Amerasinghe have been called back.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Those are the big issues but we have a general interest that the Non-Aligned remain genuinely non-aligned. Now Castro is even to the left of Moscow.</p>

                            </hi>: We are aware. We don't want the Summit to be used by others to pull their chestnuts out.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Yes, we have a first-class conference hall built by your friends the Chinese. We also have enough hotel space. In fact, this is not the tourist season and the Government has closed off the island from visitors.</p>

                            </hi>: No, but the rains have been delayed and the monsoon is just beginning. It is late and is affecting our crops, while India has had a good harvest. I want to assure you that we have no intention of upsetting our good bilateral relations.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: You know our interest in these and we are aware of the limits of what you can do, but just keep our interests in mind.</p>

                            </hi>: We have, but you never come. We tried to get you before.</p>

                        <p>1. BRITISH POL COUNSELOR SCOTT CALLED ON DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY DUBS JULY 23 TO PRESENT SPEAKING NOTE OUTLINING BRITISH RESPONSE TO MALDIVIAN INTENTION TO TERMINATE 1965 ANGLO-MALDIVIAN DEFENSE AGREEMENT.</p>
                        <p>2. NOTE REVIEWS EARLY GOM ASSURANCES THAT AGREEMENT, INCLUD- ING ITS THIRD PARTY EXCLUSION PROVISION, WOULD REMAIN OPERATIVE AFTER RAF WITHDRAWAL FROM GAN. FOLLOWING MARCH 31 WITHDRAWAL, HOWEVER, MALDIVIANS NOTIFIED <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> IN MAY 9 LETTER FROM PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NI1">NASIR</persName> TO PRIME MINISTER THAT AGREEMENT WAS ENDED, DECISION WHICH NOTE ATTRIBUTES TO FINANCIAL STRAIN FOR GOM OF MAINTAINING GAN. NOTE ACKNOWLEDGES MALDIVIAN APPROACHES TO OTHER GOVERNMENTS, IRAN IN PARTICU- LAR, ADDING THAT GOM HAS NOT RULED OUT IRANIAN AIR BASE GIVEN IRANIAN INQUIRIES ABOUT POSSIBLE <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> OBJECTIONS TO MOVING INTO GAN. BRITISH APPEAR UNWILLING TO OBJECT TO THIS DEVELOPMENT ON GROUNDS, AS STA ED BY NOTE, THAT “IT COULD BE EMBARRASSING TO OUR RELATIONS WITH THE SHAH” TO STAND ON RIGHTS UNDER THE 1965 AGREEMENT.</p>
                        <p>
                            <del rend="strikethrough">CONFIDENTIAL</del>

                        <p>PAGE 02 STATE 187309</p>
                        <p>3. BRITISH POINT OUT THAT THE AGREEMENT MAKES NO PROVISION FOR UNILATERAL TERMINATION BUT STATE THAT A STRICTLY LEGAL POSITION WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON <persName corresp="#p_NI1">NASIR</persName>'S ATTITUDE. IN ANY EVENT, NASIR IS SAID TO BE “INTENSELY NATIONALISTIC AND SUSPICIOUS OF FOREIGNERS AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE HE WOULD IN PRACTICE BE READY TO GRANT MILITARY FACILITIES TO ANYONE SO LONG AS HE SEES ANY ALTERNATIVE COMMERCIAL FUTURE FOR GAN”.</p>
                        <p>4. NOTE EXPRESSES UNDERSTANDING OF U.S. CONCERN THAT UN- FRIENDLY POWER COULD MOVE INTO THE MALDIVES BUT SEES “VERY LITTLE CHANCE” THAT ANOTHER POWER “INIMICAL TO OUR INTERESTS” WILL REPLACE THE BRITISH. NOTE ARGUES THAT BEST CHANCE TO RETAIN INFLUENCE WITH GOM IS TO GO ALONG WITH TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. BRITISH THEREFORE INTEND TO REPLY TO <persName corresp="#p_NI1">NASIR</persName> THAT, WHILE RESERVING ON MALDIVIAN RATIONALE, <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> WILL CONCUR WITH TERMINATION. BRITISH, HOWEVER, WILL ALSO OFFER THREE MILLION POUNDS OF PROJECT AID OVER 3 TO 5 YEAR PERIOD, WITH NOTE HINTING STRONGLY THAT ADDU ATOLL (GAN) WILL RECEIVE PRIORITY.</p>
                        <p>5. SCOTT DID NOT ELABORATE ON NOTE, COPY OF WHICH BEING POUCHED TO COLOMBO AND LONDON. <persName corresp="#p_DA1">DUBS</persName> PROMISED A RESPONSE TO SCOTT AFTER DEPARTMENT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE MATTER FURTHER.</p>

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> AD HOC COMMITTEE ON INDIAN OCEAN CONCLUDED 1976 MEETINGS SEPT 17 WITH ADOPTION OF FINAL REPORT AND CONSENSUS APPROVAL OF DRAFT RESOLUTION (TEXT BELOW) TO BE SUBMITTED TO <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> FIRST COMMITTEE. DRAFT, LARGELY BASED ON SRI LANKAN WORKING PAPER, IS MODEST AND ESSENTIALLY PROCEDURAL. MOST NOTABLY, IT AVOIDS ANY MENTION OF DIEGO GARCIA, WHICH WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN NON-ALIGNED SUMMIT'S POLITICAL DECLARATION ON IOPZ. ALSO NOTABLE IS ITS RESTRAINED LANGUAGE CONCERNING A CONFERENCE OF INDIAN OCEAN STATES, CALLING SIMPLY FOR CONTINUED CONSULTATIONS ON A PROGRAM OF ACTION LEADING UP TO THE CONVENING OF SUCH A CONFERENCE.</p>

                        <p>2. ACCORDING TO AUSTRALIAN MISOFF WHO PARTICIPATED IN COMMITTEE MEETINGS, LOW-KEYED RESULTS REFLECT VIEWS OF MORE CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, IRAN, AND INDIA, WHICH OPPOSED “PRECIPITATE ACTION” ON CONFERENCE PROPOSAL OR EVEN ESTABLISHMENT OF TIME-FRAME FOR PREPARATORY WORK. SRI LANKA ALSO REPORTEDLY CONTINUED TO TAKE A BASICALLY MODERATE STAND, THOUGH FAVORING DEVELOPMENT OF A TIME-FRAME. RADICALS, ESPECIALLY IRAQ AND MADAGASCAR, WERE GENERALLY ABSENT FROM COMMITTEE MEETINGS. END LOU.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: I was in Zambia for the previous Non-Aligned Conference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: That's a nice place. I like Kaunda.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d100-03" facs="d100-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: I hope you can succeed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: There is a possibility. There is much jostling for power, but people are talking and I think we will wind up with a settlement in Rhodesia. Then we will have to decide what to do about Namibia. We have already gotten Nujoma, 85 percent of what he wants. The question is whether he will be satisfied with that or wait another ten years.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: But the South Africans won't talk with him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: No, but they will send someone to a conference in Geneva if it is convened and he will be made available for talks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: It is a matter of prestige for South Africa.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: The problem is that Vorster said he would not talk to a gang of murderers but if we can get them together in Geneva, six months later I assure you they will be talking. It shouldn't be difficult to find a way to get them together in Geneva if the South Africans make someone available while the others are there. The trouble is that some of the African leaders have no experience in politics. Instead of seeing where the trend is going, all they know how to do is to fight. They worry a great deal about their colleagues.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Is the question coming up in the Security Council?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">SCRANTON</hi>: Yes, it is on and there is talk there will be a meeting in October. Incidentally, Nujoma was enthusiastic about your speech. Secretary: Was he enthusiastic to the press?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">SCRANTON</hi>: I don't know.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: You have a great meeting with Africans and then they go out and say the opposite to the press. I had a great meeting with Nujoma.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Did you meet with Kaunda and Nyerere?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Yes, you saw them both. Didn't you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: Nyerere couldn't come to the summit.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: We have excellent relations with Kaunda. He is a 100 percent supporter of our efforts. Nyerere is concerned about his position with Mozambique. He supports us but uses anti-western rhetoric to protect his flank. I have no idea about Angola.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: Neto came to the summit. He seems all right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Is he as dynamic as Machel?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: No, not as dynamic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: I want to say how very impressed we were with your handling of the Non-aligned summit. It was a very difficult position and you did very well. Frankly, after your speech, I was going to write you a letter but then said let's wait. The Vietnamese were pretty moderate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: Yes, this was a striking feature. The Koreans were awful. Both sides. Maybe that's just the way they are.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: How do you define Non-aligned? How does Cuba get in? I have never understood that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: They were there from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: As the Prime Minister said this morning, the Non-aligned are not concerned about a country's internal system as long as the country is not tied up in an alliance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Without going into the mechanics of the Non-aligned, I thought that the Conference was managed in a very decent and fair way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: The Cubans were not very active.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Except for Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: It is hard to see sometimes how decisions are made at conferences. For example, our proposal for the UNCTAD meeting in Nairobi came up at a time when our supporters had gone to bed. Of the 150 countries participating, only 50 voted and we lost by 2 votes. The opposition were better organized at the meeting and we made some mistakes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: In the Non-aligned there are no votes, only a consensus.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Yes, but you have reservations. We appreciate Sri Lanka's reservations. <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Neville</persName> was good enough to come before the meeting. I told him where our boiling point was low.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Even on the Middle East, the resolution was not as extreme as at Lima.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: When is the next summit?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Havana three years from now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: When will the foreign ministers meet?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: Next year but I am not sure where.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: I told my friends in the Arab League meeting they would have me at their next meeting as an observer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: Did they agree?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: The Arabs are always extremely polite and they haven't said no. (Laughter)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: The situation in Lebanon is terrible. (Waiter brings in tea and sandwiches)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Do you prefer tea or coffee?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Actually, I lean more to tea. Previously <persName corresp="#p_KN2">Neville</persName> and other Ceylonese used to keep me supplied. Now that I am Secretary of State he doesn't. I had very good students from Sri Lanka. They gave me plenty of tea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: I have plenty of tea but I don't want to get into trouble by sending it to the Secretary. As the Prime Minister mentioned in her talk, our biggest problem comes from falling tea prices. That is why we want a commodity agreement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: What is your view on the Indian Ocean? I know about your proposal but how do you view developments in the region?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: At the present time India and Bangladesh are fighting about Farakka. It is on the agenda here. We have good relations with India and have settled our problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: You are the only neighbor who has.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: We are too small to do otherwise. We also have good relations with Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: They are our biggest tea buyer; since they lost their tea in East Pakistan, they have shifted to us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Bangladesh also produces tea?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: Maybe they will start buying some from Bangladesh now, but they have become accustomed to ours.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Bangladesh seems to be serious about the Farakka problem. Secretary: Do you have a solution? I would love to hear one.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: The irrigation group went to Delhi but nothing seemed to happen.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Bangladesh says it is prepared to call in third party assistance but India won't. It wants it handled bilaterally. Secretary: It is a political matter. India is trying to influence Bangladesh politics.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: But the Indians say they have been building the barrage for 15 years. They had an agreement with Mujib to use the barrage for one year and to see what the effect was. But the present regime in Bangladesh didn't agree. I spoke about this with Chavan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: I will see him next week. Their Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> is leaving.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Do you see the possibility of some settlement of the Korean question now that the item has been withdrawn from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agenda?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: If the North Koreans handle this like the German question, there could be a solution. Both countries could be recognized. But North Korea is trying to get bilateral talks started with us. They say these will be secret but then they will announce them publicly as soon as they start. We have maintained that we will talk with the South Koreans present or alone if the Russians or the Chinese were to talk with the South Koreans. We couldn't let North Korea isolate South Korea. We have no interest in a preferential U.S. position in Korea. If the North Koreans took a reasonable stand this would be a solvable problem. There is no demand in the U.S. to stay in Korea.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: I would like to thank you and your government for all the help you have given Sri Lanka, especially two years ago when we were trying to get an aid group to meet and the British were opposed to this. You were of help. We also appreciate your PL 480 assistance. As you know, we have had very bad weather in the last couple of years.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: The southwest monsoon failed and we had the worst drought since 1906. We have had to import drinking water pumps. The main problem has been that six rice crops failed in a row because of drought.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: Yes, the people are in very bad shape. It costs us a lot of foreign exchange. U.S. PL 480 assistance was very useful.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Mr. Secretary, I haven't had an opportunity to brief you yet, but we are hopeful of being able to provide additional PL 480 assistance for Sri Lanka. They have asked for an additional 100,000 tons of wheat flour.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: I want to assure you that our attitude will be to be helpful. Consider that you have an open invitation to Washington. You tell us when your schedule permits.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Prime Minister</hi>: One reason I was concerned about coming now was your election.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">SCRANTON</hi>: By all the books, after six bad years you have only one more to go, then you can expect seven good ones.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: As the Prime Minister said this morning, we have had to pay for the social progress we have made, the reduction in the population growth rate to 1.6 percent and the increase in our life expectancy to 67 years has cost us a lot of money. That is where the aid is very helpful.</p>

                        <p>1. AS REQUESTED IN PARA 3A OF REFTEL WE ARE PROVIDING THE FOLLOWING BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE U.S. COMMITMENT TO CENTO WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE HELPFUL TO YOU DURING DISCUSSIONS AT FUTURE CENTO POLITICAL WORKING GROUP MEETINGS. DURING SUCH MEETINGS U.S. REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE THE POSITION AS NOTED IN PARA 2 OF REFTEL THAT IN U.S. VIEW CENTO'S EXISTING POLICY DOCUMENTS ARE ADEQUATE.</p>

                        <p>2. THE U.S. ATTITUDE ON ITS CENTO COMMITMENT HAS BEEN CONSISTENT ;HROUGHOUT THE 17 YEARS OF OUR ASSOCIATION WITH THE ALLIANCE. WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS DEFINED OUR COMMITMENT IN A MANNER THAT:</p>
                        <p>A) PROHIBITS U.S. PARTICIPATION IN CENTO PLANNING AGAINST THREATS OTHER THAN THOSE THAT ARE COMMUNIST-INSPIRED, AND</p>
                        <p>B) MAKES CLEAR U.S. OPPOSITION TO CENTO INVOLVEMENT IN INTRA-AREA DISPUTES UNRELATED TO THE SINO-SOVIET THREAT, I.E., TO THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST AGGRESSION, BOTH ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL.</p>
                        <p>3. THESE THEMES RUN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT IN CENTO, AND THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THEY ARE BASED IS DOCUMENTED IN THE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS OF COOPERATION, SIGNED IN 1959 WITH EACH OF THE THREE REGIONAL MEMBERS. THE U.S. COMMITMENT UNDER ARTICLE I IN EACH OF THESE AGREEMENTS OBLIGATES US TO RENDER MILITARY ASSISTANCE ONLY AGAINST COMMUNIST AGGRESSION. ARTICLE I REFERS TO THE U.S. TAKING” N ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF THE U.S. SUCH APPROPRIATE ACTION, INCLUDING THE USE OF ARMED FORCES, AS MAY BE MUTUALLY AGREED UPON AND AS IS ENVISAGED IN THE JOINT RESOLUTION…” (NOTE: THE JOINT RESOLUTION TO PROMOTE PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST — JOINT RESOLUTION 117, MARCH 9, 1957 — THE EISENHOWER DOCTRINE.) THE JOINT RESOLUTION, IN TURN, STATES THAT THE U.S. “IS PREPARED TO USE ARMED FORCES TO ASSIST ANY NATION OR GROUP OF SUCH NATIONS (NATIONS OF THE MIDDLE EAST) REQUESTING ASSISTANCE AGAINST ARMED AGGRESSION FROM ANY COUNTRY CONTROLLED BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM…”</p>
                        <p>4. U.S. NEGOTIATORS AT THAT TIME (1959) WERE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS TO CONCLUDE EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS, NOT TREATIES, PURSUANT TO THE JOINT RESOLUTION OF 1957 AND THE MUTUAL SECURITY ACT OF 1954. OUR OBLIGATION TO RENDER ASSISTANCE WAS THEREBY LIMITED TO THOSE INSTANCES WHEN THE REGION FACED COMMUNIST AGGRESSION. THE NEW BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WERE THUS IN LINE WITH THE PROVISIONS AND INTENT OF THE JOINT RESOLUTION AND DRAFTED WITH CARE TO GUARD AGAINST THE U.S. TAKING ON ANY NEW AND EXPANDED OBLIGATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. (DEAN ACHESON IT SHOULD BE NOTED, IN 1957 CRITICIZED THE JOINT RESOLUTION, WHICH ENJOYED BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, FOR NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MORE IMPORTANT DANGER OF SUBVERSION.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <del rend="strikethrough">CONFIDENTIAL</del>

                        <p>PAGE 03 STATE 249640</p>
                        <p>5. THE AMERICAN NEGOTIATORS RESISTED ATTEMPTS BY IRAN TO HAVE THE U.S. UNDERTAKE A BROADER COMMITMENT, BUT THEY ALLOWED THE PREAMBLE OF THE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS TO CONTAIN THE PHRASE, “TO RESIST AGGRESSION, DIRECT OR INDIRECT” IN REFERRING TO THE BAGHDAD PACT'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE. IT MUST BE EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS OBLIGATION WAS NOT AND IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE SOMETHING NEW OR DIFFERENT. RATHER, IT HAS BEEN VIEWED AS SUPPLEMENTAL BOTH WITH RESPECT TO U.S.-CENTO RELATIONS AND TO U.S. RELATIONS WITH EACH OF THE THREE REGIONAL STATES CONCERNED.</p>
                        <p>6. THE HISTORY OF THE U.S. ASSOCIATION WITH CENTO, THEREFORE, INDICATES THAT, FROM THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO CIRCUMSCRIBE THE EXTENT OF OUR COMMITMENT UNDER THE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS. THIS HISTORY ALSO REVEALS A CONTINUING EFFORT BY IRAN AND PAKISTAN TO HAVE THIS COMMITMENT INCLUDE U.S. ASSISTANCE AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE REGIONAL ADVERSARIES. OVER THE YEARS THE U.S. HAS GONE TO SOME LENGTHS TO CONVINCE CONGRESS THAT OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS WERE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE JOINT RESOLUTION. IT IS MOST UNLIKELY, TO SAY THE LEAST, THAT CONGRESS WOULD BE ANY MORE RECEPTIVE NOW THAN IN YEARS PAST TO OUR UNDERTAKING A BROADER CENTO COMMITMENT.</p>
                        <p>7. GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OUTLINED ABOVE WE, NEVERTHELESS, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO BE REASONABLY RESPONSIVE TO REGIONAL COUNTRY EFFORTS TO UPDATE THE GUIDANCE USED FOR CENTO MILITARY EXERCISES LIKE ZANJEER.

                                <p>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY</p>
                                <p>There are now four roughly-differentiated categories of politically-involved Ceylon Tamils. They are divided by their approach to the future of the Tamil minority within (or without) the nation of Sri Lanka. On a rough continuum from the radicals to those satisfied with the status quo, they range as follows:
<list>

                                        <item>The independence fighters. The only formal organization of which we are aware is the Kela Viduthalai Por Eyakam (EVPE - translated variously as the Tamil Youth Revolutionary Front or the Ceylon Independence struggle Front). To this group is attributed responsibility for the assassination in July 1975 of Jaffna mayor Alfred Duraiyappah and the subsequent murder of at least one village-level government supporter in the Jaffna peninsula. (B) The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) MP's and other “gradualists”. Although now formally committed to a path leading to eventual independence from Sri Lanka, this group is in fact committed to the Parliamentary system and is not likely to encourage violence as a means to their goal unless there is a substantial change in the situation. They are currently planning election and post-election strategy.</item>
                                        <label>(C)</label>
                                        <item>Tamils seeking constitutional changes to provide for increased minority rights. One recently <pb n="2" xml:id="d102-02" facs="d102-02"/>organized group falling into this category is the “Tamil-speaking Peoples” Rights Movement,” an organization of moderate Tamils, some with government ties and others in opposition, seeking a specific list of 20 reforms.</item>
                                        <label>(D)</label>
                                        <item>“Tame” Government Tamils. These are those Tamils who support, or hold office in, the government, and, whatever their private feelings do not criticize the current minority policies.</item>
                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <p>While it is difficult to judge the comparative memberships and strengths of these factions, clearly the first has a prominence of proportion to its strength, because of its violent tactics.</p>
                                <p>With an election due sometime before September 1977, the major national parties are wooing Tamil support and some be expected to attempt to placate moderates among the Tamils. The 20-point program of the Tamil Rights movement is a convenient starting point for compromise in an effort to attract moderate Tamil support. The TULF is also being wooed by the national parties but the leadership has seen such pre-election moves before and will be very cautious.</p>

                                <p>THE INDEPENDENCE FIGHTERS</p>
                                <p>A relatively recent addition to the Sri Lanka political scene is an organized body of radical Tamils, dedicated to the liberation of the Tamil-dominated areas of Sri Lanka. Most of this group is youthful and many are unemployed-victims of either the educational “standardization” (district and language quotas for university admissions) which limits their opportunities for higher education, or of the government's' language policies, which limits their chances for employment in government service.</p>
                                <p>Although undoubtedly small, the group has made a name for itself through its violent activities, the most spectacular of which was the assassination in July 1975 of Jaffna mayor Alfred Duraiyappah, a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) supporter. Other attacks on government backers in the Jaffna area have followed, including the wounding of C. Arulampalam, District Political Authority and SLFP MP, and the fatal shooting of at least one village-level SLFP supporter. As intimidation, the tactics have worked. Arulampalam and the other SLFP MP in the Jaffna Peninsula, A. Thiagarajah, now severely limit their activities in their constituencies, preferring to remain instead in Colombo. The ultimate aim of the terror campaign, according to one source, is to make it impossible for any candidate unacceptable to the radicals to stand for election in the Tamil areas.</p>
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d102-03" facs="d102-03"/>
                                <p>The only formal organization of which the Embassy is aware in which these radicals are the controlling element is the Eela Viduthalai Por Eyakam (EVPE Ceylon Independence struggle Front or Tamil Youth Revolutionary Front). ([<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Secret-Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals not Releasable to Contractors or Contractor/Consultants.) They claim credit for the terrorist attacks described above. Whether or not there are other radical organizations among Tamil separatists in Sri Lanka is unknown. One of the most prominent among presumed members of the EVPE is A. Kandipan, wanted by the police for suspected involvement in the Duraiyappah assassination. He is the son of A. Amirthalingam, another radical and general secretary of the TULF. Kandipan was in school in India in 1975 and got to the United Kingdom on a forged Indian passport where he was reported as having sought political asylum. That request having been rejected, he is now fighting his deportation to India or Sri Lanka. (interestingly his flight to the U.K. on an Indian passport is taken by some officials here as an indication of at least passive Indian support for the Sri Lankan Tamil separatists.)</p>
                                <p>(In both the U.K. and. India, Kandipan was aided by overseas Tamil supporters of the separatist cause. Local Tamils are trying to organize an international network of such supporters but the only formal organization outside of Sri Lanka of which we are aware is the Eelan Tamil Association (ETA) based in London. The ETA (919 Garratt Lane, London, SW 17) issued separatist propaganda at the time of the Non-Aligned Conference and managed to induce several British MP's to call attention to the Tamil situation in Parliament.</p>
                                <p>In Sri Lanka, the radicals have been slowed down, but not stopped, by the arrest of around 20 of their activists, soon after the Duraiyappah assassination last year. Seven of the detainees (as well as two still at large) have finally been indicted for the murder and will come to trial before a High Court-at-bar, now scheduled to convene November 29, but liable to postponement depending on the outcome of the current Supreme Court appeal of the voiding of the Emergency Regulations under which trials-at-bar were authorized.</p>

                                <p>Tamil United Liberation Front “Gradualists”</p>
                                <p>Formerly the Tamil United Front, now renamed the Tamil United Liberation Front, and supposedly considering a further name change to the Tamil Liberation Organization, the organization has formally changed its stated goal from seeking autonomy for the north and east in a federal Sri Lanka to advocacy of an eventually independent nation in the Tamil area. With its nucleus in the Federal Party headed by S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, the TULF also includes the old <pb n="4" xml:id="d102-04" facs="d102-04"/>Tamil Congress, whose primary strength is its long-time leader G.G. Ponnambalam, and the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), the chief political organization of the one million Indian Tamil plantation workers. The CWC however, without withdrawing from the TULF, has unequivocally detached itself from the demand for a separate state.</p>
                                <p>The commitment of the other members of the TULF to an eventual Tamil nation can also be seriously questioned. Some no doubt see their demands as an extreme bargaining ploy with which they can try to extract an autonomous northern region or at least recognition of Tamil as a national language equivalent to Sinhala. Others might like to see a separate state but are not willing to resort to open warfare with the Sinhalese. With a few notable exceptions (specifically A. Amirthalingam), the leadership of the TULF is relatively moderate and willing to propagandize in favor of an independent nation but will probably confine itself to non-violence in the near future.</p>
                                <p>Publicly the TULF has declared itself uninterested in the current debate over whether or not there will be elections as scheduled next year. Ike leaders' stated rationale is that they are interested only in the independence of their region and not what happens in the south, where both Sinhala-dominated parties will continue to discriminate against them. In fact, though from a pragmatic point of view, an election could offer opportunities to barter their political support for concessions on issues important to the Tamil community. Opposition leader J. R. Jayewardene as well as Minister of Trade <persName corresp="#p_ITB1">T.B. Ilangaratne</persName> from the SLFP have met in recent months with TULF leader S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, in hopes of evolving some sort of “dialogue” with the Tamils. Chelvanayakam is still at least publicly proclaiming disinterest in deals with other parties, short of meeting the TULF's demand for a separate state. He also knows that his party will almost inevitably pick up some seats in a new election, possibly five or more to add to their present eleven.

                                <p>Moderates</p>
                                <p>Most Ceylon Tamils probably fall into the category of moderates. They would agree that they have serious grievances but see themselves as citizens of a united Sri Lanka, rather than a Jaffna-centered mini-state. These moderates are split among the island's many political organizations.</p>
                                <p>The United National Party (UNP), born in the days before independence when conflicts between the interests of the Sinhala and Tamil communities were not so apparent, has always had a substantial amount of Tamil support, especially in the Colombo area. The UNP <pb n="5" xml:id="d102-05" facs="d102-05"/>has been the one “national” party which has been able to win seats in Tamil-majority areas. The left parties too - the Lanka Sara Samaja Party (LSSP) and the Communist Party/Moscow wing (CP/M) have always had a following among Tamils, including those in the Jaffna peninsula, stronghold of the TULF. Whatever their brand of Marxism, most LSSP and CP/M members in Jaffna have shared the belief that the future of the Tamil community of Ceylon lies in cooperation with the Sinhala majority. Apart from these mainline Marxist parties, N. Shanmugathasan, head of the small Ceylon Communist Party/Peking wing, and Bala Tampoe, General Secretary of the Ceylon Mercantile Union and head of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Revolutionary), are two prominent radical Tamils who see their future in national, not regional, politics.</p>
                                <p>A new organization, formed in June 1976, has as its aim negotiations with the government to redress a long list of grievances now felt by the Tamil minority. Called the Tamil-speaking Peoples' Rights Movement, the loose coalition, with a nucleus of 40 organizers, was condemned by some as a put-up job by the government to allow the Prime Minister to negotiate with a non-aggressive group and assure a Non—Aligned Conference in August uninterrupted by dissident Tamils. In fact, there are some SLFP and CP/M supporters on the list of petitioners and in fact the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> did ostentatiously meet with representatives of the group on the eve of the Non-aligned Conference.</p>
                                <p>However, most observers agree that the group is relatively independent and sincerely seeks some kind of compromise between the two currently-polarized positions. The signators to the original resolution (attached as an appendix to this airgram) include representatives of all major parties including a few loosely attached to the TULF. They are respected as leaders of moderate Tamil opinion and include in their number several Tamil-speaking Moslems as well.</p>
                                <p>Their twenty-point program calls mostly for legislative redress of discrimination against the Tamil. A formal recognition of Tamil as a national language (along with Sinhala) and as the language of administration in the Northern and Eastern Provinces is their primary goal and most of the twenty points deal with the various hardships alleged to be suffered by Tamil Speakers.</p>
                                <p>The TULF pointedly refrains from criticizing the Tamil Rights Movement and in private some Front members will make the point that they are all working toward the same general goals but that the TULF does not believe that the methods of the Tamil Rights Movement will be successful.</p>
                                <p>The Prime Minister has met twice with representatives of this group, in talks described as “friendly and cordial,” and has said the government is considering the proposals that were made. Obviously <pb n="6" xml:id="d102-06" facs="d102-06"/>the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> finds this a more congenial group with which to negotiate than the Tamil United Liberation Front. Equally obviously, though, the Tamil-speaking Peoples' Rights Movement speaks only for itself and cannot automatically deliver any substantial segment of the Tamil vote to the ruling party. However, concessions along the lines the Movement has laid out might have the effect of turning more moderate Tamils away from the increasingly radical TULF; this is obviously just what the Prime Minister has in mind.</p>

                                <p>“Tame” (Government) Tamils</p>
                                <p>This is the head-in-the-sand variety of Tamil politician who considers his personal position within the government to be more important than challenging the status quo. These Tamils are not very influential within their community and generally are not elected officials. They are the prime targets of the would-be terrorists among the radical youth. Former Jaffna mayor Alfred Duraiyappah, assassinated in July 1975, was an archetype. Post and Telecommunications Minister C. Kumarasisar (an appointed Member of Parliament), C. Arulampalam, Political Authority for Jaffna District (elected to Parliament in 1970 as a member of the Tamil Congress, he later switched to the SLFP), and A. Thiagarajah (like Arulampalam, he was a Tamil Congressman who defected to the SLFP) are three other prominent members of the non-critical school of Tamil opinion. Thiagarajah ah was recently quoted in the press as calling for a new “Tamil Socialist Party” but what he apparently had in mind was a formal Tamil faction within the STP, similar to the present Islamic Socialist Front, loyal to the ruling party.</p>
                                <p>All of this variety are now somewhat shy of spending much time in the Jaffna peninsula, where they feel threatened by gun—wielding radicals, and they cannot realistically expect to serve in the new National State Assembly to be elected in 1977 (in which, under the new constitution, there will be no appointed members).</p>

                                <p>Conclusion</p>
                                <p>It is important to note that, with the exception of the radical fringe, most Tamil politicians in Sri Lanka are more interested in the upcoming elections than in independence and a separate state. It bodes well for the future of a unified Sri Lanka that the great majority of Tamils, despite their grievances against a Sinhalese-dominated government, appears committed now to cooperation, rather than conflict with the majority community.</p>
                                <p>Nevertheless the Sri Lanka government is left with two major problems involving the Tamils. The first is that the separatist movement has every potential for growth. The radicals are primarily <pb n="7" xml:id="d102-07" facs="d102-07"/>the youth, who have been hit hardest by the quotas in education and the linguistic barriers to employment. This group of unemployed and alienated Tamils will grow, not shrink, if, as appears likely, the quotas remain in one from or another and the national economy continues to stagnate.</p>
                                <p>The second problem is one faced by any established government when confronted with a fanatical minority, which the separatist Tamils decidedly are. Such a minority, when violently inclined, can cause far more trouble than their numbers would indicated. It appears that some Tamil radicals are embarked on such a terrorist course aimed now only at Tamils who are seen as government “collaborators” but with the potential for expansion into more generalized violence.</p>
                                <p>A general election, expected in 1977, may alter the temporary position of the forces. The Tamil moderates may win some concessions and it is even conceivable that the Federal Party Tamil United Liberation Front could participate in the government as it did after 1965. But whether any concessions now foreseeable could substantially change the long-term outlook is doubtful. Both the adamancy of the Sinhalese on the language issue and the poor economic and employment prospects will contribute to continued ill-feeling between the two communities and may lead to a gradual shifting of Tamil opinion toward the more extreme solution of separatism for their problems.</p>

                                <p>SUMMARY: ASSUMING OFFICE IN WAKE OF DISASTROUS DECEMBER 1971 WAR, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> ADMINISTRATION HAS MOVED ENERGETICALLY TO RESTORE AND REDIRECT PAKISTAN 'S SHATTERED FOREIGN POLICY. PRIMARY EFFORT HAS BEEN AIMED AT OVERCOMING EFFECTS OF WAR AND SEEKING NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA TO REPLACE QUARTER CENTURY OF CONFRONTATION. EFFORT HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY HISTORICAL ATMOSPHERE OF SUSPICION AND DISTRUST, BUT NEGOTIATIONS HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS OVER PAST YEAR AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO, ALTHOUGH AT DELIBERATE PACE. ATTEMPT TO WORK OUT RELATIONSHIP WITH BANGLADESH, ON OTHER HAND, HAS BEEN FRUITLESS <pb n="2" xml:id="d103-02" facs="d103-02"/>TO DATE. IMPASSE WITH BDG OVER INTERLOCKING PROBLEMS OF RECOGNITION, WAR CRIMES TRIALS, AND RETURN OF POW'S REMAINS UNBROKEN. RENEWED MOVES TO TACKLE ISSUE CAN BE EXPECTED AFTER MARCH BANGLADESH ELECTIONS, HOWEVER. LOOKING BEYOND SUBCONTINENT, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> GOVERNMENT SEES CHINA AS CLOSEST FRIEND AND SUPPORTER, WITH CHINESE INFLUENCE VISIBLE IN VARIOUS <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> POLICY DECISIONS. PAK ATTITUDE TOWARD SOVIET UNION IS AMBIVALENT, WITH <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> INTERESTED IN IMPROVING RATHER COOL RELATIONS BUT INDICATING A CONSIDERABLE CONCERN OVER SOVIET INTENTIONS TOWARD SOUTH ASIA — ESPECIALLY TOWARD SENSITIVE PAKISTANI PROVINCES OF BALUCHISTAN AND NORTH WEST FRONTIER. BHUTTO GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ACTIVE INTEREST IN PAK CONTACTS WTTH OTHER COUNTRIES OF THIRD WORLD, PARTICULARLY ARAB AND MIDDLE EAST STATES, AND HAS MAINTAINED EXISTING LINKS (INCLUDING CENTO) WITH IRAN AND TURKEY. RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN, CLOUDED BY <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> SUSPICION OF UK PARTIALITY TO INDIA, ARE COOL. RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORING AFGHANISTAN REASONABLY AMICABLE BUT PERIODICALLY PLAGUED BY LATTER'S ESPOUSAL OF PUSHTUNISIAN ISSUE. US CONSIDERED BY BHUTTO GOVERNMENT AS FRIEND SECOND ONLY OF CHINESE. BHUTTO HAS EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR US SUPPORT IN 1971 AND FOR US ECONOMIC AID. AT SAME TIME, <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> NOT INHIBITED FROM TAKING POSITIONS ON ISSUES AT VARIANCE WITH THOSE OF US, ALTHOUGH RARELY WITHOUT ADVANCE CONSULTATION. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> GOVERNMENT'S PRESENT POLICY GOALS APPEAR TO INCLUDE ACCOMMODATION TO NEW “REALITIES” ALTHOUGH NOT AT COST OF ACCEPTING INDIAN HEGEMONY; MAINTAINING CLOSE TIES WITH CHINA AND US; AND IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH SOVIET UNION TO EXTENT POSSIBLE. BEYOND THAT, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S FOREIGN POLICY CAN BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN ACTIVE IN PROPAGATING “INDEPENDENCE” OF PAK POSITION, IN SEEKING RESTORE PAKISTAN 'S SHATTERED IMAGE ABROAD, AND OF WINNING AS MANY FRIENDS AS POSSIBLE.</p>

IN <pb n="9" xml:id="d103-09" facs="d103-09"/>PARTICULAR, PAKS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER ALLEGED SOVIET MEDDLING IN NORTH WEST FRONTIER AND ESPECIALLY BALUCHISTAN, PROVINCES WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES CONTROL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS WIDELY EXPRESSED SUSPICION OF SOVIETS HAS VARIOUS FACETS: THERE IS UNDOUBTED ELEMENT OF GENUINE GOP FEAR OF WHAT RUSSIANS MAY BE UP TO IN THIS AREA. BEYOND THIS, HOWEVER, GOP APPEARS TO SOME EXTENT TO BE DELIBERATELY PLAYING UP “SOVIET THREAT” AS MEANS ATTRACTING GREATER SUPPORT FROM US AND CHINA. BHUTTO REGIME ALSO NO ADVERSE TO BANDYING CHARGES OF SUBSERVIENCE TO FOREIGN INTERESTS AS MEANS UNDERMINING DOMESTIC POLITICAL OPPOSITION IN FRONTIER AND BALUCHISTAN.</item>

                            </hi>: I am glad we finally have this chance to review our relations. In fact our relations have improved since we started these discussions. Let's have a general talk today and then a more specific conversation in a couple of weeks.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry you are leaving. I really am. You were here during a difficult period and conducted yourself … Unfortunately! … with great skill, and great dignity. During the crisis you handled the press better than I did!</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi>: Where do we go from here?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I think the evolution that has now started will have its own momentum. Don't you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Within the next month something will be done on this $87 million.</p>
                        <p>Have you had a preliminary discussion with Williams on how to conceive this?</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d104-02" facs="d104-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi>: He had some ideas. We had a quite workable arrangement on the economic aid. He went on to discuss phase II on military supplies, some to Pakistan and some to us. That I told him would be difficult for us to say yes to.</p>
                        <p>But on the economic and cultural side, it was okay. A linkage of any kind between the economic and military side would be impossible. It would create more problems. But the economic package he was putting together was okay.</p>
                        <p>On the military side, the question is not so much what you are supplying and where, but what is your view of the subcontinent on which you are supplying these arms. In other words, what does it mean? Let me put it this way: While publicly we both say we are bound to be friendly, there is no basis to think that democracies can be more friendly to each other than others.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We have proved that!</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi>: Right. So the question is, what is the kind of view you have that would be the real basis of building better relations? The fact that there is no area of conflict between us is helpful. But this is negative. I thought you as a philosopher could tell me!</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Chou En-Lai said of me that I am the only one who can talk for a half-hour without saying anything.</p>
                        <p>The restraint you showed during the period of the bombing, we very much appreciate.</p>
                        <p>The immediate irritant, military supply to Pakistan : There are three categories of issues. First, Pakistan equipment that was caught here in the pipeline, which we have no right to keep. This is a matter of title. This is a million dollars worth. Second, contracts unfulfilled, about another $13 million. Three, the onetime exception, which is $40 million. And four, equipment beyond that. I can tell you there is no intent to establish a continuing military supply relationship with Pakistan. On the other hand, we must certainly release what belongs to them — the one million. So the question is, what do we do in relation to categories 2 and 3?</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d104-03" facs="d104-03"/>
                        <p>You know that even all of it would not affect the strategic situation one iota. There is no intention of engaging or encouraging an arms race.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the first two categories, when we clear those up, we could do the same for India. I am not committing us to it, I am just thinking out loud.</p>
                        <p>But this is the kind of military thing that could happen. You will not be confronted with American pressure taking the form of a continuing military supply program to Pakistan .</p>
                        <p>On the general thing, you know I think the events of last year, while painful, had a salutary effect. They eliminated some immature emotions. We had always treated you with a mixture of narcissism — seeing things in you that flattered ourselves. The noble savage. I am being very candid. Then you acted like a great power; you got in our way and we had to oppose you.</p>
                        <p>But now we can deal in a mature way with each other. We recognize you as a major power in South Asia — from Indochina to the Middle East. Therefore, your concerns have to be taken seriously by us. And your concerns and interests are rather parallel to ours. We do not want any outside power to dominate South Asia. So I think we can deal on the basis of genuine reciprocity.</p>
                        <p>We should exchange, as we do with a very few others, general perceptions of where we stand. We should discuss our major moves in advance so that neither of us is taken by surprise.</p>
                        <p>So we look upon you as a major element of order and stability in the area. This does not preclude having good relations with any other country. But you should not be an extension of any other country either. Again that is in your interest as much as ours.</p>

                            </hi>: With respect to Bangladesh our interests are like yours, that is, in the stability of the country. We do not want a communist Bangladesh, nor do you.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And it would have a catastrophic effect on West Bengal.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Nor do we want economic dislocation there. What do you refer to? Do you mean their military supply policy toward Pakistan ?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>: Chinese influence is very far forward.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Are they trying to do that?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>: They are trying to test their strength in the Bangladesh elections in March.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Chinese have no veto over our policy. Whatever community of interest exists between China and the United States, it extends to South Asia only to the extent that South Asia should not become an extension of one superpower.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>: The Chinese believe that India is an extension of the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We do not believe that.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>: Can the Chinese be disillusioned about that?</p>

                            </hi>: That we are prepared to do. As our own assessment, not as a message from you.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes. What role do you see for India in Indochina?</p>
                        <p>Oh, first, one more thing about arms supplies. I would accept — but many in my government would not — that the arms you supply to Pakistan will not affect the strategic situation. But the thing which would be of concern to my mind, is that it implies a certain political support to Pakistan, at a time when Pakistan is still in a negative phase, trying to create tensions, rather than build bridges. I mean, if the Simla Agreement had been carried through — that is, recognition of Bangladesh — none of this would have happened.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Is that what is holding it up? Bangladesh recognition?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes. The prisoners are not really a problem. We have no interest in them. The problem is only because it is a slap in the face of Mujib — he would lose face. They are trying to drive a wedge between us and Bangladesh. If Pakistan would do something, it would be quickly worked out. Instead, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has launched a press campaign, to which we are not responding.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: I have the impression that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is willing to recognize Bangladesh but his domestic opinion is a problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi>: He is a clever man. When he whips up public opinion one way or the other, he can get support. If he wanted to grant recognition, he has not insuperable difficulty.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi>: It is what worries us. He is trying to get something more out of India, and playing the domestic game. This is a different course from what he showed at Simla.</p>
                        <p>He is telling your Senators that he wants American arms as a sign of a political commitment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: A commitment to what? We have a certain commitment to the independence of Pakistan .</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi>: What concerns us is that he is blocking a political settlement — for which we would make concessions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: About the military supplies, you know the background. You know about the one-time exception. The President felt he had a moral obligation.</p>
                        <p>For us, it is important to separate essentially subsidiary problems from the basic ones. I don't know what political support is implied in keeping old commitments. I have given you the worse situation that could happen.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Pakistan 's position, we are not encouraging Pakistani intransigence on Bangladesh recognition. We have no interest in it. We have not pushed Pakistan on it, and we can express our view. We in fact have not had a consistent dialogue with Pakistan on any subject in recent months.</p>
                        <p>I understand your point. But there is something to be said for lancing the boil and getting it over with. We are in favor of the prisoner of war releases and are against the use of force against Pakistan. But this is not a prospect.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We think you can play a useful role in Laos and Cambodia in the ICC. In Cambodia, your interests and our interests are congruent. We are not in favor of seeing Peking dominate Phnom Penh, because we <pb n="7" xml:id="d104-07" facs="d104-07"/>don't want any great power to dominate Phnom Penh. Therefore, if some accommodations could be reached between Lon Nol and the Khmer communists, with the North Vietnamese already agreed to withdraw, we could get a neutral Cambodia in which no great power exercises a dominate influence. If we could get that Commission reconstituted, we think it could be useful. We are doing the same in Laos. It is easier in Laos to get a political arrangement; which could make it easier to get the ICC back.</p>
                        <p>With respect to South Vietnam, if the agreement is maintained there may be enough tranquility to perhaps get a political accommodation.</p>

                            </hi>: We will use our maximum influence to see that it is complied with. Most violations are on the communist side. It is too early to tell.</p>

                            </hi>: I think geographic proximity counts. Therefore, the Chinese in the long run. I don't see why Russia would want to invest great resources or prestige.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>

So my channel is a bit dislocated because Haksar is not <pb n="9" xml:id="d104-09" facs="d104-09"/>there, so I have no feedback on what happened between the Prime Minister and Souvanna. What the Foreign Office tells me, I am not sure of. I don't want to mislead you.

The other fellow is someone who was in our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation once, and is now dealing with Kashmir. It depends totally on the Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_DDP2">Dhar</persName> is a very sensible guy. On foreign policy issues, he has been detached from the rigmarole of the Foreign Office.

                        <p>THE SECRETARY OF STATE</p>
                        <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                        <p>We have undertaken a fundamental reassessment of our interests and policies in South Asia. Our detailed analysis of interests and policy options and scenario setting forth a proposed strategy for South Asia are attached. Our study suggests that we can maintain a reasonable basis for satisfactory relations with Pakistan, continue to help Bangladesh in its quest for stability, and seek a sounder basis for mutually beneficial relations with India. While this memorandum touches on other aspects of our policy in South Asia, its principal focus is on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>'s mission in India.</p>
                        <p>Our major objective in South Asia is regional stability: a situation in which the nations of the area can live peacefully with each other and enjoy good and balanced relations with major external powers. In a global context we seek a peaceful system in South Asia in which the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China can pursue legitimate interests in satisfactory relations with all South Asian powers in a manner which reinforces respect for peaceful and orderly cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Important changes have taken place in South Asia which provide us with the opportunity to pursue these objectives. India and Pakistan are engaged in tackling their problems through negotiation and the prospects for regional stability have improved. Our relations with Pakistan are good, reflecting in large part that our economic assistance has totaled more than $210 million since the end of the war. Nevertheless, Pakistan is troubled by our continued silence on the military supply issue. While there are occasional frictions <pb n="2" xml:id="d105-02" facs="d105-02"/>in our bilateral relations with Bangladesh, there is a reasonable basis for satisfactory U.S. ties with that new country. With regard to India, recent developments have improved the prospects for sounder U.S.-India relations based on respect for each other's interests. India is making a deliberate effort to improve its ties with the U.S. It has ended the controversy about <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> activities. It has limited official criticism of U.S. policy in Vietnam. It has lifted some of the restrictions on U.S. operations in India. It has publicly and privately expressed its interest in better relations. India is undoubtedly seeking such improvement in order to attain some degree of balance for its ties with the Soviet Union and to open up the option of obtaining economic resources from the U.S. More important to India, however, is attaining U.S. acceptance of present power relationships in South Asia.</p>
                        <p>We believe we should take advantage of present opportunities to put our relations with the South Asian countries on a stronger basis. For this purpose, we have developed a series of recommendations which are set forth in detail in two additional attachments to this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The first of these attachments contains recommendations pertaining to military shipments. When President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s special representative comes to the U.S. in March, we believe we should inform him that we have lifted export restrictions on the million dollars worth of spares and non-lethal military items belonging to Pakistan which have not been shipped because of our arms embargo. We may be able to limit the Indian reaction to this if we first give time for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> to lay the groundwork in New Delhi in his initial talks in late February.</p>
                        <p>The second attachment provides recommended talking points for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>'s initial discussions in New Delhi. At the outset we believe Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> should be authorized to clear up some of the impediments to U.S.-India relations caused by the war in the expectation that India will continue to clear up the restrictions it has imposed. On the U.S. side this would consist largely of advising the Indians that we are lifting the suspension of $87.6 million in commodity aid; on the Indian side, it would for the most part comprise continued Indian movement in lifting the limitations on our use of our rupee balances.</p>
                        <p>Next, we believe the Ambassador should begin serious talks with the Indians on the direction in which our political <pb n="3" xml:id="d105-03" facs="d105-03"/>and economic relations should go during the next three to four years. On the political side he should set forth views on South Asia which are consistent with the stance we have taken since the end of the war:
<list>
                                <item>— we share with the South Asian countries an interest in stability and peaceful cooperation;</item>
                                <item>— under the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine we wish to be helpful but do not intend to intervene;</item>
                                <item>— we recognize that major changes have taken place in South Asia, changes which need not adversely affect U.S. interests;</item>
                                <item>— we support the India-Pakistan negotiations and do not intend to take actions which would alter in any significant way the ratio of military power among the nations of South Asia;</item>
                                <item>— we are concerned about the problem of prisoners of war;</item>
                                <item>— we wish to maintain satisfactory relations with all South Asian countries.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the context of this exposition of our view of South Asia, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> should inform the Indians of our decision to permit shipment of the military items owned by Pakistan but held up by the embargo. He should also alert them to our consideration of an arms policy which would permit cash sales of spares and non-lethal end-items to Pakistan and India. Finally, he should assure the Indians that we will be able to issue export licenses for the $18 million Peace Indigo radar communications project by June 30, 1973.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador should also reiterate the importance we attach to developments in Southeast Asia and reaffirm our desire that India, in its statements and policies, take into account our interests there.</p>
                        <p>On the economic side, the Ambassador should indicate our willingness to examine the entire spectrum of U.S.-Indian economic relations. Our objective should be to seek a way of clearing away present problems, such as that caused by our accumulation of very large balances of Indian rupees and to examine how we might evolve a more satisfactory economic relationship which takes into account U.S. as well as Indian interests. In particular he should offer to examine with the <pb n="4" xml:id="d105-04" facs="d105-04"/>Indians how we can work together, including within the consortium context, toward the Indian development objective of reducing net aid to zero as of the end of the decade. He should also open discussions of how our trade and investment relationships can be made more mutually beneficial.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you approve these proposals in regard to military shipments and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>'s initial talks in New Delhi.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And in fact if we keep our tough line, Mr. President, if we [unclear] two years [unclear].</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>: I've got two crises now. First, they had been asked—They have made the ridiculous assertion that they want to get rid of all foreign aid by the year 1979. Well, Ion my instructions, say, oh go in to them and say, “Ok, fine. What do you say we work it out, phasing down our aid operations so that it doesn't come as a sudden lurch, you know.” Let them in the end they'll have to come to us and say, “Look, as a matter of fact we can't"—that they can't. I mean—</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Are they?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>: [unclear] this month [unclear] they expect a 6% bond exchange in Chicago in December, buying wheat at twice the price the Russians buy, and not say a word to us. They may have to spend another third of their foreign exchange before June. [Unclear] They're simply that broke and there's only one place in the world to buy wheat, and that's here. And we haven't got any surplus wheat that we can get rid of, plus we have no place to put it in the market.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>: Any wheat we give them is dollar wheat we could sell to get—we could sell it to China, sell it to Russia with no problems. Now, but Earl Butz is being very decent about this. He says, “Look…”</p>
                        <p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>: “…we will"—At least that he wants early returns from us, and if it looks like they're going to need a lot of wheat next year they can work out a gentlemen's agreement with the Russians not to take so much that there's nothing left. The price reduction goes to hell here, and there's nothing left for the Indians and then we have to pay really much more. And he mentioned it to them. If we have to come to help them then, well then a decision is going to have to be made. That ain't good. [Unclear] if we didn't think about it, but there's no more surplus wheat to give them.</p>

                        <p>PAKISTAN: THE IRAQI ARMS CAPER AND THE LARGER PICTURE</p>
                        <p>The dramatic discovery of a cache of Soviet-made arms in the Iraqi Embassy in Islamabad on February 10 defies explanation in terms of either Iraqi or Soviet intentions. The real significance of the incident appears to lie in the impact it will have on Pakistan's domestic and international politics; indeed, for <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, the nature and timing of the incident made it nothing short of a windfall.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Unanswered Questions</hi>. Iraq 's motives in the affair will probably remain obscure. The Iraqi Baath is a meddlesome regime, and there is a fairly extensive history of Iraqi complicity in the smuggling of arms to subversive elements in neighboring states, including Oman, Bahrain, and Iran. Presumably the arms found by the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> were intended for Baluchi tribes in Iran or, conceivably, in Pakistan. However, the suitability of Islamabad as a transfer point for hot cargo to any point in distant Baluchistan is highly questionable — as the recent discovery demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Little Likelihood of Soviet Involvement</hi>. Although both Tehran and Islamabad have alleged that Moscow is supporting separatist movements in Iran and Pakistan, there is no evidence to support these charges; on the contrary, the Soviet Union has on occasion attempted to restrain Iraq 's activities against Iran .</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d107-02" facs="d107-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> Scores</hi>. What is clear, however, is that the Government of Pakistan carefully stage-managed the incident for maximum effect. Obviously having had detailed advance information on the Iraqi arms shipments, Islamabad allowed them to clear customs at Karachi and accumulate in Islamabad until it was ready to stage the sensational discovery in which newsmen and TV crews participated. The government immediately released a detailed statement, apparently prepared in advance, which reached its embassies abroad the same day. The statement implicated no Pakistani by name, and <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> himself did not then make any public comment on the incident. However, government officials and government-guided media have unanimously and vociferously interpreted it as prima facie evidence of a Soviet plot to promote rebellion by the National Awami Party (NAP), and thus destroy the unity of Pakistan .</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Targets — At Home</hi>… Although NAP leader WALI KHAN has recently made a series of conciliatory statements, disavowing separatism and denying any intention to oppose <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s draft constitution in the Assembly next month, he remains the most immediate threat to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s dominance through strong central government. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> had been inhibited from overt moves against Wali or the NAP by fear of an uprising in the Northwest Frontier Province and Baluchistan, the two provinces where the tribal-supported NAP is politically dominant. Now, his hand strengthened by the Iraqi arms seizure, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has begun a clamp-down on the NAP: On February 13, NAP leaders in Punjab were placed under house arrest, and on February 15 <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> dismissed the NAP Governors of Baluchistan and <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> and proclaimed President's rule in Baluchistan.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d107-03" facs="d107-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">…and Abroad</hi>. The incident was even more ideally suited to support Pakistan 's upcoming approach to the US for military and economic support. Authoritative Pakistani spokesmen have charged not only that the 1971 defeat by India took place at Soviet instigation, but also that the Soviets responded to the Sino-US detente by undertaking to destroy the ally which helped make that detente a reality. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> sees Pakistan as a partner in a new Asian alliance against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> , and he maintains that Pakistan is directly threatened by the Soviet Union as a result of this relationship.</p>
                        <p>Recently, Pakistani officials have been complaining that the US fails to appreciate the magnitude of the Soviet threat to US interests in South Asia. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has asked the US to review its interests in the area and to fashion a new relationship with Pakistan on the basis of its conclusions. Now, more than ever, he considers that Pakistan must reach a new security relationship with the US. When Governor <persName>Khan</persName> (and possibly <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>) visit Washington next month,</p>
                        <p>Pakistan can cite the Iraqi arms offenses as “proof” of their view of Soviet intentions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Uncanny Coincidence</hi>. Whatever the facts of the incident, it has been a political windfall for <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, affording him ammunition against domestic opposition and supporting his key foreign policy objective. So well does the Iraqi arms incident serve <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s purposes that the possibility of Pakistan 's provocation in the affair cannot be excluded. As Afghan Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SMM2">Shafiq</persName> observed, the incident appears “too pat to fit.”</p>

ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL TIKKA KHAN STATED FEBRUARY 15 FOLLOWING QUICK VISIT TO LASBELA THAT ONLY 8 TO 10 PERSONS HAD DIED IN DISTURBANCES.) UNDER INTERIM CONSTITUTION PRESIDENT CAN ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL UNDER ARTICLE 14 OVER PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT IF PRESIDENT “IS SATISFIED THAT A SITUATION HAS ARISEN IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF A PROVINCE CANNOT BE CARRIED ON IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION.”) ARTICLE 136 REGARDING DISTRIBUTION PROVINCES AND FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE RIGHTS WAS CITED IN PROCLAMATION RATHER THAT ARTICLE 134, PROBABLY ERRONEOUSLY, SUGGESTING THAT PROCLAMATION WAS DRAWN UP HURRIEDLY.</item>

GOOD CASE CAN BE MADE (IN ABSTRACT) THAT USSR SOMEHOW INVOLVED, BUT THIS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. EVEN PAKISTANIS, WHO PRONE TO BELIEVE IRAQIS WERE ACTING FOR SOVS TO HARM PAKISTAN, ADMIT THEIR LACK OF PROOF. ARMS INCIDENT NEVERTHELESS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH PAKISTAN DOMESTIC AND REGIONAL FOREIGN RELATIONS, AND WILL THUS CONTINUE TO MERIT SPECULATION AND SCRUTINY. END SUMMARY</item>

                            <item>SINCE MY RETURN FROM CONSULTATIONS LAST WEEKEND, I HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO GET FURTHER INFORMATION AND/OR INSIGHT REGARDING PAK HAUL OF SOVIET WEAPONS AT IRAQI CHANCERY HERE FEB 10. TO THIS END I HAVE SOUGHT OUT VARIETY OF GOP OFFICIALS AND DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR VIEWS. REPORTS OF MY TALKS WITH MID-EAST DIRGEN OF MFA, DIRECTOR OF PAK INTELLIGENCE BUREAU, AND SOV AMB HAVE ALREADY BEEN SENT. OTHERS WITH WHOM I HAVE DISCUSSED ARMS MATTER AT SOME LENGTH INCLUDE BRITSH, FRENCH, SAUDI AND SYRIAN AMBS AND IRANIAN CHARGE, AND GOP INFORMATION SECRETARY. OUR ARMA HAS SEEN AND REPORTED ON HIS MEETINGS THIS WEEK WITH DIRECTOR OF PAK INTERSERVICES INTELLIGENCE AND DIRECTOR OF (ARMY) MILITARY INTELIGENCE. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN STUDYING A COUPLE OF RECENT PUBLICE STATEMENTS BY PRES. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> REFERRING TO THE ARMS INCIDENT AND EXTENSIVE PRESS COMMENTARY. THE FOLLOWING IS WHERE I COME OUT AT THIS MOMENT.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>THE FACT THAT SEVERAL HUNDRED SUB-MACHINE GUNS OF SOVIET MAKE, AND SOME OTHER SMALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION, WERE FOUND IN IRAQI EMBASSY HERE IS NOT DISPUTED BY ANYONE. THAT FACT ITSELF HAS SOME IMPORTANCE—PERHAPS MAJOR—-FOR PAKISTAN 'S DOMESTIC SITUATION AND ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS. BUT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE NOT YET CLEAR IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME MORE PRECISE INFORMATION ON THE ARMS OPERATION. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR JUST WHOM WERE THE ARMS INTENDED, WHAT WAS THEIR INTENDED USE, AND WERE ANY OTHERS THAN THE IRAQIS INVOLVED IN SENDING THEM?</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>ORIGIN OF ARMS. THE CENTRAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE IRAQIS ACTED ALONE. WE GATHER THEY MAY VERY WELL HAVE DONE SO IF THEIR PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE WAS TO HARASS IRAN. THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE VERY LITTLE REASON FOR THE IRAQIS ON THEIR OWN TO CARRY OUT AN OPERATION AGAINST PAKISTAN, WITH WHOM THEY APPEAR GENERALLY TO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONS. POSSIBLE THAT BAGHDAD MAY HAVE SEEN STRENGTHENING OF DISSIDENT ELEMENTS IN PAKISTANI BALUCHISTAN AS SERVING ITS INTERESTS AGAINST IRAN, JUSTIFYING RISKS OF OPERATION AGAINST PAKISTAN ITSELF. I SUPPOSE THERE IS ALSO POSSIBILITY THAT SOME ELEMENTS OF IRAQIS BODY-POLITIC SAW REASONS TO CARRY OUT THIS OPERATION, WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF SOME RESPONSIBLE ELEMENTS OF IRAQI GOVT, FOR REASONS NOT NOW PERCEIVABLE TO US.</item>

                            <item>CONSENSUS HERE IS THAT CAREER IRAQI AMB SULEYMAN WAS PATHETIC AND REASONABLY INNOCENT VICTIM OF IRAQI ARMS CAPER. HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING FISHY WAS GOING ON, WITH CASES STACKED IN HIS EMBASSY MARKED FOR OPENING ONLY BY POL ATTACHE AL-SAOUDY. WE GATHER AL-SAOUDY WAS NOT UNDER DIRECT CONTROL OF HIS AMB. WE THINK AMB EITHER CHOSE NOT TO ASK WHAT AL-SAOUDY WAS UP TO IN IMPORTING CASES WITH QUESTIONABLE CONTENTS, OR THAT IF HE ASKED HE WAS TOLD TO MIND HIS OWN BUSINESS. THOSE OF US WHO KNEW AMB SULEYMAN CONSIDERED HIM PRETTY STRAIGHT-FORWARD CHARACTER. HE LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN WASHINGTON AND EXPRESSED FRIENDLY FEELINGS TOWARD US. HE PRESUMABLY HAD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVATIONS REGARDING CURRENT IRAQI LEADERSHIP.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>IF ONE LOOKS FOR ANOTHER PARTY ACTING SOMEHOW IN COLLUSION WITH IRAQIS, CHOICE MOST LOGICALLY FALLS ON USSR. WEAPONS ARE OF SOV ORIGIN, AND SOVS ARE WELL ENTRENCHED IN IRAQ. SOVS HAVE INTERESTS IN SUBCONTINENT AND ELSEWHERE IN ASIA WHICH COULD MOTIVATE THEM TO CARRY OUT CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS AGAIN GOVT. FACTORS COULD INCLUDE DISLIKE OF PAK CLOSENESS TO CHINA, PERSONAL DISTRUST OF <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>, AND DESIRE TO BUILD ON SOVIET STRENGTH IN INDIA. THEN THERE IS OLD STORY OF RUSSIAN DESIRE FOR LAND CORRIDOR TO INDIAN OCEAN-WATERS, WHICH THEY COULD REACH VIA AFGHANISTAN AND A FRIENDLY BALUCHISTAN. AGAINST PRESUMED LOGIC OF POSSIBLE SOV INVOLVMENT IN IRAQ ARMS INCIDENT, I NOTE DOUBTS THAT USSR SEE ITS INTERESTS IN THIS REGION SERVED AT THIS TIME BY STIRRING UP THE POT IN PAKISTAN (SEE ISLAMABAD 1603 EXPATIATING ON THIS SUBJECT). ALSO ONE MUST WONDER WHETHER, IF SOVS WERE INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT, THEY WOULD HAVE DARED TO ALLOW ITS EXECUTION TO REMAIN IN CLUMSY HANDS OF IRAQ (WHICH PERMITTED, FOR EXAMPLE, SOME LOOSE GUNS TO BE SHIPPED IN CANVAS SACKS).</item>

                            <item>PAKISTANIS WITH WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN ARE UNANIMOUS, MORE OR LESS STRONGLY, IN STATING THEY ASSUME SOV INVOLVEMENT (ALTHOUGH ADMITTING HARD PROOF LACKING AS OF NOW). FRENCH AMB ASSUMES SOV INVOLVEMENT, SYRIAN AMB DOES NOT RULE OUT SUCH POSSIBILITY (SEEING IRAQIS AS POSSIBLY RESPONDING TO SOV INTERESTS), AND BRITISH AMB UNDECIDED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN INCLINED BELIEVE SOVS WANTED TO KEEP THIS REGION QUIET AT THIS TIME.</item>

(AT SAME TIME <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SAID AFGHANISTAN ALSO PROBABLY INVOLVED IN SUCH CONSPIRACY). IN TALKING TO NUMBER OF VISITNG BRITISH MPS WHO WERE HERE LAST WHEN <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> AVOIDED IMPLICATING INDIANS DIRECTLY IN ARMS INCIDENT BUT THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH SOVS.

                            <item>INTENDED USE OF WEAPONS. IT IS EASIEST TO PROVIDE POLITICAL REASONING IF ONE ASSUMES THAT IRAQ, ACTING PRESUMABLY ALONE, WANTED GUNS TO CAUSE TROUBLE AGAINST IRAN VIA BALUCHISTAN. UNFORTUNATELY, BALUCHISTAN PREMISE DOES NOT SEEM TO MAKE MUCH SENSE ON LOGISTICAL GROUNDS. LONG, SOFT BALUCHISTAN COASTLINE ON ARABIAN SEA, CONSIDERED TO BE HAVEN FOR SMUGGLERS, APPEARS TO BE MUCH MORE LOGICAL POINT OF ENTRY FOR GUNS FOR BALUCHISTAN. NONE OF THE PERSONS WITH WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN THIS WEEK, MENTIONED ABOVE (INCLUDING IRANIAN CHARGE), GIVES MUCH CREDENCE TO THESIS THAT GUNS WERE ACTUALLY INTENDED FOR USE IN BALUCHISTAN.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>NOR DOES IT SEEM TO MAKE MUCH SENSE THAT GUNS WOULD HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR INFILTRATION INTO OTHER PRINCIPAL PAKISTAN TROUBLE SPOT, THE NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE. EVEN IF THE PATHANS DID NOT ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH WEAPONS OF THEIR OWN, MAINLY OF LOCAL MANUFACTURE, SOV WEAPONS COULD EASILY BE INFILTRATED INTO NWFP ACROSS THE SOFT AFGHAN TRIBAL LAND BORDER.</item>

THIS IS THESIS CURRENTLY FAVORED BY GOP SPOKESMEN, AND IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED EXPLICITLY BY <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>. THEORY IS THAT OUTBREAK OF ARMED VIOLENCE THIS AREA WOULD SOW CONFUSION, TEND TOWARD CHAOS AND WEAKEN GOP ABILITY TO TAKE NECESSARY STEPS TO CONTAIN TROUBLE IN OTHER AREAS SUCH AS BALUCHISTAN AND NWFP. BRITISH AMB FOR ONE, INCLINED TOWARD THIS THESIS.</item>

                            <item>WHERE DO WE COME OUT? I HAVE TO ADMIT NOT ONLY IGNORANCE OF FACTS BUT ALSO UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT IRAQI-SOV ARMS INCIDENT MEANS. INTUITIVELY, I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IRAQ WOULD HAVE PULLED OFF SUCH A CAPER WITHOUT AT LEAST KNOWLEDGE IF NOT COMPLICITY OF SOVS, BUT MAYBE THAT IS SO BECAUSE I MISJUDGE IRAQI CAPABILITY FOR INDEPENDENT IRRESPONSIBLE ACT. ON OTHER HAND, I RECOGNIZE THAT IF SOVS WERE ACCOMPLICES, OR AT LEAST PARTIES BEFORE THE ACT, WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR PREVIOUS VIEW THAT MOSCOW PREFERRED AT THIS TIME TO RELATIVE PEACE IN REGION OF SUBCONTINENT. AS TO INTENDED SPECIFIC USE OF WEAPONS AFTER THEY REACHED IRAQI EMBASSY HERE, I ADMIT SUBSTANTIAL CONFUSION.</item>

                            <item>I CONCLUDE THAT, AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE RICH IN QUESTIONS AND POOR IN FACTS EXCEPT THAT SOME WEAPONS OF SOV ORIGIN WERE SHIPPED COVERTLY BY THE IRAQIS TO ISLAMABAD. ALTHOUGH IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO EMERGE WITH THESE MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES, WE ARE NOT ALONE WITH THEM. THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS TO KEEP ON ALERT FOR FURTHER FACTS, WHILE RECOGNIZING WE MAY NEVER GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS CURIOUS AFFAIR.</item>

                        <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                        <p>March 7, 1973</p>
                        <p>It is desirable now to address a basic decision on military supply for Pakistan. President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s emissary, Governor Khar, will come on March 8 seeking some indication of what Pakistan can count on.</p>
                        <p>The present situation is this:
<list>
                                <item>— The policy now is not to license for export to either India or Pakistan any equipment for significant military use. You have approved releasing about $1 million in equipment which is already owned by Pakistan. But otherwise the general embargo still stands on new military equipment.</item>
                                <item>— This contrasts to a pre-war policy (1967-71) of providing non-lethal equipment and spare parts for previously supplied US-made lethal equipment. This policy was set after the last Indo-Pak war in 1965 under Congressional pressure to suspend supply altogether. It was designed to help the Pakistanis maintain US equipment already supplied and to permit the sale of communications, transportation and other non-combat equipment while staying out of the business of supplying planes, tanks and other major combat items.</item>
                                <item>— The Paks will be pressing us to provide both spares and new combat equipment. This will be one of the main purposes of Governor Khar's visit. He may very well present a substantial list of new equipment Pakistan would like.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>We would like to be as helpful to Pakistan as possible. Theoretically, there are three ways of doing this:
<pb n="2" xml:id="d111-02" facs="d111-02"/>
                            <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The most practical way is to supply equipment directly. That would return the US fully to the arms supply business in a way that has not been the US practice since 1965. Those in Congress who are pressing for a prohibition against all military supply in South Asia would use this as an argument for Congressional action to stop the flow of arms altogether. This step would also be read in India as a US return to comprehensive US military support for Pakistan “directed against India .”</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>If we were not going to supply equipment directly, one theoretical possibility has been to encourage friendly third countries like Iran or Turkey to supply equipment to Pakistan or money to buy equipment. The problem with this approach has been that these countries do not, for the most part, manufacture their own equipment, and the Foreign Assistance Act now prohibits our consenting to transfer of US-made equipment from such third countries unless our policy permits us to supply that same equipment directly. We could encourage Saudis and Iranians to help Pakistan financially to buy arms, but our experience in trying to increase aid for Jordan suggests that not much should be expected along these lines. Thus while we will want to encourage mutual friends to help Pakistan, there will be practical limits on how much equipment can actually be provided in this way.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>We could return to the pre-war of policy of providing spare parts and non-lethal equipment but no planes, tanks or other major combat items. This would not fully satisfy Pakistan, but it would be helpful in permitting the Paks to keep their US-made equipment going. The obvious disadvantage of this policy is that India has a greater capacity to manufacture its own equipment, so Pakistan is more dependent on its outside sources. India and Pakistan, of course, would continue to get equipment from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China respectively.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The issue is the same one we grappled with in 1970 when you decided to make a “one-time exception” to the limited supply policy and provide one sale of armored personnel carriers and some aircraft. The main consideration then was to help Pakistan while avoiding a fundamental change in policy.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d111-03" facs="d111-03"/>
                        <p>The other side of the issue is that Pakistan very much wants both the symbolism of US support via military supply and American equipment, particularly spare parts. The Pakistanis have rebuilt their forces with significant shipments from both China and France, although Pakistan 's weak financial position has limited its ability to buy extensively in France. But they are still anxious for this sign of US support.</p>
                        <p>The main threat to Pakistan at this point seems to be in terms of its own internal cohesiveness, and we are providing substantial economic aid to help with those problems insofar as economic programs are an answer. Nevertheless, Pakistan must have a military force that can preserve internal integrity and permit <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> to negotiate with India from a basis that is as advantageous as the basic balance between the two countries permits. It is in the US interest to help in any way we can to thwart subversion in Pakistan, whoever supports it. And it is in our interest to do what we can in response to ongoing Soviet supply to India.</p>
                        <p>We must, however, deal with the fact that resumption of full-scale military assistance would risk an almost certain Congressionally imposed embargo. Thus it would seem to me that a return to our 1967-71 policy of limited supply is about as far as we can go. This would be a disappointment to President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, but it would be helpful, and we would continue to demonstrate support through sizable economic programs.</p>
                        <p>Apart from this basic decision on long-term policy, you have already made certain decisions on cleaning up past commitments to Pakistan. You have approved releasing to Pakistan $1.1 million worth of equipment which Pakistan owned but was held up here on the docks in 1971 at the time of the war. The physical release of this equipment awaited only the opportunity to initiate general discussions on our relationship with the Indians, which you approved as part of the game plan.</p>
                        <p>In this context, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> and Secretary ROGERS have asked for reconsideration of the earlier decision to release the 300 armored personnel carriers included in the 1970 “one-time exception” to the prohibition on lethal arms supply. The Pakistanis have made a down payment and the equipment is being held in storage for them. Both the Ambassador and the Secretary feel that this will cause a very strong reaction in India which will not be justified by the gain in Pakistan.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d111-04" facs="d111-04"/>
                        <p>I would not minimize the Indian reaction. However, I do not see how we can avoid going through with this earlier commitment. The Indians and those who support their case here will charge that this is just the beginning of a us effort to alter the military balance between India and Pakistan. However, we would be doing no more than reverting to a limited arms supply policy that would not change the military balance that already leans in India 's direction. Moreover, it seems sensible to make this move now when you will want to be at least partially responsive to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s need for reassurance and when India 's tolerance may be at its peak because of strong desire to improve relations with the US. Also, it will be possible to explain this to India in terms of clearing the books of old commitments. Thus, while recognizing the storm this may create, I believe it is best to get this done now and wipe the slate clean. Whatever is decided, we will want to give Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> a chance to explain our policy in Delhi.</p>
                        <p>In addition to this general point, there is one other issue on the Indian side which must be viewed in this context. If we explain release of the armored personnel carriers in terms of cleaning up past commitments, the question of the $87.6 million in old economic aid suspended in 1971 will come up. Without clearing away this element of the past, it will be difficult to normalize our relations. Lifting the suspension would permit us to argue credibly that we are clearing away all past commitments to both India and Pakistan .</p>

                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE</p>
                        <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                        <p>March 7, 1973</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> recently wrote to express his deep concern over what he sees as evidence of Soviet-Indian design on the integrity of Pakistan (Tab A). His most immediate cause for concern was a sizable amount of Soviet-made light arms which he recently seized at the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad. He believes that the Soviets were behind this clandestine arms shipment and that it was intended for dissident elements in the frontier provinces of Pakistan whose ultimate aim, in collusion with the Indians and Afghans, in his view is the final dismemberment of Pakistan. After stressing the threat this presents, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> closes by appealing “for your Government to take a clear and firm decision on your great country's attitude toward my country.” Pakistan, he says, “must know where we stand with our friends.”</p>
                        <p>Certainly we share <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s concern about any indication of Soviet subversive activity in Pakistan. Thus when his letter arrived, we immediately asked <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to review its evidence on this subject. They checked thoroughly in the field and here and report: (1) they have no evidence of a recent increase in Soviet-supported subversive activity in Pakistan; (2) in general, while the Soviets have tried to develop influence among dissident elements apparently for future use, our people have no evidence of a more active effort now such as supplying arms to dissidents. The day after <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> wrote, the Pakistani government itself, for lack of evidence, moved back from its assertion that the Iraqi arms were destined for Pakistani frontier areas. (The other possibility is that the arms were destined for Baluchi dissidents in southeastern Iran, whom the Iraqis would like to stir up.) Thus the important aspect of this letter is its general expression of concern by <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> rather than the specific instance itself.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d112-02" facs="d112-02"/>
                        <p>Given this situation, Secretary ROGERS assumes (Tab C) that the main objective of <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s letter “is to set the stage for the visit here March 8-9 of <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s personal emissary, Governor Khar, whose purpose will be to get our reading of the overall security situation in the area and to learn what Pakistan can expect from us in the arms field.” This is probably partly the case, but it is also true that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is genuinely concerned about possible subversion.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most important aspect of <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s letter is the fact that it evidences a growing uneasiness over the future of his relationship with the US. This may have been exacerbated by the absence of a decision on military supply policy over the long term and the fact that Pakistan is still without a US ambassador after ten months.</p>
                        <p>I am sending you a separate memo on military supply. This can best be relayed to them when you see Governor Khar on March 8. A generally reassuring reply to President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is attached.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't know whether I'll have a chance to see you before the Pakistanis come in later. The issue is…</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: … <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>, State, everyone is violently opposed to doing anything at all for them in the military field. Now, we have a million dollars' worth of old equipment over here, equipment here that they—that is really theirs but that we were rebuilding. We have those 3000-300 armored personnel carriers that they've already paid for. The problem is, the Indians produce more in their own production than the Pakistanis do and this is simply cleaning up old obligations that we've undertaken to them. And we've already told the Chinese and the Iranians that we would do this right after the election, which you had promised prior to the, uh—I mean when you were there. These are all old obligations. That's all.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: So, what—what's the score? What do we—?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My recommendation is to, uh, well…</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: What will it do in the Congress? I suppose that's the problem State's worried about and so forth, or are they just worried about the goddamned Indians?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They're worried about the Indians, but we're going to get tremendous flak again.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Hmmm?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We're going to get the same. State will leak, <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> will leak.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: What should we do? Now, you tell <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> that he cannot leak.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I'm strongly in favor of doing it. We can release the 87 million [dollars] to the Indians at the same time that we blocked at that time and say we're cleaning up all old obligations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: We can say that we're doing this?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I mean these are old contracts. These are not new contracts. My recommendation is that we release—that for both sides all the things that we had blocked.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Um-hmm.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And, uh…</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But you don't have to say this to the Pakistanis now. You have to—you can just listen sympathetically. But anything we discuss with them goes back to the Chinese. And they are in a hell of a spot, and the Indians are trying to kill them. They are now fomenting revolutions in Baluchistan and the Northwest Frontier.</p>

                        <p>DATE AND PLACE: March 8, 1973 at 4:30 p.m. in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s office; the same group except for Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Saunders</persName> and Riza had met at noon with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>

                            </hi> said he could not add a great deal to what had been discussed earlier with the President. He cautioned the Pakistanis not to discuss those matters with the US bureaucracy. Time was required to put the President's decisions into effect. But the President had outlined the direction in which he intends to move.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> continued that our major problem is to establish the principle that it is not logical that one country like India can continue to build up its arms capacity while its neighbor is not permitted to do the same.</p>
                        <p>He concluded his initial comment by saying that to go beyond what the President had indicated earlier in the day would be “totally suicidal” and would invite a sharp Congressional reaction.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Ahmad</hi> asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to let the Pakistanis know about our observations on Indian troop concentrations in India. The Pakistanis felt that all but six Indian divisions were facing Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> asked Mr. Ahmad what he felt would happen over the long term in Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Ahmad</hi> indicated that in the near term Mujib would win the election hands down. Then Pakistan will have to recognize Bangladesh when it is assured that it will get its prisoners back and that there will be no war crimes trials and the status of the Baharis is settled. Once these “irritants” are out of the way, Pakistan will make a strong effort at reconciliation with Bangladesh. Through non-official channels Pakistan has reason to hope that it will get a sympathetic response. However, Mujib is unpredictable and unreliable. He will “promise you the moon if he feels that will make you happy” and then he does not follow through on his promises. Mr. Ahmad noted that the promises he made to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> before he was released from prison in Pakistan were voluntary; <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> had made his release unconditional. But Mujib had not followed through on anything that he had promised.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> asked how Mr. Ahmad felt the relationship between Bangladesh and India would evolve.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Ahmad</hi> replied that the relationship would not be too happy. The opposition in Bangladesh led Bashani openly to attack Mujib with charges that he has sold out to India. He felt that once relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh had been established they could become reasonably good — partly because of this tension with India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> asked whether Pakistan 's relations with the Peoples Republic of China remain good, and Mr. Ahmad replied that they were. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the US has encouraged the Chinese to concentrate on military assistance to Pakistan while we concentrate on economic assistance. He noted, however, that China suffers from shortages of sophisticated equipment. Mr. Ahmad nodded his agreement with this last point.</p>

                            </hi> noted that US relationships with the PRC have evolved very quickly. He said that the Chinese feel very strongly about their friendship with Pakistan.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> then noted that we have a very difficult problem with the Congress, the press and our own bureaucracy. Once the decisions the President had informed the Pakistanis of that morning on arms supply were known, there would be an onslaught of criticism in the press about how the White House is interfering in the process of rebuilding a closer relationship with India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> noted that he was going on vacation on March 16 and there would be decisions before that time. He added, on another subject, that we would aim for a visit by President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in July.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Ahmad</hi> noted that the Iranians and Pakistanis would coordinate their intelligence efforts on greater Baluchistan.</p>

                            </hi> asked that anything they get on Soviet grand strategy in this area would be of interest to the US .</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Ahmad</hi> said that the Pakistanis would appreciate getting from “your chaps” what might be of interest to Pakistan on Soviet intentions towards South Asia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> concluded the meeting by assuring his visitors that he understood what the President wants. The President feels warmly toward Pakistan but, aside from his warm feelings, he understands Soviet strategy and will act accordingly.</p>

                                <item>He realizes that the $1.1 million worth of equipment which already legally belongs to Pakistan but has been held up by the embargo should be released. He says that if there are any noises about this in New Delhi, “I will tell them to pipe down.”</item>

                                <item>He fears, however, that anything beyond this, including the 300 APCs on which the Paks made a down payment under your 1970 one-time exception, would have a “devastating” impact on our relations with India.</item>

                                <item>Finally, he warns against feeding the “fantasies” which the supply of U.S. arms has induced in Pakistan in the past “with disastrous results to themselves, and certainly no notable advantage to American foreign policy.”</item>

MOREOVER, THERE WERE OTHER CASES WHERE WE HAD NOT EXTENDED RECOGNITION AND YET MAINTAINED CONSIDERABLE RELATIONSHIP. DURING LENGTHY EXCHANGE Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA8">Ahmed</persName>'S POSITION BOILED DOWN TO ASSERTION THAT BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCE THEY HAD HAD WITH MUJIB TO DATE, THEY COULD NOT PLACE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN WHAT MUJIB NIGHT DO OR NOT DO ONCE <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> EXTENDED RECOGNITION. PAKISTAN THEREFORE NEEDED SOME CONCRETE ASSURANCE THAT AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO POWS THERE WOULD BE RESPONSE BY MUJIB THAT WOULD PERMIT PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION TO GET UNDERWAY. SECRETARY ASKED IF HIS ASSUMPTION WAS THEREFORE CORRECT THAT GOP WOULD BE PREPARED TO INDICATE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE, QUIETLY TRANSMITTED IN SOME WAY TO BDG, THAT FORMAL RECOGNITION WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WHEN AGREEMENT ON POWS REACHED. <persName>AHMED</persName> RESPONDED AFFIRMATIVELY. NONETHELESS BOTH <persName>AHMED</persName> AND KHAR STRESSED DIFFICULTIES <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> FACED DEALING WITH MUJIB, PARTICULARLY RISK HE FACED THAT MUJIB MIGHT BACK OUT OF ASSURANCES ON POWS AFTER <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAD EXTENDED SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE ON RECOGNITION. <persName>AHMED</persName> NOTED ALSO FACT THAT INDIANS BEING UNHELPFUL, CITING ONE INDIAN STATEMENT TO EFFECT THAT RECOGNITION WOULD “FACILITATE DISCUSSION” BUT NOTHING MORE.</item>

                            <item>Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA8">Ahmed</persName> THEN PROCEEDED TO DESCRIBE PAK CONCERN OVER SOVIET ACTIVITIES AND INTENTIONS IN AREA, NOTING ACCUMULATION OF DISTURBING EVIDENCE OF INCREASED SOVIET INTERFERENCE IN PAK AFFAIRS. AS EXAMPLES CITED, SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN KARACHI LANGUAGE RIOTS AND KARACHI LABOR UNREST. SOVIET AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN CONFRONTED WITH EVIDENCE, INCLUDING FACT MONEY HAD BEEN PASSED. SOVIET RESPONSE WAS TO SAY THAT USSR RECOGNIZED ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT IN PAKISTAN AND ONLY ONE PARTY, BUT <persName>AHMED</persName>

SOVIET AMBASSADOR'S RESPONSE HAD BEEN DEFENSIVE AT TIME AND THERE HAD BEEN NO FORMAL RESPONSE AT ANY TIME THEREAFTER. AHME NOTED ALSO SOVIET TRAWLERS OFF BALUCHISTAN COAST AND FACT THAT SOVIET NAVY UNITS ALSO IN AREA. MEANWHILE, SOVIET ARMS DELIVERIES TO INDIA CONTINUING AT HIGH LEVELS, <persName>AHMED</persName> READING FROM LONG LIST OF DELIVERIES. INDIAN MILITARY BUDGET PROJECTED AT ALL TIME RECORD FOR COMING YEAR. INDIANS ALSO MASSING TROOPS ON PAK BORDERS; WITH EXCEPTION OF 6 DIVISIONS IN NEFA/ASSAM AREA AND ONE ARMORED DIVISION, THE WHOLE OF THEIR ARMED FORCES WERE FOCUSED ON PAK BORDERS. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE WHOLE OF AFGHANISTAN 'S ARMY ALSO WAS ON PAKISTAN 'S BORDERS.</item>

                            <item>CLEARLY ALL THIS WAS NOT DIRECTED AT CHINA; PAKISTAN MUST THEREFORE ASK WHAT ITS PURPOSE MIGHT BE. THERE WAS ALSO WHAT AMOUNTED TO “IRON PINCERS CONCEPT” ON PART SOVIETS; ONE ARM APPARENT IN SOVIET ACTIVITY IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AND THE OTHER IN SOVIET PRESENCE IN INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN. IN BETWEEN LAY IMPORTANT AREA OF IRAN, PAKISTAN AND PERSIAN GULF. <persName>AHMED</persName> SAID HE HAD DESCRIBED THESE CONCERNS TO CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES PREVIOUS DAY, EMPHASIZING PAKISTAN'S DESIRE FOR PEACE WITH INDIA AND STRONG CONCERN AS TO SOVIET AS WELL AS INDIAN INTENTIONS. GOP MIGHT BE WRONG BUT IT APPEARED TO IT THAT SOVIET DESIGN WAS TO EITHER WEAN PAKISTAN FROM CHINESE INFLUENCE, DISMEMBER THE COUNTRY FURTHER, OR PERHAPS SIMPLY TO BRING PAKISTAN UNDER OVERALL SOVIET SECURITY UMBRELLA.</item>

SURE ENOUGH, 6 WEEKS AGO, THIS IDEA HAD BEEN “FORMALLY PUT” TO PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>, SOVIETS APPARENTLY NOTING THAT IF PAKS NOT INTERESTED IN MULTILATERAL ARRANGEMENT <pb n="5" xml:id="d116-05" facs="d116-05"/>OF THIS KIND THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROCEED ON BILATERAL BASIS.</item>

RESPONSE ON HOUSE SIDE HAD BEEN SYMPATHETIC BUT HAD EMPHASIZED THAT THIS WAS EXECUTIVE DECISION AND THAT OPPOSITION LAY IN SENATE. RESPONSE, <persName>AHMED</persName> SAID, FROM SENATE COMMITTEE HAD BEEN MIXED, NOTING INTER ALIA MCGOVERN'S CONCERN OVER ARMS RACE. <persName>AHMED</persName> SAID HE HAD RESPONDED THAT ARMS RACE WOULD NOT BE STOPPED IF ONLY ONE SIDE, INDIANS, CONTINUED TO BE SUPPLIED.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">JHA</persName> SAID INDIAN CONCERN AT US DECISION WAS BASED ON GOI VIEW THAT POLICY DERIVED FROM PAST MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH HAD LONG AFFECTED INDO-US RELATIONS AND CONTRIBUTED TO TENSIONS IN THE SUBCONTINENT. IT SHOULD BE CLEAR TO ALL, HE SAID, THAT INDIA HAD BEEN DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BRING PEACE AND TRANQUILITY TO SOUTH ASIA. THE SIMLA PROCESS HAD ADVANCED SLOWLY BUT SURELY THROUGH THE DELINEATION OF KASHMIR LINE OF CONTROL AND TROOP WITHDRAWALS. NOW THINGS WERE STALLED ON THE QUESTION OF BANGLADESH RECOGNITION BY PAKISTAN. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAD ORIGINALLY GIVEN PROMISES ON RECOGNITION AT SIMLA. THEN HAVE HAD INDICATED THAT THE BANGLADESH ELECTIONS MIGHT PROVIDE AN <pb n="2" xml:id="d117-02" facs="d117-02"/>OPPORTUNITY. THE GOI HAD HOPED THAT PAKISTANI RECOGNITION OF BANGLADESH WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE BEFORE THE US ARMS POLICY DECISION. IF PAKISTAN FELT DEFENSELESS WITHOUT ARMS, BY WHOM DID THEY FEEL THREATENED? IF, HOWEVER, THE PURPOSE WAS POLITICAL RATHER THAN MILITARY SUPPORT, WHAT POLITICAL POSTURE OR POSITION WAS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE NEW US POLICY, <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">JHA</persName> ASKED?</item>

HE COMMENTED THAT INDIAN PUBLIC WOULD NOTE THAT PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF ARMS DECISION BENEFITTING PAKISTAN PRECEDED ANNOUNCEMENT OF RELEASE OF SUSPENDED ECONOMIC AID TO INDIA, WHICH WOULD RAISE QUESTIONS IN THEIR MINDS CONCERNING US PRIORITIES AND INTENTIONS. HE NOTED THAT ECONOMIC AID TO PAKISTAN HAD BEEN RESUMED LONG AGO, AND OPINED THAT LIFTING OF INDIAN AID SUSPENSION SIX MONTHS EARLIER WOULD HAVE PUT MILITARY SUPPLY DECISION IN DIFFERENT LIGHT. PROCEDURALLY, <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">JHA</persName> SAID HE FELT THERE HAD BEEN INADEQUATE CONSULTATION PRIOR TO THE DECISION AND THAT WHILE GOI HAD BEEN INFORMED IN ADVANCE IN NEW DELHI, INDIAN EMBASSY HAD NOT BEEN SO INFORMED. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> REPLIED THAT WE HAD KEPT INDIAN EMBASSY INFORMED OF DIRECTION OF OUR THINKING PRIOR TO DECISION AND HAD TAKEN PARTICULAR PAINS TO INFORM GOI OF DECISION PRIOR TO OUR PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT.</item>

WE RECOGNIZE THE SPECIAL POLITICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEANING WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE QUESTION OF ARMS SUPPLY IN THE SUBCONTINENT. WE DO NOT BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS DECISION CAN BE CONSTRUED TO HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE RATIO OF MILITARY STRENGTH IN THE AREA. WE HOPE THAT THE US DECISION DID NOT REALLY COME AS A SURPRISE TO THE GOI. WE BELIEVE IT IS IN OUR MUTUAL INTEREST THAT IN THE CASE OF SPARE PARTS AND OTHER ITEMS INCLUDED IN THE DECISION PAKISTAN BE ABLE TO TURN IN OUR DIRECTION, AND NOT LOOK EXCLUSIVELY IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CONTRIBUTES TO OUR MUTUAL OBJECTIVE OF STABILITY IN THE AREA. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> REAFFIRMED US SUPPORT FOR THE WHOLE SIMLA PROCESS, CITING THE ACHIEVEMENT WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE IN REDUCING TENSIONS AND DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR RELATIONS.</item>

WE BELIEVED IT WOULD SERVE OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS FOR THE GOI TO PLACE THE DECISIONS IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE. THE LIFTING OF THE AID SUSPENSION SHOULD BE SEEN AS A FIRST BONA FIDE OF THE US DESIRE TO MOVE FORWARD ON SPECIFIC QUESTIONS INVOLVED IN IMPROVING OUR RELATIONS.</item>

                        <p>A. I HAVE A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT WHICH YOU MAY WISH TO<lb/>TAKE A MOMENT TO READ. —- HE IS DEEPLY SERIOUS IN WHAT HE WRITES.<lb/>HE WOULD NOT HAVE ASKED ME TO COME BACK INTO GOVERNMENT IF THIS<lb/>SECRET</p>

                        <p>B. THERE IS ONE CENTRAL CONCEPT IN HIS THINKING AT THIS TIME. <lb/>THIS IS THAT A “NEW SITUATION” HAS EVOLVED IN SOUTH ASIA SINCE<lb/>THE EVENTS OF MID-1971. THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THIS NEW SITUATION<lb/>ARE CLEAR TO US, AS THEY WOULD BE TO ANY OBJECTIVE OBSERVER.<lb/>WE SEE NO PROSPECT THAT THEY WILL CHANGE, NOR HAVE WE ANY<lb/>DESIRE THAT THEY SHOULD DO SO.</p>
                        <p>C. WE WISH NOW TO RESUME RELATIONS THAT WERE INTERRUPTED IN<lb/>MID-1971 ON THE BASIS OF THIS NEW SITUATION. AS I EXPLAINED TO<lb/>THE FOREIGN SECRETARY YESTERDAY, THIS MEANS CLEARING UP A FEW<lb/>PAST UNDERTAKINGS ABOUT WHICH WE FEEL WE MADE FIRM COMMITMENTS,<lb/>AND THEN GETTING ON WITH THE FUTURE. THESE COMMITMENTS WERE<lb/>BOTH TO INDIA AND PAKISTAN.</p>
                        <p>D. I AM ASKED TO MAKE ONE POINT MOST EXPLICITLY, WHICH IS<lb/>THAT THE PRESIDENT' S DECISION TO CLEAR UP THE BOOKS ALSO<lb/>INVOLVED A CONSCIOUS DECISION ON HIS PART NOT TO OPEN UP A MILITARY<lb/>SUPPLY LINE TO PAKISTAN, BUT MERELY TO CLEAR UP THE BOOKS. <lb/>THERE WERE NO AIRPLANES, NO TANKS, AND NO ARTILLERY INVOLVED.<lb/>THE REMAINDER OF THE “ONE- TIME EXCEPTION” OF 1970 IS REGARDED<lb/>AS HAVING LAPSED. OUR POLICY HENCEFORTH WILL BE NOT TO SUPPLY<lb/>LETHAL ARMS TO ANY NATION OF THE SUBCONTINENT. WE BELIEVE<lb/>WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR ARMS SUPPLIER IN THE WORLD WHICH HAS SUCH<lb/>A POLICY. CLEARLY THE EXISTING MILITARY RATIOS ON THE SUBCONTINENT<lb/>CAN NEVER BE ALTERED AS A RESULT OF ANY AMERICAN ACTION UNDER<lb/>THIS POLICY. THE FOREIGN SECRETARY, SPEAKING FOR YOU AND FOR THE<lb/>MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, EXPRESSED TO ME THE GRAVE<lb/>CONCERN OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA AT THE ACTIONS MY GOVERNMENT<lb/>HAS TAKEN, AND I IMMEDIATELY, OF COURSE, RELAYED THIS CONCERN<lb/>TO WASHINGTON. AND YET I DO HOPE YOU WILL SEE THAT THE NEW<lb/>SITUATION IN SOURTH ASIA HAS NOT CHANGED, AND WILL NOT CHANGE<lb/>AS A RESULT OF AMERICAN POLICIES.</p>
                        <p>E. THE UNITED STATES NOW HOPES TO DEVELOP A NEW RELATIONSHIP<lb/>BETWEEN OUR NATIONS ON THE BASIS OF MUTUAL RESPECT FOR EACH<lb/>OTHER' S INTERESTS. INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE BOTH WORLD<lb/>POWERS AND THAT MEANS A HEAVY AND CONTINOUS SET OF RESPONSIBILITIES<lb/>AND CONCERNS. IT PROBABLY MEANS WE WILL NOT ALWAYS SEE MATTERS</p>

                        <p>IN PRECISELY THE SAME PERSPECTIVE. AND YET WE ARE NATURAL FRIENDS<lb/>AND HAVE NO CONFLICTING INTERESTS BETWEEN US. WE FOR EXAMPLE<lb/>VERY MUCH HOPE THE SIMLA ACCORDS WILL MOVE FORWARD. WE HAVE<lb/>RECOGNIZED BANGLADESH, AND ARE PROVIDING A GREAT DEAL OF AID TO<lb/>THAT NATION, AND EXPECT IT WILL CONTINUE TO NEED SUCH AID FOR<lb/>A CONSIDERABLE WHILE. WE HOPE THERE WILL BE A BILATERAL SOLUTION<lb/>TO THE PRESENT SITUATION. IN A WORD, WE HOPE FOR A NORMAL<lb/>RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA AS OF ONE WORLD POWER TO ANOTHER. <lb/>WE EACH SHARE THE FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST OF OTHER WORLD POWERS<lb/>IN PEACE AND A RISING DEGREE OF COOPERATION,</p>
                        <p>F. I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE ONE SUBSTANTIVE MATTER. AS A RESULT<lb/>OF AID WHICH THE UNITED STATES PROVIDED INDIA WHEN IT WAS A<lb/>NEW NATION, AND FURTHER AID THAT CAME ABOUT IN THE AFTERMATH<lb/>OF SERIOUS DROUGHTS IN THE 1960S, THE UNITED STATES HAS ACCUMULATED<lb/>A VERY LARGE SUM OF SO- CALLED PL 480 FUNDS. THE UNITED STATES<lb/>ACCOUNT PRESENTLY AMOUNTS TO SOME 685 CORERES OF RUPEES (DOLS<lb/>914 MILLION), AND WILL RISE TO 4,200 CRORES ( DOLS 5.603<lb/>BILLION). THIS IS AN UNNATURAL CONDITION TO EXIST BETWEEN<lb/>TWO WORLD POWERS. IT IS AN INEVITABLE SOURCE OF ANXIETY AND<lb/>STRAIN, NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES USES THESE RUPEES<lb/>FOR LOCAL EXPENDITURES OF THE US EMBASSY IN INDIA. FINANCE<lb/>MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> HAS SAID THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT CANNOT GO ON<lb/>INDEFINITELY. WE AGREE. AND WE WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH HIS<lb/>STATEMENT THAT “ IF A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION IS NOT FOUND TO THIS<lb/>PROBLEM, PERHAPS IT MAY REMAIN WITH US FOREVER.” WE THINK A<lb/>SATISFACTORY SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF<lb/>INDIA WOULD AGREE TO PROVIDE FOR OUR LOCAL EXPENSES FOR A<lb/>FIXED PERIOD OF YEARS, AGREE TO DEVOTE SOME FURTHER PART OF THE<lb/>RESOURCES TO USEFUL ACTIVITIES WHICH WOULD BE CARRIED OUT<lb/>WHOLLY UNDER INDIAN DIRECTION, AND THEN WRITE THE REST OFF.<lb/>ONCE THIS AGREEMENT IS REACHED THE MATTER WOULD BE DONE WITH<lb/>FOR GOOD AND ALL. I WOULD LIKE PERMISSION TO BEGIN DISCUSSIONS<lb/>OF THIS WITH WHOMEVER THE PRIME MINISTER DESIGNATES.</p>
                        <p>2. MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> TOOK MILD EXCEPTION TO THE DESCRIPTION OF INDIA<lb/>AS A WORLD POWER, SAYING THAT INDIA DID NOT BELIEVE IN POWER<lb/>POLITICS AND IN ANY EVENT DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACT<lb/>AS OTHER NATIONS HAD DONE IN THE PAST. INDIA HAD BEEN INVADED<lb/>FIVE TIMES SINCE OBTAINING FREEDOM. THIS HAD CAUSED A DESPERATE<lb/>STRAIN ON HER RESOURCES. THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT “ON THE MAT”<lb/>WITH RESPECT TO THE AMERICAN DECISION TO RESUME ARMS SHIPMENTS.</p>

                        <p>DATE AND PLACE: Tuesday, March 27, at 2:30 p.m. in Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s office for 20 minutes</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> expressed his pleasure in meeting the Finance Minister. He noted with a smile that finance is “not my best subject.” Then he said, looking at <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>, that some people have said that foreign policy is “not always my best subject either.” <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> demurred. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> “is the only person in Washington who handles the press better than I do.” During the difficulties between India and the United States he could always tell where the stories were coming from, but there was nothing could do about them. Seriously, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that we in Washington are all very sorry to see <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> leave.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> said that <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> would be returning to India “to do a good job there.” [<persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> will be Governor of Kashmir.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> said that <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> had been in Washington in a very difficult period. He had defended India's interest “with enormous ability.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> said that he had seen Secretary Shultz earlier and had made several points. He had noted to the Secretary that one of the major questions between India and the US now is the question of US holdings of rupees. He felt that it was good to start talks on this subject and noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> had already suggested that talks begin.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi> asked whether we had any specific ideas as to how we wish to handle these talks. Would we do it in Washington; would we send somebody to Delhi; or would we have our embassy handle it?</p>

                            </hi> asked what would be most efficient.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> suggested sending someone at a high level who might make some decisions on the spot.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> asked whether the solution in the <persName corresp="#p_SRJ3">Saulnier</persName> Report would be acceptable to India .</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi> said that India had never been shown the <persName corresp="#p_SRJ3">Saulnier</persName> Report, although Indians felt that <persName corresp="#p_SRJ3">Saulnier</persName> had understood their point of view.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> said that we could operate within the framework of the <persName corresp="#p_SRJ3">Saulnier</persName> study. He indicated that he had made technical study of the issue. He felt, however, that we have no interest in holding a balance of rupees that would become a political issue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> indicated that that is what is happening.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> went on to say that a second issue he raised with Secretary Shultz had been the point that the government of India does not want to keep its economic relationship with the US solely on an economic aid basis. It is useful to maintain contact on monetary issues such as has been the case in connection with activities of the Committee of 20. It is also important to consider what can be done in the field of trade. In the textile field, for instance, India is kept on the same level as Japan in terms of US import regulations. India feels that developing countries should be put on some sort of different basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> noted that the US textile lobby is very strong and very short-sighted. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> affirmed this. <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> continued by noting that India differed from Japan in that it does not export any synthetics and it concentrates in specialized areas.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> indicated that, on trade, we would be prepared to have serious discussions to see how trade might be stimulated. He asked what sort of mechanism <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> had in mind for carrying on this dialogue. Did he see a special mechanism or did he foresee maintaining the discussions on an ad hoc basis?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> said that for the moment he felt it would best to continue on an informal basis talking about issues as they come up.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d119-03" facs="d119-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi> said that he felt that the textile question was a specialized one. Some negotiations were coming up. If prior to those negotiations some people in the US textile industry could observe the Indian textile industry, he felt it would be possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> said that we would encourage a forward-looking approach. We in the White House will pay personal attention to this field.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> turned to the subject of aid. It is a complex problem how to continue or to start again in this relationship now that we have arrived at the point where we are. In principle, the US is interested in the favorable evolution of the Indian economy and want India to be economically stable. He noted that, in an earlier discussion with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>, he had talked about the possibility of our establishing a framework for phasing out aid over some period such as five years; or perhaps it would be possible to find some other framework for an economic assistance relationship that would have a new look.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> said that he felt that the major emphasis should be on the credit side rather than on aid. He felt that the major relationship would be US contributions through IDA. He also felt that US leadership in the World Bank Consortium was important.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>
                            </hi> interjected that the main point was that if the US were to pull out of the World Bank Consortium it would fall apart. One way of proceeding would be to work toward a period over the next five or six years where there would be no new net aid. At that point just enough new aid would be going to India to maintain a balance with Indian repayments. However, India would welcome US thoughts. The simplest way for the US to proceed might simply be to return to a normal role in the consortium. If one pursued this line of approach, a point would be reached in about five years where the balance would come to zero aid either way—-that is, as much aid would be going into India as was necessary to repay former loans. At this point, debt rescheduling would become an essential element in the picture.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> said that we are prepared to work seriously at improving relations. Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> replied that he would convey this to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> continued by saying that sometimes small things make problems. He referred particularly to the US decision to renew arms supply to Pakistan. He noted that the Pakistanis now only have to defend half the territory they had before the 1971 war while India still has to <pb n="4" xml:id="d119-04" facs="d119-04"/>face both China and Pakistan. A decision such as the Us had made creates pressure on the Indian Government not just from one party but from all parties across the political spectrum.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi> noted that “you should have heard our Ambassador in New Delhi.” We had to urge him to observe some restraint. The US decision has been a fulfillment of old commitments. “We have no intention of starting a pipeline of new military equipment to Pakistan .” There is a situation in which India produces a substantial amount of military equipment for itself, and Pakistan produces very little. If one looks ahead, one must assume that the gap between the two will widen. Therefore, we are not narrowing the gap by what we have done. “Nor do we have any intention of extending credits or starting a new program.” We understand India's feelings, but we note that India has handled the issue in a restrained manner.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> continued that we find it difficult to read certain things in the India press. For instance, last summer we heard over and over again that the purpose of the US was to wean Bangladesh away from India. US objectives in Bangladesh, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> felt, are parallel to India's. While we did not agree with the methods used in achieving Bangladesh independence, our interest now is in a stable Bangladesh making reasonable progress. We do not see Bangladesh as part of a great power constellation. We are prepared to coordinate our aid to Bangladesh with India's if that seems desirable. Our feeling is that if a radical element were to take over in Bangladesh, it would have serious consequences in West Bengal. While US relations with the PRC are improving, we do not have the same interest as China's in Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> indicated the India is taking many initiatives to solve the problems bilaterally—even with Pakistan. Indians interpreted the US decision on arms supply as disturbing the balance in that effort to solve problems on a bilateral basis. India wants normal relations with everyone.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> said that we support the bilateral solutions of South Asian problems. There is no US interest served by perpetuation of the Pakistani-Indian impasse. From a humanitarian point of view, the prisoners of war are a concern to us, especially because of our own recent experience on a much smaller scale.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d119-05" facs="d119-05"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that, during Pakistani Governor Khar's visit, we had recommended strongly to Pakistan that they recognize Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> responding to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s point on the prisoners, noted the numbers of Bengalees being held in Pakistan. Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he understood that the Pakistanis were prepared to let them go.</p>
                        <p>Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> continued that we would not take an initiative on Indian-Pakistani problems. However, if it would help and if both sides asked us to, we would be prepared to make a proposal on the prisoners. However, we did not intend to get involved on our initiative.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> responded that that was a fair position.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked which job the Minister had found more interesting—Defense or Finance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi> responded that he had also help the post as Home Minister and had not found it possible to compare of the three jobs. They were so different. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that a former student of his at Harvard, L.P. Singh, had held the role of Secretary in the Home Ministry. Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> noted that <persName>Singh</persName> was an excellent person. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted he has many students and friends all over India from his Harvard days. He often receives letters from them when there are difficulties between India and the US.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> concluded that the principle reason he had wanted to see Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> was that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> is a senior member of the Indian Government and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wanted the opportunity to tell him directly that the US recognizes India as a major country with which we want good relations.</p>

Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> said that he would be leaving April 12 and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> would be in Washington early in May.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I've never been to Kashmir, you came and told me it's beautiful. Mr. Nehru, you know, he had this great feeling in his heart for Kashmir, and, of course, he was from there. But I wanted to say to you as you go that we—that I, as <persName>Henry</persName> has probably told you, I normally can't see—I usually see ambassadors when they come, I don't get to see them very often when they leave. I would like to see every one, but I wanted to see you and welcome the opportunity for reasons that are obvious. One, because the country you represent and what it means to the world; and it's a major country, a very major country; the number of people; the place that it is geographically; the role it can play. Second, also because I think you personally have worked so hard under very difficult circumstances for a good relationship between the U.S. and India. We've had some rocky times, the war thing, and now this last little blip about cleaning up that Pakistan aid thing and so forth and so on. I must say, incidentally, that I have appreciated the restraint that has been shown on that. It's a hard decision for us. It was, as you know, not one that was in any way designed to create any threat to India. And it does not. The important thing now though is that the suspicions and this constant confrontation and so forth, which seems to get into the public press, between India and the U.., that we try to dampen down, because for better or worse, let's face it, we are the two biggest democracies in the world, yours and ours. Each of us has much to give to the other. Each of us has an enormous interest in maintaining our freedom and in working towards a more peaceful world. And for us to be in a position that we are with India, I mean in the minds of many people, many people in the world, that India and the U.S. are always opposed is not healthy, not a good thing for you. It isn't good for us. Now, what we do about it? It isn't just a state visit, the tipping of glasses, the nice, little speeches which we've had, but it's hard, day-to-day work on some of these things. But, I want you to convey to the Prime Minister that I sent <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> there because he's a very close, personal associate. He deeply wanted to go. He loves America, but he loves also your country, and he—And I sent him there because I wanted to have a positive, a more positive development in the relations between our countries. The, uh—We must not allow, now with Pakistan divided, I mean with sincerity, we must not allow differences about that, or differences about other things, to blind us to the overall interest that we have in a continuing, healthy, constructive relationship. Now, let me say this: not so much in this country, although there are some, but in your country, as you well know, as there are in most countries in the world it's—there's a considerable number, a body of opinion, some in the press, some in the Parliament, and the rest who sort of make a profession out of being anti-U.S. I understand that. It's true in Latin America. It's true in Europe and so forth and so on, and the Soviet [Union]. I have no—And I understand it, but the point is that I simply want to say without any sentimentality—although some sentiment might be involved in this—but, basically, not based on that, but based on the interests we share, the interests of the world for people, the interests in the maintenance of the great, free nations requires that India and the United States have a better relationship. And you, you had to take it over a rocky period, and we hope your successor will come here and, perhaps, work cooperatively toward that end because if it goes the other way then each of us will have to look another way, in other directions. And you don't want that, and we don't want it either. That's the way I would like to—So, I've tried to speak quite frankly about it and I think. Another thing that I did is to say, finally, is this that you get the impression that—which I—from some reports, some speeches that have been made, that—and I realize a lot of this throughout the war in Vietnam, which fortunately is now over and the rest, but none of this—but you get it, and a lot of it throughout India, it reminds us of the India-Pakistan flare up, that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is anti-Indian and anti-Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> sort of thing. That's baloney. That is not true. I have never been and never will be, because I want good relations. So, and the impression that whoever is president of the United States is basically against the biggest democracy in the world is not a healthy one to have. It's just [unclear]It's not healthy for the other—for the superpowers to think that, it isn't healthy for your neighbors to think that, it isn't healthy, certainly, for people in this country to think that. And finally, apart from its not being healthy, it's just not true. So, these are some of the things that I hope you take with you, and I hope you take some pleasant memories, too.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName>: I can take very happy memories, sir, and I must say throughout a very difficult period one of the things that sustained me. [Unclear] communication I've had with <persName>Henry</persName> who has known your mind and thinking.</p>

[Unclear], but I do feel that we are now set on a course which can lead to far better relations than even we had known in the [unclear].

I'll go more than half way and I have great respect for her not because she is a woman, but because she's a great leader. I have great respect for her because she's a skillful politician.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What we have set up is, Mr. President, on your instructions, is some more or less regular meetings between <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> and senior Indian officials…</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Good.</p>

No, we get along with his successor but the main thing is that whoever represents, it's pleasant to have somebody that we have as such confidence and respect for. Whoever represents a great country like India we'll get along with them.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I must say one other thing, Mr. President, that L.K.—he was more skillful in handling the press than any other ambassador here. I could see his fine hand in a lot of columnists when it was, when necessity required it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Look, the Indians are among the most skillful people in the world at handling the press as you know.</p>

THE OPPOSITION, THOUGH WEAK AND FRAGMENTED, IS VOCIFEROUS ON THESE AND OTHER ISSUES AND HAS PROVOKED THE PRIME MINISTER TO CHARGEIT WITH “REACTION” AND “COLLUSION” WITH UNSPECIFIED FOREIGN COUNTRIES (READ US AND CHINA ). THE PRESS, WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY GIVEN MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, IS NOW INCLINED TO POINT OUT GOVERNMENT FAILINGS - WHICH ARE PRINCIPALLY IN THE ECONOMIC AREA - IN SHARPLY CRITICAL FASHION.

A CONCURRENT POLICY OF ECONOMIC NATIONALISM BOTH HEAVILY RESTRICTS OPPORTUNITIES TO INDIA FOR NEW FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND DIMS THE PROSPECTS FOR MANY FOREIGN COMPANIES ALREADY ESTABLISHED HERE.

                        <p>INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND US ARMS: PROOF OF THE POLICY IS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION</p>
                        <p>Initial reactions to the March 14 US announcement of resumed arms supply to South Asia were enthusiastic in Pakistan and critical in India. Subsequent official comment has been muted, suggesting that although both governments have reservations, they are temporarily pacified. Their final assessments will await clarification on the amount and nature of military supplies which will be available to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">India — Skeptical Acquiescence</hi>. Following its initially sharp criticism, the Indian Government has adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the US decision. On March 14 and 15 Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName> expressed India's “grave concern,” but since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>'s call on Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, official comment has been minimal and muted. Although Indian officials are unhappy to see any arms shipments to Pakistan, there are indications that some see a net benefit to India. Several influential newspapers have carried well-informed and probably officially inspired articles which accentuate the positive aspects for India of US policy statements accompanying the decision. The pro-Western Statesman proposed March 22 that US statements are “in the direction of recognizing that the current power equation — clearly in India's favor— is justified and is in the interest of all to preserve.” More concrete evidence that <pb n="2" xml:id="d122-02" facs="d122-02"/>the Indian Government does not intend to “go to the mat” with the US on the arms decision is contained in Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>'s statement of March 20 welcoming the US restoration of $87 million in suspended economic credits for India. Leftist elements in India had argued against Indian acceptance of the credit. Furthermore, the March 21 Hindu reported that India is reconsidering its restrictions on Indo-American cultural exchanges.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the US decision may have made Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> more cautious in proceeding toward an Indo-US detente. A significant portion of the Indian press is critical of the arms decision. The March 27 National Herald, which often provides an outlet for Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s private views, chose the decision as a peg for a broadside attack on US motives in South Asia. Moreover, in recent days Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> and Congress Party President Sharma have made several speeches critical of US policy in language reminiscent of the October “<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> exposure” campaign.</p>
                        <p>It is too early for a firm reading on Indian policy decisions in response to the arms decision, and probably none have been made. Debate undoubtedly will continue within the Indian Government, perhaps often by proxy through speeches and the press, on how India should respond. At present it appears that the Government will continue to seek an improvement in relations with the US but will carefully measure the magnitude of US arms sales to Pakistan in calculating the pace of India's efforts toward detente.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Pakistan — Hopeful for More</hi>. In Pakistan's view, the decision does not go far enough: In a March 15 speech, President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> welcomed the decision, but pointed out that, since it was made in the context of an US-Pakistani bilateral agreement which is still valid, he considers the US has not been fulfilling its obligation under that agreement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s pointed reference to Pakistan's bilateral agreement with the US seems designed to encourage the possibility of a return to the US-Pakistani “special relationship” of the 1950's. The Pakistanis undoubtedly harbor a latent hope that, with appropriate support from the US (and China), a psychological if not military balance of power is possible between India and Pakistan. Several Pakistani newspapers have interpreted the US decision as contributory to a restoration of the balance of power in the subcontinent, thus indicating that the concept is very much on the Pakistani mind. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> undoubtedly will be pressing for maximum liberality in US implementation of its arms supply policy when he visits the US. Until then the Pakistanis probably will continue to play the decision in low key, satisfied that it represents at least an initial step in buttressing Pakistan's self-confidence in its relationship with India.</p>

                            <item>FOREIGN AFFAIRS: THE GOP'S MAIN PREOCCUPATION IS TO REACH A SATISFACTORY ACCOMMODATION WITH INDIA. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAS A REALISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE 1971 WAR AND THE NEED FOR A NEW SET OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE COUNTRIES OF THE SUBCONTINENT. THIS UNDERSTANDING WAS REFLECTED IN THE SIMLA AGREEMENT OF JULY 1972. ITS IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN HAMPERED, HOWEVER BY THE LEGACY OF A QUARTER CENTURY OF MISTRUST AND HOSTILITY PLUS (IN <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S EYES) THE INADEQUACY OF PAKISTAN'S BARGAINING ASSETS AS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE OTHERS.</item>

                            <item>PROGRESS TOWARD AN ACCOMMODATION CURRENTLY IS STYMIED BY THE POW ISSUE. INDIA REFUSES TO RELEASE THE POWS WITHOUT BANGLADESH CONCURRENCE: BANGLADESH DECLINES EVEN TO DISCUSS THEIR RELEASE UNTIL PAKISTAN RECOGNIZES BANGLADESH AND APPEARS DETERMINED TO HOLD SOME OF THE POWS FOR WAR CRIMES TRIALS, BUT HAS NOT SPECIFIED HOW MANY; <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>, IN TURN, FEELS HE CANNOT RECOGNIZE BANGLADESH WITHOUT PRIOR ASSURANCE THAT (A) THE POWS WILL BE RELEASED RATHER THAN HELD FOR FURTHER BARGAINING AND (B) WAR CRIMES TRIALS, IF THEY MUST BE HELD AT ALL, WILL INVOLVE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF PRISONERS PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE POW ISSUE. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SAYS HE CANNOT IMPLEMENT OTHER PARTS OF THE SIMLA AGREEMENT, SUCH AS RESTORATION OF TRADE AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH INDIA, BECAUSE THESE MEASURES WOULD BE DEEPLY RESENTED BY THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN AS LONG AS INDIA CONTINUED TO HOLD THE POWS. PROSPECTS FOR BREAKING THIS IMPASSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE ARE PROBLEMATICAL, WITH EACH SIDE INSISTING SOMEONE ELSE MUST TAKE THE FIRST STEP. SOME OUTSIDERS HAVE SUGGESTED A PACKAGE APPROACH, PERHAPS WITH A THIRD PARTY (POSSIBLY THE UNSYG) TO SERVE AS GUARANTOR AND CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATIONS.</item>

                            <item>NEXT TO INDIA, PAKISTAN'S FOREIGN POLICY CONCERNS ARE FOCUSED ON THE “BIG THREE”: CHINA, THE SOVIET UNION, AND THE US. OF THE THREE, PAKISTAN FEELS ITSELF CLOSEST TO CHINE, WHICH IT SEES AS THE ONE MAJOR POWER THAT HAS INVARIABLY SUPPORTED PAKISTAN. CHINA, IN TURN, IS PAKISTAN'S MAJOR SUPPLIER OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND SERVES AS THE <pb n="3" xml:id="d123-03" facs="d123-03"/>GOP'S CHAMPION IN THE DIPLOMATIC ARENA. RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION ARE CORRECT BUT SOMEWHAT COOL. THE GOP WOULD WELCOME BETTER RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW BUT IS CONCERNED OVER SOVIET PARTIALITY TO INDIA AND OVER LONG-TERM SOVIET INTENTIONS TOWARD SOUTH ASIA. (THE GOP ALSO TENDS TO PLAY UP ITS CONCERN AS A MEANS OF ATTRACTING GREATER SUPPORT FROM THE US.)</item>

PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAS PUBLICLY EXPRESSED PAKISTAN'S GRATITUTDE FOR US ECONOMIC AID AND THE RECENT RESUMPTION OF LIMITED MILITARY SALES HAS BEEN WELCOMED AS A FURTHER INDICATOR OF US FRIENDSHIP. THE GOP GENERALLY DISPLAYS A SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING OF US INTERESTS, ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT HESITATE TO TAKE CONTRARY POSITIONS ON VARIOUS ISSUES WHEN ITS OWN INTERESTS DICTATE.</item>

THE GOP PARTICULARLY VALUES ITS CLOSE TIES WITH IRAN.</item>

ALTHOUGH THE NUMBERS OF HIS CRITICS HAS INCREASED IN RECENT MONTHS, HE RETAINS WIDESPREAD POPULARITY AND HAS NO SERIOUS RIVAL ON THE NATIONAL SCENE. MEANWHILE, THE MILITARY SERVICES SEEM BY AND LARGE TO BE ESCHEWING POLITICS. A MASTER AT POLITICAL MANIPULATION, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SHOULD REMAIN IN POWER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.</item>

REGIONALIST SENTIMENT EXPLOITED BY THE PRINCIPAL OPPOSITION PARTY, THE NATIONAL AWAMI PARTY (NAP) RUNS HIGH IN BALUCHISTAN AND IN NORTH WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE, AND BALUCH AND PATHAN GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PUNJABI <pb n="5" xml:id="d123-05" facs="d123-05"/>MAJORITY, REAL OR IMAGINED, ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE.

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> PERCEIVES, PROBABLY CORRECTLY THAT PAKISTAN REQUIRES A STRONG CHIEF EXECUTIVE. AT THE SAME TIME, HE IS PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO GREATER MATERIAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE POPULATION. HE MAY, LIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, ULTIMATELY MOVE TOWARD INCREASING AUTHORIATARIANISM AS HE FACES THE HARD REALITIES OF LIMITED RESOURCES AND LIMITED CAPABILITY.</item>

                            <item>POLITICAL-MILITARY: PAKISTAN'S DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT, TOTALING ABOUT 500,000 MEN, IE PROFESSIONAL, DISCIPLINED, WELL-TRAINED AND GENERALLY COMPETENT. ITS MOST SERIOUS DEFICIENCY IS IN EQUIPMENT, A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WHICH IS OF PRE-1965 VINTAGE FROM THE US. OUR RECENT DECISION ON MILITARY SUPPLY WILL EASE THE SPARE PARTS PROBLEM BUT WILL NOT RESOLVE THE BROADER PROBLEM OF OBSOLESCENCE. CHINA IS THE PRIMARY SUPPLIER OF NEW MILITARY EQUIPMENT BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT PAKISTAN FEELS IT NEEDS. FRANCE AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE SUPPLYING SOME MODERN FIGHTER AIRCRAFT AND OTHER SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT ON COMMERCIAL TERMS.</item>

                            <item>PAKISTAN'S ARMED FORCES, WOULD BE NO MATCH FOR INDIA IN AN ALL-OUT WAR, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CAPABLE MAINTAINING INTERNAL SECURITY AND OF DEFENDING THE COUNTRY AGAINST ATTACK FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER (EXCEPT ONE LED BY THE SOVIET UNION), PAKISTAN'S PRESENT DEFENSE GOAL IS TO CREATE A DETERRENT TO INDIAN ATTACK BY DEVELOPING FORCES STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT A QUICK AND RELATIVELY PAINLESS INDIAN VICTORY. THE CURRENT EFFORT TO RE-EQUIP THE PAK ARMED FORCES FOR THIS MISSION IS STRAINING PAKISTAN'S RESOURCES. THE MILITARY BUDGET FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IS APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE TOTAL FEDERAL BUDGET AND NEARLY SEVEN PERCENT OF GNP.</item>

THE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK BENEFITS FROM THE SECOND SUCCESSIVE YEAR OF AN EXCELLENT COTTON CROP AND CONTINUED HIGH WORLD COTTON PRICES, CONTINUED FOREIGN DEMAND FOR PAKISTAN'S TEXTILES; PROSPECTS FOR A RECORD WHEAT CROP; AND IMPROVED DOMESTIC INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. EXPORTS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ARE ESTIMATED TO BE OVER $650 MILLION, MORE THAN THE TOTAL FOR BOTH THE FORMER EAST AND WEST WINGS DURING THE LAST NORMAL YEAR PRIOR TO THEIR SEPARATION.</item>

                            <item>THE UNITED STATES HAS EXTENDED OVER $300 MILLION IN NEW ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 1972, AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES AND MOST MEMBERS OF THE AID CONSORTIUM HAVE ALSO EXTENDED SUBSTANTAIL AID. THREE-QUARTERS OF PAKISTAN'S 1972-73 DEVELOPMENT PLAN IS FINANCED BY FOREIGN AID. MEANWHILE, MP PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN DIVIDING THE RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND BANGLADESH FOR THE LARGE EXTERNAL DEBT ASSUMED BEFORE SEPARATION. THE GOP HAS DECLARED THAT AFTER JUNE 30, 1973, IT WILL NO LONGER SERVICE THE PORTION OF THE EXTERNAL DEBT WHICH IT CONSIDERS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BANGLADESH. ALL CREDITOR CONSORTIUM MEMBERS HAVE RECENTLY PLEDGES FOR ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE IN BOTH PAKISTAN AND BANGLADESH CONDITIONAL UPON PROGRESS IN RESOLVING RESPONSIBILITYFOR THE EXTERNAL DEBT.</item>

IT INCLUDES AUTHORIZATION TO IMPOSE QUOTAS AND TARIFFS AS THESE ARE <pb n="5" xml:id="d124-05" facs="d124-05"/>NECESSARY IF WE ARE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE REDUCTIONS. US ECONOMIC POSITION HAD GREATLY CHANGED SINCE POST WORLD WAR II PERIOD. US HAD TRADE DEFICIT LAST YEAR OF SIX AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THIS WAS CAUSED BY OVER-VALUATION OF DOLLAR AND TRADE BARRIERS SUCH AS THOSE WHICH EXIST IN JAPAN AND EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. THE PRESIDENT OBJECTIVE IS TO REMOVE DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS AND BRING ABOUT FREE FLOW OF TRADE.

CAMBODIA CEASEFIRE OFFER HAD NOT BEEN ACCEPTED. CEASEFIRE WAS NOT BEING COMPLETELY IMPLEMENTED IN LAOS. IT IS, HOWEVER, ENCOURAGING THAT RUSSIA AND CHINA SEEMED TO BELIEVE IT NOT IN THEIR INTEREST TO CONTINUE WAR. IN SOUTH VIETNAM, POLAND AND HUNGARY WERE NOT COOPERATING IN ICCS. WE HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM ABOUT THIS. SHOOTING DOWN OF HELICOPTER WAS MOST UNFORTUNATE. WE FEEL NONETHELESS THAT THE ODDS ARE IN FAVOR OF CEASEFIRE. IT UNDERSTANDABLE THAT AT TIME OF CEASE-FIRE IN PLACE EACH SIDE WOULD TRY IMPROVE ITS POSITIONS. INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN DECREASING OF COURSE, ALL US TROOPS HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN.</item>

NOTED GOOD DISCUSSION HE HAD HAD WITH Minister <persName corresp="#p_AA8">Ahmed</persName> THAT MORNING BUT SAID HE WOULD ALSO VALUE REVIEW FROM PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> OF SITUATION IN AREA.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> RESPONDED WITH DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EVOLUTION HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MUJIB SINCE ASSUMING THE PRESIDENCY IN DECEMBER 1971. GIST WAS THAT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAD MADE REPEATED EFFORTS THROUGHOUT PERIOD SINCE THAT TIME TO ACHIEVE MEETING OR AT LEAST SOME FLEXIBILITY FROM MUJIB. RESULTS HAD BEEN NIL, HOWEVER, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> WOULD CONTINUE PRESSING FOR SOME RESPONSE FROM MUJIB BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR PAKISTAN TO FACE REALITY AND FIND WAY TO DEFUSE PROBLEMS IN AREA. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> THOUGHT THAT SOME DENT HAD BEEN MADE IN PROBLEM; HE WOULD CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS BUT IF THEY WERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MUJIB MUST ASSIST AND INDIA TOO. RECOGNITION WAS NO VICTORY FOR PAKISTAN; IT WOULD BE FOR MUJIB AND IT WOULD BE SATISFACTION FOR INDIA. PAKISTAN, HOWEVER MUST CONSIDER THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF SUCH ACTION, INCLUDING IMPLICATIONS FOR RESOLUTION OTHER PROBLEMS WITH INDIA AND PARTICULARLY KASHMIR. ON LATTER, IT WAS “NOT IN THE CARDS” THAT INDIA WOULD WALK OUT OF KASHMIR SO THAT AGAIN PAKISTAN WOULD HAVE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF A SETTLEMENT.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>THUS, SOME FLEXIBILITY FROM MUJIB WAS ESSENTIAL. INSTEAD, MUJIB CONTINUED TO HARP ON SUCH THINGS AS WAR CRIMES, TRIALS, WHICH IF PURSUED, <pb n="3" xml:id="d125-03" facs="d125-03"/>WOULD AMOUNT TO “PALM TREE JUSTICE” AND WOULD BRING POINT OF NO RETURN WITH ALL THE ADVERSE IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE IN PAKISTAN. ONLY A MONTH AGO HE HAD HAD TO QUELL AN OFFICERS' PLOT; IT WAS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT AFTER LONG MILITARY RULE IN PAKISTAN, CONCEPT OF CIVILIAN SUPREMACY WOULD BE EASILY ESTABLISHED. HOWEVER, MAJOR NEED NOW WAS TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND PREVENT ARBITRARY MILITARY RULE SINCE IF MILITARY TOOK OVER, THERE WOULD BE CIVIL WAR AND SPLITS WITHIN MILITARY ITSELF ALL RESULTING IN SITUATION THAT SOVIETS, INDIANS AND EVEN AFGHANS WOULD EXPLOIT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE, THUS, HIS REFERENCE TO POINT OF NO RETURN WAS NO IDLE TALK.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>IT WAS BECAUSE OF PAKISTAN'S DESIRE FOR RECONCILIATION THAT IT HAD RESPONDED DELIBERATELY AND POSITIVELY TO RECENT INDO-BANGLADESH DECLARATION. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> REVIEWED AT SOME LENGTH PAKISTAN'S RESPONSE, INCLUDING PARTICULARLY GOP POSITION THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MEET WITH INDIANS TO TALK AND AT LEAST IDENTIFY THE NATURE OF PROBLEMS THAT NOW PRESENTED THEMSELVES. PAKISTAN WOULD NOT BE “BOWLED OVER” BY INDIAN/BANGLADESH PRESSURES. PAK POSITION SHOULD BE SEEN AGAINST THE MAJOR PRINCIPLES PAKISTAN ESPOUSED; I.E., A READINESS TO ACCEPT REALITY OF BANGLADESH, A DESIRE TO CLOSE THE UNFORTUNATE CHAPTER OF PAST CONFRONTATION, AND A WILLINGNESS TO BUILD BRIDGES OF RECONCTLIATION WITH BOTH INDIA AND BANGLADESH. UNDER NO CONDITION, HOWEVER, COULD PAKISTAN ACCEPT INDIAN DOMINANCE OR GREAT POWER PRETENSIONS; INDIA DID NOT HAVE THE MAKINGS OF A GREAT POWER. IF INDIA WANTED TO BE GREAT IT MUST BE MODEST; THAT WAS THE WAY GREAT NATIONS WERE MADE. BUT PAKISTAN DID NOT YET SEE THIS KIND <pb n="4" xml:id="d125-04" facs="d125-04"/>OF APPROACH FROM INDIA.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>DEPSEC RESPONDED WITH REAFFIRMATION STRONG FRIENDSHIP FELT BY PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> AND PEOPLE US FOR PAKISTAN AND THEIR DESIRE TO SEE PAKISTAN MAKE PROGRESS AS FREE AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE STATE. DEPSEC EMPHASIZED THAT PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>'S GLOBAL EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE, INCLUDING HIS MAJOR INITIATIVES WITH BOTH CHINESE AND RUSSIANS, DID NOT SUGGEST IN ANY WAY THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY ILLUSIONS ABOUT OBJECTIVES OF THESE POWERS, PARTICULARLY RUSSIANS. WHAT IT MEANT WAS THAT WE BELIEVED THAT IN A PERIOD OF NEGOTIATION AND DETENTE, US AS FREE SOCIETY HAD MAJOR ADVANTAGES OVER CLOSED SOCIETIES OF COMMUNIST STATE'S AND WOULD BE STRENGTHENED IN PROCESS. THESE EFFORTS AT DETENTE WOULD ALSO NOT BE TAKEN TO DETRIMENT OUR CLOSE RELATIONS WITH FRIENDS LIKE PAKISTAN. HE HAD TOLD BOTH MUJIB AND MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> THAT US SOUGHT GOOD RELATIONS WITH THEM, AT SAME TIME AS IT REMAINED <pb n="5" xml:id="d125-05" facs="d125-05"/>GOOD FRIEND OF PAKISTAN. US HAD NO INTENTION TO STEP INTO MIDDLE OF SUBCONTINENTAL PROBLEMS BUT WOULD MAINTAIN STRONG INTEREST BECAUSE OF ITS HUMANITARIAN CONCERN AND BECAUSE TROUBLE IN SOUTH ASIA HAD POTENTIAL OF UNDERCUTING BROAD PROGRESS TO PEACE WHICH PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> SOUGHT. PAKISTAN HAD ADVANTAGE IN STRONG LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>, BOTH IN HIS EXTRAORDINARY SKILL IN GUIDING HIS COUNTRY INTERNALLY AND HIS FARSIGHTED APPROACH IN SIMLA PROCESS. PAKISTAN ALSO HAD ASSET IN FRIENDSHIP OF GOOD NEIGHBOR AND STRONG LEADER LIKE SHAH OF IRAN WHO HAD EMPHASIZED TO DEPSEC DURING HIS VISIT TO TEHRAN THAT HE WOULD DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO ASSIST IN MAINTENANCE PAKISTAN'S INTEGRITY.</item>

                            <item>PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> RESPONDED WITH EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION FOR CONSTANT USG SUPPORT, PARTICULARLY ASSISTANCE OF PAST YEAR WHICH HAD DONE MUCH TO KEEP PAKISTAN OUT OF THE WOODS. PAKISTAN WOULD NEED CONTINUING HELP IN FUTURE, INCLUDING SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHERE IT HOPED TO BUILD UP EFFECTIVE BUFFER STOCKS. IT ALSO HOPED THAT THERE WOULD BE GREATER ASSISTANCF THAN IN PAST IN PROJECT AID CATEGORY. US HAD BEEN LARGE-HEARTED AND PAKISTAN APPRECIATED THAT.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> CONCURRED IN DEPSEC'S REMARKS ABOUT STRENGTH AND VITALITY OF SHAH'S LEADERSHIP IN IRAN AND POTENTIAL OF THAT COUNTRY FOR AREA STABILITY. PAKISTAN HAD MUTUALITY OF INTERESTS WITH IRAN IN ITS APPROACH TO PROBLEMS OF AREA. SAID HE UNDERSTOOD WHY US WAS INCLINED TO “DRAW A LINE” AT EDGE OF IRAN IN TERMS ITS VITAL INTERESTS IN AREA BUT OUT OF REGARD FOR ITS BROADER INTERESTS IN AREA, HE HOPED THAT US WOULD CONSIDER DRAWING THAT LINE A BIT DEEPER. HE DID NOT THINK TO STOP SHORT OF PAKISTAN WHETHER WAS HELPFUL TO US INTERESTS; PARTICULARLY SINCE PAKISTAN WAS DETERMINED TO MOVE AHEAD ECONOMICALLY AND WOULD BE SOURCE OF GREAT STRENGTH TO US. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> COMMENTED “IN ALL HUMILITY” THAT HE FELT PERIOD OF BAD RELATIONS IN PAST BETWEEN US AND PAKISTAN PARTICULARLY BETWEEN 1962 AND 1966, HAD NOT COME AS RESULT ACTIONS OF PAKISTAN BUT PERHAPS MORE FROM MISREADING BY US OF SITUATION AREA AT THE TIME, PARTICULARLY INDIAN INTENTIONS TOWARD <pb n="6" xml:id="d125-06" facs="d125-06"/>CHINA. WHATEVER THE PAST, HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO REASON WHY US AND PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT HAVE CLOSEST OF TIES; NOT A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, SINCE THAT ERA WAS GONE, BUT RATHER ONE BASED ON MUTUAL INTEREST IN PEACE AND COMMON APPREHENSIONS REGARDING SOVIET AMBITIONS.</item>

                            <item>PAKISTAN'S APPREHENSIONS REGARDING SOVIET AMBITIONS PERSISTED DESPITE WHAT IT HAD COMMUNICATED TO SOVIETS ABOUT PAKISTAN'S GENUINE DESIRE TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. HE HAD TOLD SOVIETS THAT HE WANTED SUCH RELATIONSHIP SO LONG AS SOVIETS DID NOT SEEK TO PRESS PAKISTAN INTO DELETERIOUS ARRANGEMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, SOVIETS HAD AMBITIONS IN THE AREA WHICH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> FEARED AMOUNTED TO DESIRE TO EXERCISE HEGEMONY. THEREFORE, PAKISTAN WOULD REMAIN CHARY. PAKISTAN COULD TALK AND REASON WITH AMERICANS, AS WELL AS WITH CHINESE, BUT RUSSIAS HAD MANNER OF BULLYING AND BROWBEATING AND NO SELF-RESPFCTING NATION COULD ACCEPT THIS. THEY HAD ALSO INDULGED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO POLITICAL INSTABILITY INSIDE PAKISTAN AND <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAD WARNED SOVIET AMBASSADOR ABOUT THESE ACTIVITIES. HE HOPED THAT WORST OF THIS WAS NOW OVER.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>DEPSEC RESPONDED THAT US OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT “DRAW A LINE” OF KINDS REFERRED TO BY <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> US WAS GLOBAL POWER AND DID NOT INTEND TO WITHDRAW ITS INTERESTS FROM ANY PART OF THE WORLD. US UNDER PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> HAD ADJUSTED ITS APPROACH TO WORLD PROBLEMS, REFLECTING CHANGED WORLD SITUATION, BUT AS IT WENT INTO ERA OF NEGOTIATION IT WAS NOT DOING SO WITHOUT CAREFUL EYE ON SOVIET AMBITIONS AND CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT REGARD TO OUR INTERESTS IN CLOSE AND COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH COUNTRY LIKE PAKISTAN. US WOULD CONTINUE DOING EVERYTHING IT COULD TO CONTRIBUTE TO PAKISTAN'S OWN EFFORTS TO KEEP ITS FREEDOM AND BUILD FOR A STRONG FUTURE. FOR THE SAME REASON, US WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN AND SYMPATHETIC WITH PAKISTAN'S EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE RECONCILIATION AND PEACE IN SOUTH ASIA. PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> WOULD REMAIN FULLY MINDFUL OF THESE INTERESTS AND PARTICULARLY OF NEED TO MAINTAIN US MILITARY STRENGTH IN DEALINGS WITH RUSSIANS. OUR FRIENDS LIKE PAKISTAN COULD <pb n="7" xml:id="d125-07" facs="d125-07"/>REST ASSURED THAT US WOULD REMAIN STRONG AND WOULD REMAIN CLOSE FRIEND. PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> RESPONDED THAT THIS WAS SOURCE OF MUCH SATISFACTION TO PAKISTAN, NOW AS IT HAD BEEN IN THE PAST. PAKISTAN KNEW THAT THE US HAD NEVER USED ITS GREAT STRENGTH AGAINST PEACE AND THAT IT WOULD NOT DO SO IN FUTURE.</item>

HE CONTROLLED CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WITH ITS RESOURCES FOR REPRESSION AND REWARDS. HE REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED GREATER SKILL IN POLITICAL MANIPULATION OF MASSES AND INDIVIDUALS THAN HIS OPPONENTS. REPRESENTING GOVERNMENT IN POWER, HE WAS ALSO FAVORED BY NATIONAL MOOD WHICH HAS INCREASINGLY REFLECTED DESIRE TO RETURN IN “NORMALCY”.</item>

ITS MAIN LIABILITY IN CONSTITUTIONAL BATTLE MAY HAVE BEEN ITS INABILITY ATTRACT ANY SUPPORT FROM MASSES IN ISSUE REMOTE THEIR DAILY LIVES. EMBASSY AND CONSTITUENT POSTS BELIEVE THAT MANY AMONG EDUCATED CLASSES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN CONSTITUTION GENERALLY DISAPPROVED OF OPPOSITION TACTICS, ESPECIALLY OPPOSITION BOYCOTT OF ASSEMBLY. THEY APPARENTLY FELT THAT ANY REASONABLY DEMOCRATIC PERMANENT CONSTITUTION WAS PREFERABLE TO IMPOSED INTERIM CONSTITUTION, NO CONSTITUTION OR CONTINUAL POLITICAL ARGUING.</item>

IT HAS HELD PUBLIC MEETINGS RECENTLY IN QUETTA AND PESHAWAR WHERE UDF LEADERS ADVANCED SUCH DEMANDS AS LIFTING OF EMERGENCY AND IMMEDIATE PROMULGATION OF CONSTITUTION. WHILE UDF WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO ATTRACT SIZEABLE CROWDS, BELIEVE WHAT LITTLE STEAM UDF WAS ABLE BUILD UP OVER CONSTITUTION ISSUE HAS DISSIPATED.

PEOPLES' PARTY LIKELY TO ENTER ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN SPIRIT OF OVERKILL WHICH HAS CHARACTERIZED ITS POLITICAL ACTIONS DURING PAST YEAR. EVEN THOUGH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO EQUAL HIS 1970 ELECTION RESULTS WITHOUT RESORT TO UNDUE PRESSURE AGAINST OPPOSITION, BEHAVIOR OF HIS ADMINISTRATION SO FAR SUGGESTS ANY FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS ARE NOT LIKELY TO PROVE AS FAIR AS THOSE CONDUCTED BY YAHYA IN 1970 (WHICH ADMITTEDLY WERE UNIQUE IN PAKISTAN 'S SHORT HISTORY).</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S CURRENT POSITION IS ENVIABLE. HE BASKS IN POPULAR SATISFACTION OVER PASSAGE OF CONSTITUTION. HE HAS PROJECTED HIS FLANKS CATERING TO RELIGIOUS LEADERS ON POLITICAL RIGHT. WHILE HIS TALK OF REVOLUTION AND FOREIGN POLICY GAMBITS (E.G. RECOGNITION NORTH VIETNAM AND NORTH KOREA) ASSUAGED LEFT. HE HAS DISPOSED OF NAP AS POTENTIAL NATIONAL RIVAL BY BRANDING ITS LEADERS SECESSIONIST. WITH GOVERNMENT APPARATUS BEHIND HIM AND HIS PERSONAL POPULARITY STILL STRONG, HE SHOULD GARNER SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY IN PUNJAB AND SIND IN ANY ELECTIONS HELD OVER NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. POSSIBLY MORE WORRISOME TO <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> THAN OPPOSITION MAY BE CONFLICTS WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY DURING ELECTION.

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S PARTICULAR REASON IN WANTING TO TALK TO ME VERY SHORTLY AFTER MY RETURN FROM BRIEF LEAVE IN INDIA BECAME APPARENT EARLY IN OUR CONVERSATION AT NATHIAGALI JUNE 3 (REFTEL). HE CAME RIGHT OUT AND SAID HE WOULD LIKE MY HELP IN FINDING SOLUTION TO THE TROUBLED POLITICAL PROBLEM IN BALUCHISTAN. IN SHORT, HE WANTED ME TO APPROACH EX-GOVERNOR <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> WITH A PROPOSAL <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAD TO OFFER.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>AFTER RECOUNTING HIS NEGOTIATION WITH <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> AND MENGAL LAST MAY AND DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THEN (REFTEL), <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SAID HE WAS NOT ANXIOUS TO WORK BACK TOWARD THE UNDERSTANDING DISCUSSED IN MAY BUT THAT HE WAS INHIBITED IN RESUMING DIRECT ROLES AGAIN AT THIS MOMENT. BASICALLY, HIS INHIBITION CAME FROM SENSITIVITY OF CERTAIN OF HIS OWN SUPPORTERS, PARTICULARLY BALUCH GOVERNOR BUGTI AND CHIEF MINISTER JAM SAHIB <pb n="2" xml:id="d128-02" facs="d128-02"/>OF LASBELA. THEY WERE DEAD SET AGAINST FURTHER PRESIDENTIAL NEGOTIATIONS (WHICH COULD NOT BE KEPT SECRET) PRIOR TO OR DURING FORTHCOMING PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY SESSION NOW SCHEDULED TO BEGIN JUNE 22. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> FELT SIMILARLY INHIBITED FROM CALLING ON HIS SPECIAL ASSISTANT, RAFI RAZA, TO DO THE JOB FOR HIM BECAUSE THAT TOO WOULD BE EASILY TRACED TO THE PRESIDENT.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> THEN REFERRED TO WHAT HE TERMED MY HELP IN GETTING UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF CONSTITUTION LAST APRIL, ESPECIALLY MY TALK WITH <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> AT THAT TIME. (SEE MY LETTER OF MAY 16 TO AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MAH1">MEYER</persName> ON THIS SUBJECT.) HE ADDED THAT HE KNEW ME AS A GOOD FRIEND OF PAKISTAN AND ALSO A GOOD FRIEND OF <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName>. THAT WAS WHY HE WAS ASKING ME TO HELP ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION. HE THEN SPELLED OUT THE MESSAGE HE HOPED I WOULD PASS TO <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> (SEE PARA 7 BELOW).</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I SAID I WAS TAKEN ABACK BY <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S SUGGESTION. I WAS PLEASED THAT HE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN ME AND MY ABILITY TO CARRY OUT WHAT WOULD BE A DELICATE EXERCISE. HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT THE TYPE OF THING IN WHICH DIPLOMATS — EVEN FRIENDLY DIPLOMATS — RAN INTO AS A NORMAL PART OF THEIR DUTIES. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY REQUEST. HE HAD DONE SO BECAUSE OUR RELATIONSHIP HAD ALWAYS BEEN FRANK AS WELL AS FRIENDLY, HE RECALLED THAT IN 1971 I HAD COME TO HIM WITH A REQUEST FOR HELP AND HE HAD IMMEDIATELY OBLIGED (REFERENCE WAS TO MY APPEAL THAT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> USE HIS INFLUENCE TO CALL OFF PPP SPOKESMEN AND PRESS WHO HAD BEEN ATTACKING AMBASSADOR FARLAND).</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>YOU WILL APPRECIATE THAT I FELT VERY MUCH ON THE SPOT. I FELT I SHOULD MAKE A DECISION THERE AND THEN RATHER THAN FUDGE. TO SAY “NO, THANKS” WOULD HAVE BEEN DIPLOMATICALLY IMPECCABLE BUT WOULD SURELY HAVE REDUCED VERY SHARPLY WHATEVER VALUE I STILL HAVE HERE AS SENIOR US REP. MORE THAN THAT, IT SEEMED TO ME THAT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTOS</persName> PROPOSAL WAS REASONABLY HONORABLE (ALTHOUGH IT HAS ITS FAULTS) AND, IF IT PROVES TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO NAP, COULD <pb n="3" xml:id="d128-03" facs="d128-03"/>LEAD TO AN IMPORTANT ABATEMENT OF WHAT IS PERHAPS PAKISTAN'S MOST URGENT POLITICAL PROBLEM OF TODAY. I THEREFORE TOLD <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> THAT I WOULD UNDERTAKE TO REACH <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> AND CONVEY <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S MESSAGE TO HIM. WE AGREED CATEGORICALLY THAT I SHOULD UNDERTAKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO PASS THE MESSAGE TO <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> AND TO RELAY TO <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> ANY MESSAGE WHICH <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> MIGHT WISH TO SEND THROUGH ME. I SAID I WOULD MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS I COULD TO <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> THAT MY AGREEMENT TO PLAYING THIS ROLE REFLECTED NOTHING MORE THAN MY INTEREST AND HOPE THAT THE VARIOUS CONCERNED ELEMENTS WOULD FIND A WAY TO RESOLVE A TROUBLESOME PROBLEM; ALSO THAT I WAS ACTING IN A PURELY, PERSONAL CAPACITY AS A FRIEND, AND NOTHING MORE; I WOULD NOT VOICE ANY STAND PRO OR CON.</item>

                            <item>I THEREUPON ADDED THAT I WAS WILLING TO TAKE ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY ASSIGNMENT BECAUSE OF MY RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> AND FOR HIS EFFORTS TO EVOLVE A REASONABLE CONSENSUS ON ONE OF THE MOST URGENT PROBLEMS FACING HIS COUNTRY.

                                    <item>PRESIDENT HAD REFERRED, DURING RECENT PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH ME, TO TALKS HE HAD HAD WITH <persName corresp="#p_BMGB1">BIZENJO</persName> AND MENGAL ABOUT ESTABLISHMENT OF AN NAP/JUI/PPP COALITION <pb n="4" xml:id="d128-04" facs="d128-04"/>IN BALUCHISTAN.

                                    <item>SINCE THOSE TALKS, SITUATION HAD BECOME COMPLICATED BY KILLING OF DIR SCOUTS AND INCREASE IN MENGAL VIOLENT ACTIVITY IN <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">JHA LAWAN</persName> AREA; SENSITIVITY BY GOVERNOR BUGTI AND CHIEF MINISTER JAM SAHIB OF LASBELA TO FURTHER DIRECT MEETINGS BY PRESIDENT IN PERIOD AROUND PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY SESSION; AND INCREASE BY CERTAIN NAP ELEMENTS OF ANTI-IRAN AND ANTI-SHAH STATEMENTS.</item>
                                    <label>(C)</label>
                                    <item>PRESIDENT IS PREPARED TO CARRY THROUGH ON UNDERSTANDING REACHED LAST MAY, SHORTLY AFTER FORTHCOMING BUDGET SESSION OF PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY.

                                    <item>PRESIDENT WOULD THEN APPOINT GOVERNOR OF PRESIDENT'S OWN CHOICE, BUT SOMEONE WITH WHOM NAP WOULD BE HAPPY.

                                    <item>AS PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY MADE CLEAR, IT IS HIS INTENTION TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN BALUCHISTAN.</item>
                                    <label>(I)</label>
                                    <item>PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE NAP NOT TO OPPOSE MAINTENANCE OF PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN QUETTA UNTIL ABOVE ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN WORKED OUT. THIS COULD BE DONE, FOR EXAMPLE, BY ABSTENTION OF NAP MEMBERS FROM VOTE OF CONFIDENCE ON CURRENT GOVERNMENT WHEN PROVINCIAL, ASSEMBLY MEETS LATER THIS MONTH OR IT COULD BE DONE IN ANY OTHER WAY THAT NAP WOULD PREFER, SUCH AS ARRANGING THAT NAP MEMBERS OF PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY WOULD NOT BE PRESENT WHEN CONFIDENCE VOTE TAKEN.</item>

                            <item>FINAL ITEM IN PARA 7 ABOVE MAY PRESENT TOUGHEST PROBLEM FOR NAP, IF IT IS WILLING TO ACCEPT OTHER POINTS OF <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S PROPOSAL.

NEVERTHELESS REQUEST EMBASSY MAKE SERIOUS EFFORT OBTAIN GOP AGREEMENT TO TOTAL SETTLED AREA BAN THIS CROP YEAR AND REPORT OUTCOME BEFORE FALLING BACK ON ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL. SHOULD FALLBACK POSITION BECOME NECESSARY, WE FAR PREFER ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL OF EMBASSY, I.E., THAT TWO YEAR PHASE-OUT BE DONE GEOGRAPHICALLY RATHER THAN ORAKZAI FORMULA WHICH SEEMS A BIT DISINGENUOUS. IF GOP COULD CONTROL ILLICIT OUTPUT OF SETTLED AREAS, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR TOTAL BAN ON PRODUCTION. PROBLEM HAS BEEN AND NO DOUBT CONTINUES TO BE THAT ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES IN PLACE CAN'T AND/OR WON'T DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN AN ILLICIT POPPY AND A LICIT ONE WHEN BOTH GROWN SIDE BY SIDE.</item>

WHILE FIGURE OF 6,000 ACRES AND 75 MT IS WITHIN RANGE OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ESTIMATING FOR SETTLED AREAS, ACREAGE AND ESTIMATED TONNAGE (160 TO 200 MT) FOR MERGED AND TRIBAL TERRITORIES IS FAR HIGHER THAN ANYTHING WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SEEN. NCB HAS INDICATED WE WILL SHORTLY BE PROVIDED WITH BREAKDOWN OF PRODUCTION ESTIMATES BY AREA.

CHARGE REGRETTED ISLAM'S INTERPRETATION OF NOTE, EMPHASIZING LACK OF INTENT TO DICTATE ANYTHING AND THAT IT WAS NOT “TAKE-IT-OR-LEAVE-IT” PROPOSAL. HE REVIEWED EARLIER USG EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE GOP PRODUCTION PLANNING, AND URGED FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF USG PROPOSAL AND POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES. WHILE INDICATING THAT GOP WOULD PROBABLY NOT COMPLETE PLANNING FOR AT LEAST TWO MONTHS, ISLAM DID NOT RULE OUT POSSIBILITY OF SOME STATEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> VISIT. GOP DECISION FOR IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF SETTLED AREA PRODUCTION IS UNLIKELY, BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT RECENT EXCHANGES WITH ISLAM WILL ENCOURAGE GOP TO REEXAMINE ITS EARLIER THREE-YEAR TIMETABLE.

MISSION NARCOTICS COORDINATOR (<persName corresp="#p_SRB2">SMITH</persName>) ACCOMPANIED, WHILE MFA DIR. GEN. ZAKI AND ORAKZAI SAT IN FOR GOP. REFERRING TO HIS MEETING WITH AMB. HANDLEY, ISLAM SAID THAT “HE HAD THROWN UP HIS HANDS IN HORROR” WHEN HE WAS SHOWN COPY OF NOTE. HE SAID THAT “WE” FOUND NOTE “VERY OBJECTIONABLE"BOTH IN TONE AND SUBSTANCE. HE STATED THAT DICTATION OF TIMETABLE FOR GOP TO ELIMINATE OPIUM PRODUCTION BY USG ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT WAS OUT OF QUESTION. REFERRING TO CHARGE'S CONVERSATION WITH ZAK WHEN NOTE HAD BEEN PRESENTED (REF C), ISLAM ALSO TOOK EXCEPTION TO ALLEGED SUGGESTION THAT PROPOSAL CONTAINED IN NOTE BE DEALT WITH BY CABINET MINISTER.</item>

                            <item>AS TO SUBSTANCE, ISLAM SAID PROPOSAL “HAD NO MEANING” BECAUSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FULFILL. DECISION TO IMPLEMENT IT WOULD BE PURELY COSMETIC. GOP WISHED “TO SOLVE PROBLEM, NOT TINKER WITH IT.” PLANNING FOR ELIMINATION OF PRODUCTION NECESSITATED CONSIDERATION OF A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING COMPENSATION, ALTERNATIVE CROPS, PROVISION OF FERTILIZER AND SEEDS, AND CONSTRUCTION OF DAMS AND ROADS. SUCH PLANNING REQUIRED THAT VIEWS OF THE AFFECTED RECEIVE CAREFUL ATTENTION. HE SAID HE HAD INDICATED AT FINAL MEETING WITH US NARCOTICS TEAM ON FEB 1 THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO PREPARE PEOPLE OF COUNTRY FOR THIS IMPORTANT STEP. HE REMARKED THAT THIS MESSAGE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN LOST UPON TEAM DESPITE EXCEPTIONAL CALIBER OF ITS WORK. HE STATED GOP WAS IN PROCESS OF FORMULATING COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO DEAL WITH PRODUCTION PHASEOUT WHICH WOULD BE PROCESSED EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. FOR MERGED AND TRIBAL AREAS WOULD FOLLOW FROM PLANS FOR SETTLED AREAS AND WOULD HAVE TO BE DRAWN UP WITH GREAT CAUTION. QUESTION OF COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF INCOME AND REVENUE FROM OPIUM PRODUCTION HAD NOT YET BEEN FULLLY ADDRESSED, BUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE INDIVIDUAL FARMERS AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS, AND TO FUND NEW FACILITIES AND INFRASTRCTURE PROJECTS IN NWFP. GOP WELCOMED VISIT OF <pb n="3" xml:id="d135-03" facs="d135-03"/>QUENTIN WEST AND HAD INVITED UN TEAM TO COME PROMPTLY TO STUDY PRODUCTION PROBLEM. GOP PLANNING WOULD BENEFIT FROM BOTH THESE INPUTS.

US TEAM HAD PROPOSED FOUR, WHICH WAS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE. NCB WAS NOT PROPOSING TO BEGIN WITH 25 FIELD INVESTIGATIVE UNITS (FIU'S). ISLAM NOTED THAT EARLIER NCB LIST OF EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS PASSED TO EMBASSY HAD INCLUDED 75 REVOLVERS, 15 RIFLES AND 50 STUN GUNS. ISLAM CLAIMED HE HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT AN EMBASSY OFFICER HAD TOLD NCB THAT PROVISION OF SUCH WEAPONS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A “THREAT TO SECURITY OF INDIA “ WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS ABSURD.</item>

GOP HAD ACTED ALMOST OVERNIGHT TO SHIFT NARCOTICS FROM REVENUE TO ENFORCEMENT MATTER. ORAKZAI'S ACHIEVEMENT IN PULLING TOGETHER NCB, OBTAINING COOPERATION OF ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND IN DEVELOPING WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH US AND UN AGENCIES WAS OUTSTANDING. HE DOUBTED THAT ANY OTHER GOVERNENT COULD HAVE DONE TO MUCH. HE EXPRESSED FEAR THAT US NOTE WOULD BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. THE GOP WOULD CONTINUE TO COOPERATE IN THIS AREA.</item>

IT FOLLOWED SEVERAL EXCHANGES WITH GOP OFFICIALS IN WHICH VIEWS OF BOTH SIDES WERE EXPLORED. HE GREATLY REGRETTED THAT ISLAM CONSIDERED TONE AND CONTENT OBJECTIONABLE. INTENT OF NOTE WAS TO STIMULATE MUTUALLY AGREEABLE DECISION WITHIN CONTEXT OF EXISTING CLOSE, COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOTH GOVERNMENTS. CHARGE REJECTED CATEGORICALLY IDEA THAT NOTE IMPLIED USG DESIRE TO DICTATE TO GOP, POINTING OUT THAT SUCH AN APPROACH WAS NOT IN NATURE OF USG RELATIONSHIP WITH GOP. CHARGE NOTED THAT IN HIS YEARS IN PAKISTAN HE HAD RECEIVED A LARGE NUMBER OF GOP REQUESTS FOR USG ASSISTANCE ON OTHER ACTION, SOME VERY INSISTENT BUT HAD CONSIDERED THEM AS REFLECTIVE OF GOP INTENT TO DICTATE WHAT US DECISION SHOULD BE. USG WAS FULLY COGNIZANT THAT DECISION ON TIMETABLE FOR ELIMINATING POPPY PRODUCTION HAD BROAD RAMIFICATIONS AND WAS ENTIRELY WITHIN SOVEREIGN JURISDICTION OF PAKISTAN. CHARGE SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENTS COULD CONTINUE TO BE FRANK AND FRIENDLY. IT HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED THAT RECENT US PROPOSAL WOULD BE SEEN IN THAT LIGHT. AS ISLAM KNEW, AMERICAN PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT INTERNATIONAL ILLICIT FLOW OF NARCOTICS AND THAT EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THIS FLOW WAS MATTER OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO US. CHARGE'S SUGGESTION THAT GOP DECISION WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE GIVEN AT HIGH POLITICAL LEVEL WAS MADE SIMPLY IN RECOGNITION <pb n="5" xml:id="d135-05" facs="d135-05"/>OF ITS IMPORTANT POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL, IMPLICATIONS. CHARGE HAD ACTUALLY DISCUSSED NARCOTICS ISSUE WITH PRES. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> ON NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. CHARGE SAID THAT HE HOPED ISLAM WOULD NOT READ MORE INTO SUGGESTION THAT GOP DECISION WOULD HAVE TO BE AT POLITICAL LEVEL.</item>

                            <item>WITH REGARD TO SPECIFICS OF PROPOSAL, CHARGE POINTED OUT THAT EMBASSY REPS HAD BEEN DISCUSSING ELIMINATION OF PRODUCTION WITH GOP REPS FOR ALMOST A YEAR. THERE HAD BEEN INDICATIONS THAT GOP WAS PREPARED TO REDUCE OPIUM PRODUCTION LAST SEASON BY 15 PERCENT, BUT LICENSED PRODUCTION HAD INSTEAD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED. MISSION REPS HAD ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS SUGGESTED THAT GOP ENTER INTO DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH USAID REPS ON PLANS FOR ELIMINATING PRODUCTION, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE CROPS AND RURAL UPLIFT PROGRAM IN POPPY ZONE. THESE SUGGESTIONS HAD NOT BEEN PICKED UP BY GOP. IN FACT, CHARGE HAD BEEN NO GOP RESPONSE UNTIL HELPFUL DOCUMENT WHICH ISLAM HAD FORWARDED UNDER COVER OF HIS JUNE 13 LETTER (REF B). PROPOSAL FOR IMMEDIATE ELIMINATION OF SETTLED PRODUCTION HAD COME FROM TEAM AND REPRESENTED ITS BEST JUDGMENT ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. EMBASSY NOTE REFLECTED USG CONCERN ABOUT TIMELINESS OF GOP STEPS TO ERADICATE PRODUCTION AND FEAR THAT PROBLEM, IF NOT FIRMLY ADDRESSED IN NEAR FUTURE, WOULD BECOME EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE. CHARGE “STATED THAT THIS WAS NOT “TAKE-IT-OR-LEAVE-IT” PROPOSAL, BUT WAS OFFERED IN THE HOPE THAT MOST RAPID FEASIBLE TIMETABLE AGREEABLE ON BOTH SIDES COULD BE WORKED OUT. HE ENCOURAGED ISLAM TO GIVE FURTHER CONSIDERATION TO US PROPOSAL IN THIS LIGHT.</item>

HE SAID THAT GOP WOULD PROCEED WITH ITS PLANNING, UTILIZING VISITS BY QUENTIN WEST AND UN TEAM. CHARGE MENTIONED THAT EMBASSY HAD EXPRESSED HOPE THAT COULD BE MADE IN CONJUNCTION OF <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> VISIT BUT IN EFFORT TO PRESSURE GOP BUT IN HOPE OF CONTRIBUTING TO SUCCESS OF VISIT. ISLAM SAID THAT WHILE HE COULD NOT PREDICT EXACT TIME WHEN GOP PLANNING WOULD BE COMPLETED, HE ANTICIPATED THAT GOP WOULD BE READY IN COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THEN WOULD INFORM EMBASSY. CHARGE RESPONDED THAT WE HAD HOPED FOR SOME MORE PRECISE ANSWER THAN PROMISE OF FURTHER PLANNING AND DISCUSSIONS AT LATER DATE. HE ASKED IF ISLAM MEANT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO STATEMENT ON NARCOTICS IN CONNECTION WITH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> VISIT. ISLAM SAID HE DID NOT KNOW, ALTHOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT NARCOTICS WOULD PROBABLY BE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IN WASHINGTON. ISLAM CLOSED MEETING WITH STATEMENT THAT GOP DESIRED TO CONTINUE COOPERATION WITH USG IN NARCOTICS FIELD IN “MOST MEANINGFUL WAY.” HE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT THESE EFFORTS WOULD MEET WITH SUCCESS.</item>

                            <item>COMMENT. IN CARRYING OUT INSTRUCTIONS FOR FORMAL PROPOSAL OF GOP, WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH REACTION WHICH IS NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISING. WITH RESPECT TO TEAM RECCOMENDATIONS, ISLAM HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED (RATHER GRATUITOUSLY) THAT GOP WOULD GIVE THEM FULL CONSIDERATION BUT THAT IT WOULD MAKE DECISIONS ITSELF ABOUT WHAT TO DO. HE IS SENSITIVE TO ANY INTIMATION THAT GOP EFFORT, FOR WHICH HE HAS BEEN GIVEN SUPERVISING RESPONSIBILITY BY <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>, IS LESS VIGOROUS OR POSITIVE THAN IT SHOULD BE. ATTITUDE REFLECTED IN HIS REMARRK TO AMB. HANDLEY REFTEL THAT NOTE WOULD “END DIALOGUE” WAS HASTY AND ILL-CONSIDERED; IT HAS, WE BELIEVE, ALREADY BEEN MODIFIED BY HIS STATEMENTS TO US. HAVING GOTTEN OFF HIS CHEST WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY AND HAVING HEARD OUR EXPLANATION AND RESPONSE, WE BELIEVE ISLAM WILL NOW TURN BACK—EVEN MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY PERHAPS—TO TASK OF WORKING OUT TIMETABLE FOR ELIMINATING PRODUCTION AND ATTENDANT ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. WE CONSIDER IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY GOP WILL GO AHEAD WITH DECISION TO CHASE OUT SETTLED AREA PRODUCTION IMMEDIATELY. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT RECENT EXCHANGES WILL STIMULATE GOP TO RE-EXAMINE NCB PHASE-OUT PLAN ANTICIPATING TWO MORE CROPS IN SETTLED AREAS (PARA 4, REF C).</item>

                        <p>SOUTH ASIA: A LOOK AHEAD</p>
                        <p>In anticipation of Pakistan President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s state visit next week, the following is a brief review of the status of negotiations in South Asia and a look ahead.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>The stage appears set for resumed negotiations between India and Pakistan on the exchange of POW and civilian detainees shortly after <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s visit to Washington. The prospects are uncertain, with the immediate question remaining that of Mujib's intentions regarding POW trials. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> must take Chinese interests into consideration: whereas Moscow is not exerting appreciable influence in New Delhi or Dacca, it is clear that Peking plays a significant role in Pakistan's decisions.</p>
                        <p>For the longer term, the question of stability in South Asia will depend largely on <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s intentions toward India. Already possessing a credible military deterrent against India, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> recently has exerted public pressures for resumed military assistance from the US which suggest that he is investigating the option of a <pb n="2" xml:id="d136-02" facs="d136-02"/>renewed confrontation. His assessment of the US response to his approach will have an important influence on his future relations with India.</p>

                        <p>As of today, 18 months since the end of the war and just one year since the Simla Agreements, the only progress toward a resolution of the problems resulting from the 1971 crisis has been the withdrawal of Indian and Pakistani troops along the international border and the delineation of a new line of control in Kashmir. However, the stage has lately been at least partially set for a new phase in negotiations to deal with the exchange of POW and civilian detainees. A satisfactory exchange would pave the way for further progress on such matters as:

                                <item>— the exchange of diplomatic representatives (including Pakistan 's recognition of Bangladesh );</item>
                                <item>— negotiations over the division of assets and liabilities between Pakistan and Bangladesh ;</item>
                                <item>— normalization of relations between India and Pakistan, including overflights, transit, and trade.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The question of establishing a new modus vivendi among the three South Asian powers, including some however, remains well over the horizon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Preparations for Next Phase</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Islamabad and New Delhi have tentatively agreed to resume talks following <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s return from the US; the date and venue have not yet been determined. All three governments have indicated that they would like to reach an agreement over the exchange of detainees. India and Bangladesh demonstrated their interest with their April 17 proposal, which was followed by a series of high-level Indian-Bangalee negotiations over a joint response to Pakistan's subsequent counterproposals. Pakistan demonstrated its interest via a series of private letters to Indian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName> which indicated more flexibility toward the proposal than Pakistan 's public position do including hints of flexibility over the war trials and Bihari issues.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Prospects Uncertain</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet the prospects for the next phase of negotiations are highly uncertain. It appears possible that an agreement can be reached over a swap of most of the POW's in India for the Bangalees in Pakistan, that the Bihari question may be negotiable, and that Bangladesh and India may agree to address the Bihari repatriation question as a separate issue.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d136-04" facs="d136-04"/>
                        <p>Less certain are Mujib's intentions regarding war crimes trials and <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s level of tolerance for such trials. Despite clear signs of Indian efforts to persuade Mujib to limit — if not forego the trials, no information on Mujib's intentions is available; and although Bangladesh has not yet published the names of the prisoners to be tried, or the charges, and has not yet introduced enabling legislation to permit the trials, the Dacca authorities claim to have documentary evidence directly linking senior Pakistani Generals Niazi and Farman Ali to the terrorist squads which murdered large numbers of Bangladesh's civilian elite during the last days before the surrender. Thus it appears that Mujib has not yet made any final decisions on the nature and scope of the trials to be held.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s position is equally obscure. Although he has repeatedly stated that any trials would foreclose the prospects for normalization of Pakistan 's relations with India and Bangladesh, he has also indicated a potential tolerance for limited trials. On July 10 he put through the National Assembly a resolution approving recognition of Bangladesh at an appropriate time without specific conditions regarding the trials <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is clearly keeping his options open.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Balance of Outside Influence</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite the close association between India and the Soviet Union since the signing of the Indo-Soviet treaty and the subsequent. crisis, there is no evidence that Moscow is exerting appreciable influence on foreign policy decisions. Rather, there is ample evidence—such as the Indian restrictions on the Soviet cultural centers last year and a number of subsequent Indian positions at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> — that India has ignored strong Soviet pressures for support, even on issues of limited interest to India, and has been decidedly unhelpful to Moscow. To Soviet chagrin, moreover, Indian spokesmen — notably Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> herself — have repeatedly included Moscow in warnings against superpower agreements detrimental to smaller powers, and have told the Soviets, as they have told us, not to become involved in South Asian disputes.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, there are signs that Pakistan 's China alliance has a significant influence on Pakistan 's foreign policy decisions. Peking's posture on the question of Bangladesh's <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership evidently had a strong influence in breaking Islamabad's moves toward recognition of Dacca last summer; <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s recognition of the Sihanouk government-in-exile can only have been the result of Pakistani sensitivity to Chinese interests; and there can be no doubt that Pakistan's and Iran's new alliance and joint allegations of Soviet mischief open new areas for China in its competition with the Soviet Union.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s Intentions</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>While Mujib's intentions regarding trials are the key to the prospects for a more stable situation in South Asia for the immediate future, the long-term prospects for stability depend primarily on <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s intentions toward India. Here the picture is not promising. In the past 18 months, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has avoided a posture of confrontation with India, but has also ruled out conciliation and has thus far successfully fended off Indian and Bengalee proposals for a normalization of relations. Moreover, he has kept alive the option for a future resumption of the confrontation with India.</p>
                        <p>In the summer of 1972, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> was reported to have said privately that he intended to reorganize and rearm Pakistan to preserve the option of reviving the confrontation with India in the future. At this point, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> may have been attempting to reassure his government that there had been no sellout at Simla. In his July 6 interview with American Journalists, however, in which he demanded military “parity” with India and spoke of potential military superiority over India, he was not speaking to a domestic audience. In contrast to his private assurances to us that he recognizes the unalterable power balance in South Asia and hopes to reduce Pakistan's defense expenditures, the 1973-74 budget introduced last month provided for the same high level of defense expenditures as last year's budget ($451 million).</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Pakistan 's Military Expansion</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the last 18 months, Pakistan's military capability has not only been fully restored to that existing on the eve of the 1971 war but has actually been improved in some areas, notably air defense and ground forces. since the war, Pakistan has improved its ratio of ground forces vis-à-vis India from 1:4 to 1:2.7 (i.e., from 284,000 to 400,000 men), not including some 56,000 POW's still in India. Pakistan already matches India in armor and has maintained the same ratio in artillery as in manpower. Whereas India has a clear edge in number of aircraft, Pakistan 's receipts of 60 new MIG-19's from China and its French Mirages have provided a substantial improvement in Pakistan 's air defense. More significant, the Chinese TU-16's now available to Pakistan in case of conflict would make important Indian military and industrial targets vulnerable to air attack for the first time. While still vulnerable to naval blockade, Pakistan already has a formidable defense capability sufficient to constitute a credible deterrent against Indian attack. In case of actual hostilities, moreover, Pakistan could expect substantial support from Middle Eastern countries, particularly in air defense.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Given Pakistan 's present military capabilities and <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s continuing search for substantial new arms supplies, particularly from the US, it seems clear that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> will determine what posture to adopt toward India in the light of the outcome of his Washington visit. In addition to a general reaffirmation of US support, he appears determined to seek a specific and public affirmation of a US security commitment to Pakistan which would in effect apply to any conflict against India, and which would hopefully lead to a resumption of substantial deliveries of lethal arms. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s assessment of the US response to his approach will have an important influence on his intentions toward India and thus on future developments in South Asia.</p>

                            </hi>: When Braden comes back I don't want to see one unfriendly article about Me! <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> was diabolical. I could always tell where he had had dinner.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: I am not diabolical and neither is Tom. All I have said about our last meeting is that it was a friendly talk and we both expressed our desire for progress in our relations.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Of course. I can only say it is fortunate for us that you are here in a period of improving relations, because I think you would be a formidable opponent. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: I want to congratulate you on the agreement with the Soviets. It is an improvement on the Shanghai Communique, from our point of view. You cleverly skirted some issues.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, and on the Mideast. The phrase about “the legitimate interests of the Palestinians” is an improvement. Could you tell me if South Asia and the Gulf were discussed? I saw Joe <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> but he couldn't tell me. I got some inkling from Dobrynin. I will be frank with you. He shed more light than <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>.</p>

                            </hi>: What is the conflict in the Gulf area that we should have referred to?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: There is talk in the press about India sending secret advisers to Iraq, and competing with Iran in the area. Also, in India itself, there is the apprehension about the U.S. arms to Iran going to Pakistan. Particularly the Phantoms.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We would not put it in the Communique with the Soviet Union!</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Also, there is our concern with the Gulf generally. The Shah/<persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> meetings, and Zahedi's speech at Georgetown. If Iran attacks Pakistan, Iran will act. The Shah said that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GE3">Gonsalves</persName>
                            </hi>: But Zahedi was stronger.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: But you won't attack Pakistan, so it is all irrelevant.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Those are our concerns. Iran wants to dominate the Gulf. It has made no secret of it. Its arming should be commensurate with its needs. Phantoms have a range of 1,500 miles. If Iran's threat is from Iraq, Phantoms are not necessary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: First, on the summit. Obviously this sort of problem was not discussed. There was a general review of the situation, including South Asia, in which — it is fair to say — both sides indicated they would act with some restraint and not feel we are in mortal conflict with one another and have to line up countries against each other there. On specific issues, my impression is we both use our influence in a pacifying way. But there was no concrete discussion on, for example, how to handle the prisoner issue, etcetera. Our view we have told you without any insistence. We don't think the Soviet Union is competent to deal with your problem, therefore we don't feel we should make an agreement with the Soviet Union about matters that concern you. <pb n="3" xml:id="d137-03" facs="d137-03"/>There was no discussion of the Gulf area at all. There was an extensive discussion of the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: There was no discussion of the joint offer of April 17 of India and Bangladesh?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: There was some discussion between Gromyko and me about the need for restraint in arming the Gulf states — but not Iran. Oman, for example.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: How is China taking it, if I may ask?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I think it was in less than complete accord with us. It is a wrong conception on their part — because if we want a condominium with the Soviet Union we can do it on specific issues and we don't need agreement of this kind. We have the experience that whenever we meet with one, the other is worried.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: As the third would be if the other two met. Why are the Europeans all upset about it? I read in the Washington Post today that they are upset about the Brezhnev visit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: First of all, the Post has a vested interest in dismantling our foreign policy now that they have done it to our domestic policy. I happen to know Davignon's views are not what the Post said they are. Mr. Ambassador, you will have to separate what you see in the eastern press - we have been through this before. Though this is more acute.</p>
                        <p>On the Europeans — you know from your experience — and you are less and less dependent — that when you have been in a period of dependence, even if you have confidence in the current leadership you can't count on it forever. And you are in an undignified position. So there is an endemic insecurity. Secondly, there is a bureaucracy with vested interests in thinking up things that could go wrong. Third, there is the objective problem of the new military balance. It is a different situation with 1,500 Soviet missiles then when there were 50.</p>
                        <p>You read the agreement. You are a diplomat. It is an extremely subtle document. There is both more and less than meets the eye. It refers to <pb n="4" xml:id="d137-04" facs="d137-04"/>“their policies,” not “their policy.” Then there is the organic link with overall restraint and conventional war. It applies to diplomacy before a war, not to the conduct of war. But fevered minds in Europe have figured out that there could be a consultation after a conventional war starts but before a resort to nuclear weapons. The point of the document is that it is necessary that there be restraint. It is essentially about restraint in peacetime.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: We will probably have another talk on that, because I have other points to raise.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>

                            </hi>: The press asked me. I said it is a good thing, it relaxes international tensions, it is reassuring to other countries. It cannot be seen as an attempt to divide the world into two camps, because that theory is out of date.</p>

                        <p>

                            </hi>: [To <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Saunders</persName>] Get the worldwide numbers, the other commitments and see what the possibility is of juggling it from here.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: My understanding is that you have 12 million. If you can't give 4.5 million, we would like at least 4, and we can get 500,000 from Canada.</p>
                        <p>On development assistance, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said no decision was possible until we know more about our whole economic relationship. I quoted to him about <pb n="7" xml:id="d137-07" facs="d137-07"/>the President's step-by-step approach. I said the rupee matter is the first step. I told him, whatever the amount, the sooner the decision the better, because it is holding up our five-year plan.</p>
                        <p>I am glad you are changing the name of A.I.D. “Cooperation” is better. We had an aid mission in Nepal and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> changed the name. She said it's not aid but cooperation.</p>
                        <p>I am taking your advice and seeing many House committee members.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes. It is important.</p>
                        <p>Frankly, I think it is moving — maybe not as fast as you want — but our intentions are positive.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: I want to leave with you an idea about the Gulf area. There could be some understanding with you and the Soviet Union and Iran and Pakistan for guaranteeing the stability of the area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: What would be the practical content of the agreement?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Like Indochina, the two superpowers and the others would guarantee the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the area, meet together if there is trouble, and agree not to provide arms.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Have you talked to the Soviet Union about this?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: I haven't even spoken to our government yet. I wanted your views first. I did mention it to Dobrynin in a rough way. But I have taken it no further yet until I hear your opinion.</p>

                            </hi>: I will think about it. It moves in a direction to which we are sympathetic — to keep the area stable and keep it from exploding. It depends on who is defined as a Gulf state. Do you mind if we discuss it with the Shah? Not as your idea.</p>
                        <p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: What do you think about what he is doing? There are two possibilities: He means it, or he is puffing himself up for a negotiation.</p>

                            </hi>: I do too. He hasn't too many places to go.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>

                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I would like to know the probable outcome, the framework of the negotiation. We have talked to every other group in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>First, Cambodia shouldn't be settled by the United States but by the Cambodians primarily. While they all say they want to talk to me, I don't want to do more than the framework negotiation, not the details.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Sihanouk talked to our Embassy — I have the impression he talks big publicly but might be willing to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: What is his power? Can he deliver?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: He has a popular following in Cambodia. He seems resigned to be only a titular head. But when he returns he may be tempted to do more. He may try to change the balance of forces if he can.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: On the Shah's visit, we see no conflict of interest. We share the desire to see stability in Pakistan and no dismemberment. There should be understanding on this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: You would be prepared to have an understanding on this? I was impressed with what you said at the lunch. Because many of your concerns about transfers would become academic in that context. We would be prepared to help this.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: You should discuss it [i.e., the question of an appointment with the Shah] with their Ambassador. I will mention the idea to the Shah.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: I know the Ambassador. He is a little too outspoken, and leaves too little negotiating flexibility in his talks. I could discuss the appointment with him, but he is not the best person to discuss the idea with.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: There is a great possibility of economic cooperation between Iran and US. We have a joint refinery at Madras. There is the possibility of transporting it through Pakistan. Why not? Pakistan is suffering from all this. If he could also help Pakistan consider the joint offer that we and Bangladesh made with great difficulty…</p>

                        <p>After a hiatus of 13 years, Pakistan again has a civilian government that allows for an organized opposition. In this new situation, President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and opposition leaders have had to work out their respective roles in the governmental process. This paper examines the major issues they have had to confront, the procedures that have evolved in dealing with these problems, and the implications of this system for the short- and long-term stability of Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>Since the restoration of civilian government, the political since process in Pakistan has been characterized by a continual succession of crises. President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is anxious to maintain all political power in his own hands, but has been forced to compromise with opposition the parties because his strength is concentrated in only two of Pakistan's four provinces. Moreover, during the process of drafting and ratifying a new constitution acceptable to all of the various political elements, the confrontations have been acute and frequent.</p>
                        <p>Through complicated exchanges, President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and opposition leaders have been able to hammer out various compromises. Although lack of trust and personal antagonisms have often <pb n="2" xml:id="d138-02" facs="d138-02"/>resulted in the early collapse of these agreements, both <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and opposition leaders appear to be learning their own limitations through this process and may be developing procedures to deal with one another so as to reduce the risk of violent confrontations.</p>
                        <p>But the prospects for long-term stability in Pakistan remain uncertain. By maintaining the initiative and by using repressive measures against non-PPP (Pakistan Peoples Party) politicians and the press, President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has forced the opposition to accept compromises on his own terms. An adroit use of carrot-and-stick tactics has strengthened his position, but it has also intensified regional antagonisms. The present political process, based on the continuing ability of President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> to outmaneuver the opposition, is not likely to provide for the integration of conflicting groups required for stability over the longer term.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and the leaders of the various opposition parties have faced the necessity of working out their respective roles in the new political situation created by the restoration of civilian government in Pakistan. The country had been under military rule for 13 years and during this period no effective opposition had been allowed. Thus Pakistan has been handicapped by lack of experience in the operation of a representative political system. This problem is compounded by the fact that in Pakistan the concept of a “loyal opposition” has never been fully accepted. Moreover, because political parties lack solid cadre organization and are often little more than coalitions clustered around individuals, conflicts of personalities between leaders pose additional hurdles to the orderly conduct of party politics. These conflicts have been especially intense between <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and WALI KHAN of the National Awami Party (NAP) and between Wali and <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s Interior Minister Qayyum Khan.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the political process in Pakistan over the past 18 months has been characterized by a continual succession of crises. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s majority Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) faces a number of smaller parties which mostly center around regional or religious interests. All parties are fond of hurling excessive and unsubstantiated charges against others, leading to vocal and abusive exchanges. While most seem to accept this as an integral feature of Pakistani politics, these exchanges, never the less, intensify mistrust and personal antagonisms.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has proved himself especially adroit at maneuvering within this political system. He maintains the initiative by alloying situations to approach the crisis point, maximizes pressure on the opposition, and then unexpectedly offers a compromise which the opposition cannot afford to reject. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has repeatedly maneuvered the opposition into the position of having to choose between accepting his terms of compromise or else forfeiting its chance of sharing in the political process.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has discovered his inability either by suasion or strong-arm tactics to fragment and curb the opposition sufficiently to give him a free hand — especially in the provinces. Consequently, both <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and the opposition appear to be learning the limits of their strengths and may be better able to avoid violent confrontations.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s Major Problem</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto</persName> became President of Pakistan on December 20, 1971, while the nation was still stunned by the shock of military defeat and the loss of the East Wing. General Yahya Khan had been forced by his military associates to resign and <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, as leader of the majority party in the National Assembly, was called upon to succeed him as President and Chief Martial Law Administrator.</p>
                        <p>From the outset of his regime, President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has been handicapped by lack of political support in two of Pakistan's four provinces. In winning large majorities from the more populous provinces of Punjab and Sind, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s PPP had an overall majority in the National Assembly, but had won only one seat from the Northwest Frontier Province (<gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss>) and none from Baluchistan. While the PPP controlled majorities in the Provincial Assemblies of Punjab and Sind, it had only very limited strength in the Assemblies of <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> and Baluchistan. Thus, much of the political conflict in Pakistan has revolved around President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s attempt to assert his control in these two provinces where he is politically weakest.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s main opposition has been the National Awami Party headed by Khan Abdul Wali Khan. The NAP lacks national standing, but, together with its ally, the Jami'at-Ulema-i-Islam (JUI), initially mustered a majority in the Assemblies of the <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> and Baluchistan and thus claimed the right to form provincial governments. These two parties concede <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s right to rule at the center, but have vehemently fought all of his attempts to establish PPP authority in their two provinces. Thus when <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> announced in January 1972 that he would not convene the Assemblies until March, that he intended to maintain martial law for the indefinite future, and that he was appointing his loyal lieutenants as governors of all the four provinces, he was bitterly assailed by the opposition parties.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Confrontation and Compromise</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In early 1972 both <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and WALI KHAN essentially were attempting to consolidate their position before the other could act. Wali demanded the immediate convening of the provincial assemblies and the lifting <pb n="5" xml:id="d138-05" facs="d138-05"/>of martial law, citing <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s election campaign assertion that Pakistan's problems could be solved if only the government would transfer power to the elected representatives of the people. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, realizing that he lacked a majority in the provinces, was reluctant to yield power to the opposition-controlled assemblies and claimed that the continuation of martial law was necessary if effective social and economic reforms were to be implemented.</p>
                        <p>Heated rhetoric intensified the dispute and it appeared possible that Pakistan, having just emerged from a civil war, might face the prospect of further regional violence. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> faced other serious challenges at the same time: police strikes in large cities, labor unrest, and murmurs of discontent from top military leaders. But <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> managed to survive these challenges and the political crisis by meeting with WALI KHAN and agreeing to a compromise settlement on March 6. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> consented to call the provincial assemblies into session and to allow the NAP-JUI coalition to form governments; new governors having NAP-JUI support wound be appointed; the National Assembly would be convened to write an “interim Constitution”; and in exchange, WALI KHAN agreed to the continuation of martial law for another five months.</p>
                        <p>This agreement soon began to unravel due to conflicting interpretations. But President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> was able to patch together an equally dramatic compromise on April 14 during the National Assembly session called to ratify an interim constitution. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> proposed to abolish martial law immediately if the opposition would approve the government's draft. In spite of its dislike of the strong presidency called for in the draft, the opposition agreed to the deal — if only to avoid the onus for continuation, of martial law. Moreover, a committee composed of representatives of all the major parties was formed to draft the permanent constitution. Again, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> had engineered a compromise settlement from a seemingly intractable situation.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The temporary respite afforded by the April 14 agreement led to a short period of relative tranquility. The provincial assemblies met on May 2, but relations between the central government and the NAP-JUT coalitions in Baluchistan and the <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> remained tense, primarily because of deep personal antagonisms between party leaders. During the summer of 1972, the PPP, through its control of the central government and the provincial governments of Punjab and Sind, intensified its pressure on opposition parties. Lower-level opposition party officials were arrested as a warning of greater restriction to come if the opposition did not limit its activities. At the same time the government began a campaign to harass the opposition press. By withdrawing its advertising from these papers, the government deprived them of a vital source of income and, by restricting the distribution of newsprint, it forced them to limit the size and frequency of their editions.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d138-06" facs="d138-06"/>
                        <p>The government-controlled National Press Trust played up a number of anti-opposition themes, notably that of the alleged “London Conspiracy in which WALI KHAN and other NAP leaders had purportedly met in London to plan secessionist activities in the <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> and Baluchistan. This continuous propaganda barrage was designed to prevent the NAP from obtaining any national status by pinning on it the label of regional separatism and treason. Clearly frustrated by its failure to undermine the two non-PPP provincial governments, the government resorted to tactics often used before in Pakistan — false arrests and unsubstantiated accusations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The political system in Pakistan allows for this type of public vituperation and, in spite of the public sparring between the PPP and the opposition, all-party negotiations continued over the general outline of a permanent constitution. An agreement was reached on October 20 which outlined the division of power between the central and provincial governments and provided for a parliamentary system of government, albeit one which provided special advantages for the government in power. These two issues had been the major points of contention between <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and the opposition, and political observers were encouraged when this agreement was reached. Within amonth, however, the opposition parties began to have second thoughts and began to backtrack from certain points of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Increased Pressure and Another Crisis</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The government insisted that the opposition parties adhere to the draft that they had signed, while the opposition wanted, inter alia, to remove provisions requiring a two-thirds majority for passage of a vote of no-confidence. The PPP, already in control, was unwilling to dilute its power beyond the minimum necessary to win agreement on a constitution, while the opposition sought to increase the leverage it could utilize in working against the government.</p>
                        <p>As the deadlock continued the PPP mounted an intensified campaign to discredit the NAP and other opposition parties. The government accused the Baluchistan government of not maintaining law and order in the province and sought to manipulate tribal rivalries to its advantage. Moreover, the government accused NAP leaders In both the <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> and Baluchistan of quietly aiding the secessionist elements in those provinces.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d138-07" facs="d138-07"/>
                        <p>Central government exasperation with its inability to control events in these two provinces culminated in President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s use of the opportunity provided by the February 15 discovery of arms in the Iraqi Embassy in Islamabad to move against the provincial governments. Citing the alleged breakdown of law and order and the danger of subversion, he called for the resignation of the two NAP governors and dismissed the provincial ministry in Baluchistan. The consequent resignation of the <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> ministry put both provinces once again under central government control.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">A Dangerous Move</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> had the stronger hand, his move against the NAP-JUI governments was nevertheless a calculated risk. The NAP, deprived of its political power in the provinces, might well have resorted to violence to protest <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s action and, in any case, the move was certain to inflame regional antagonisms. In fact, however, while the NAP and other parties vehemently protested this violation of the 1972 agreements, they confined their protests to nonviolent means. Again, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> had caught the opposition off balance.</p>
                        <p>Having taken the initiative, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> maintained his momentum. The government arrested more opposition politicians and banned several opposition newspapers. At the same time, virtually all the opposition parties closed ranks in forming the United Democratic Front (UDF) and undertook a series of coordinated, well-organized opposition rallies. The crisis reached its peak when shooting broke out at a UDF rally held on March 23 in Rawalpindi.<note n="*" target="d138fn*">[footnote] In the exchange of fire, 9 people — mostly supporters of the UDF — were killed. The incident had a particularly dramatic and sobering impact throughout Pakistan because it took place in Liaquat Gardens where Liaquat ALI KHAN, Pakistan's last effective civilian political leader, had been assassinated in 1951.</note> While both sides accused the other of instigating the trouble, it appears that PPP supporters were the first to start shooting. WALI KHAN accused <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> of setting Punjabis against his own Pathan supporters — thus exacerbating regional conflict. When the UDF began a boycott of the National Assembly, threatened to proceed with ratification of the constitution without their participation. WALI KHAN that any constitution not receiving the support of all of the provinces would be invalid. Pakistan seemed once again at the breaking point.</p>

                        <p>However, the March 23 incident seems to have indicated to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> that he had reached the limit to which he could push the opposition. Having shown the iron fist, he now called for compromise. He offered to meet with the opposition, but the meeting failed to produce an acceptable compromise. Then, in an eleventh-hour maneuver, his law minister once again called for talks on the evening of April 9, with the final Assembly vote scheduled for the 10th. The next morning, while the Assembly waited, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and the opposition leaders hammered out a final compromise. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> made concessions on some points, such as certain religious provisions and constitutional safeguards. While he refused to accept a restoration of opposition government in the <gloss target="#t_NWFP1">NWFP</gloss> and Baluchistan, he promised some flexibility. The UDF leadership left the final decision on accepting the constitution to each individual opposition party, and although one party abstained, all others accepted the settlement. In the general euphoria following passage of the constitution, the government dropped many of the cases it had lodged against opposition politicians and journalists.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Prospects</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The constitutional settlement did not, however, institute a lasting truce. Both <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and WALI KHAN soon returned to hurling recriminations. The NAP-JUI coalition, still out of power, continues to demand that its provincial governments be reconstituted; <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> continues to resist.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is today stronger and more secure than at any previous time, but he has not yet integrated other political parties into the governmental process or given them a stake in the continued stability of Pakistan. His efforts to maintain the concentration of power in his own hands have left the opposition with no other option than to oppose the government simply for the sake of opposition: Moreover, his efforts to label the NAP as a regional and secessionist party have reinforced its tendency to rely on divisive regional sentiments at a time when Pakistan's greatest need is to create a sense of national identity following the disastrous events of 1971.</p>
                        <p>To be sure, a permanent constitution has been ratified which provides a role for the opposition, but the constitution will be meaningful only if the major opposition parties feel that the constitutional process will offer them the chance of sharing in political power. This, in turn, will depend on the extent to which both <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and the opposition are willing to accept a role for the other commensurate to its political support.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d138-09" facs="d138-09"/>
                        <p>Thus, Pakistan's prospects for stable constitutional government remain uncertain from his present secure power base, it is unlikely that President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> perceives any need to exceed past actions in order to limit the effectiveness of the opposition. His skillful use of carrot-and-stick tactics has so far enabled him to achieve his major objectives without driving the other political parties into violent reaction. Yet, in the long run, continued stability in Pakistan will depend on further integration of the various regional and economic groups through a greater accommodation of their interests. The present political process, based on the continued ability of President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> to outmaneuver the opposition, is not likely to provide for such integration or for stability over the long term.</p>

The Shah of Iran felt that the visit of Foreign Minister <persName>Singh</persName> to Tehran was very useful. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> and I have periodically reviewed the situation. [To <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>] We ought to do it again next week.

                            </hi>: The Shah did not mention it. He spoke firmly about not standing by if Pakistan is attacked. But he also said that he had told your Foreign Minister that there would be consultations between India and Iran before Iran made any irrevocable decisions.</p>
                        <p>We made clear that we are not intending any great arms programs for Pakistan. President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> will not come here with any great illusions.</p>

                            </hi>: If there were recognition, then <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> could talk to Bangladesh after recognition about the prisoners. If there were agreement on the exchange of Bengalis and Biharis, then the question of the 195 prisoners being held for trial could be held over. When there is recognition the Pakistanis and Bangladeshis could sort out the issue of trials.</p>

                            </hi>: If you could make a most forthcoming proposal—-if you wanted—we could present it to President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> here when he comes. We are not asking for a proposal. But if you wanted to, we would be prepared to talk to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. We would be prepared to support a reasonable proposal. In any case, we will not put obstacles in the way. It seems important to find some formula.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Minister, as long as you are here there is one thing I want you to take back with you. We have noticed that there is some criticism in the Indian press that we are stirring up sentiment in Bangladesh against India. This is absolutely untrue. We want the maximum stability in Bangladesh. Our interests are parallel to India's in this regard. We do not want Bangladesh to be focal point for anti-India propaganda.</p>

                        <p>Before <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> went to New Delhi, I told him that he should deal with me directly and not through regular channels. As a result, I have more mail about India than about any other country.</p>

Those in the foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations Committees seem relatively well disposed toward the proposal, while those in the Agriculture Committees seemed hesitant or opposed. In any case, it is not necessary that the Congress note on the proposal if the agreement is achieved along presently proposed lines.</p>

                            </hi>: I have had two meetings with Secretary Butz. He was helpful, although he said he could not help us to locate grain in the market. He told me that if the corn crop projections are good on August 9, there may be somewhat less pressure on wheat prices. We have bought almost 2 million tons now, but I have told our people to hold off now for a week or so to see if prices will fall. I have done that on the expectation that wheat exports will not be controlled.</p>

                            </hi>: Do you mind if we have Miss Ryan here to take notes in order to refresh my memory?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Of course not, I met her when I was here before. I am sure you don't need notes to refresh your memory.</p>
                        <p>I was just telling Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH8">Appelbaum</persName> that when I made a request to see you, we hadn't anticipated serious floods in Pakistan. The news is quite disturbing.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: I thought before that I would mention that we are quite happy on economics and so on. Remember last time the question of wheat requirements was raised. Because of the floods our needs are more urgent than ever. In today's news, of the 19 administrative districts in Punjab, 16 districts are disaster areas. The remaining 3 are hill districts. The 16 districts under water are where wheat and rice are produced. The water is 4 to 12 feet.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Melting snows and rains in the Himalayas.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: Yes, India was hit first. But the channels are deeper on our side than on India 's. We have never had such floods in the past 25 years. The crop was good and government procurements were made for urban areas.</p>

                        <p>I will leave this note on our assessment of the New Afghan Cabinet. [Tab A].</p>

                            </hi>: We have told the Soviets we would not intervene in Afghan affairs, but that if Afghanistan intrudes in Pushtunistan we would have to consider it an international matter.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: What comes out in our assessment of the personalities is that they are heavily loaded with elements that support Daud. There are two or three young army officers that helped plan the coup. Otherwise the cabinet is full of unknown entities. Those who are known have a strong pro-Pushtunistan bias. I am also sending a copy to <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>. Some are not known in the political life of the country.</p>
                        <p>Coming back to defense needs of Pakistan. It is my understanding that so far, as a base, the Shah has agreed.</p>

                            </hi>: What about the Chinese?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: They have given us old MIG 19s and some tanks and infantry weapons. They are quite frank with us and we believe them; they don't have sophisticated weapons.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: So we don't expect much beyond what we have received from the Chinese. When it comes to inventory, it is not a great deal.

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: I asked him at the dinner at the Iranian Embassy and he said he would communicate with President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. He didn't say no in so many words. If the question of Iran as a third country for war supplies is backed, it might materialize.</p>

                            </hi>: I think the Israelis can see no situation as good for them as what they have got. They are being asked to withdraw in exchange for a formal peace. And if there is a formal peace, the governments that make it won't last long. It is historically novel. Usually wars start between countries that are at peace. Only in the Middle East do wars start between countries that are already at war India and Pakistan are at peace formally, but there have been two wars in a decade. The Arabs are not making policy but waiting for a miracle.</p>

It is not true, really; Pakistan declared war on us on December 4 following a blitzkrieg on December 3. Fortunately, Yahya had given us ten days notice in a drunken interview with an American correspondent. He said he'd be at war in ten days. So they never got any of our planes.</p>

                            </hi>: We recognize Pushtunistan as a part of Pakistan. We think the Soviet Union has the same view, as they tell us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: To us too.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: They make this statement for the record. We have no such intention.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: That is my impression of the Shah's impression. I don't think this is beyond the power of your government to reassure him. He told us his Foreign Minister asked you if, before a war started, you could consult. It was significant that he told this to us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: What about the idea that we could all guarantee the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states in the area?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I mentioned it to him. He thought it was okay as long as it is not linked to any Soviet-Asian security scheme.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: No, it would be just the four. I told the Russians that such an idea is better if it came from inside the region instead of outside.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Of course, the Chinese are most sensitive on this score.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: It is ironic. The Chinese in the 1950s had the idea of an Asian security scheme.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Did you see that Neville Maxwell running around the border?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: He is a turncoat. When he was in India he was pro-Indian.</p>
                        <p>Haksar led our delegation to Pakistan. They have agreed to meet in Delhi on the 18th. SHAHI tried to create trouble, but Aziz straightened it out.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d141-07" facs="d141-07"/>
                        <p>We feel the meeting on the 18th is an opportunity. Progress has already been made on a package deal of simultaneous exchanges of all nationals stranded, plus returning all the POWs except the 195 that Bangladesh wants to try; and Pakistan wants to keep 203 they accuse of treason. If the rest is accepted, it would create the atmosphere for a solution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I think it would be a favorable development. I have the impression that the Chinese attitude would be favorable after that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> will be here.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We favor a solution of the prisoner issue, after which they can recognize Bangladesh, especially is a way can be found to avoid actual trials. Where are these prisoners now?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Still in India.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: The idea would be to turn them over to Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: If they agree to no trials, we could turn them over to Pakistan. Why not leave these 195 and 203 aside and agree on the rest?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I had the impression — I talked briefly to the Pakistani Ambassador today on the <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> visit — they thought progress was being made. But I could easily ask more specifically.</p>
                        <p>We will do nothing to provoke you — I can tell you that now —during his visit here. There won't be any arms deliveries agreed to.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: I wanted to tell you that — that any new arms would be and unhealthy development.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: There will be no arms decision, barring a drastic change in our relations. But that would mean the case of another war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Our impression is that there is a drastic improvement in our relations. The Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> — they all want to improve our relations.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d141-08" facs="d141-08"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We were impressed with the Prime Minister's efforts to dampen criticism of us during the Cambodian bombing, within the Congress Party.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Your State Department has too much of a tendency to take seriously what these various politicians say.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I'll get word to Pakistan on the negotiations, and will tell them we favor a good outcome.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: On the 195, if these can be frozen and the rest can proceed — the Bengalis in Pakistan and the Pakistanis in Bangladesh — the atmosphere will be better.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Do you think there might be an actual settlement on the 18th?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Providing <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> doesn't change his mind. It would be in his interest. It would make a good impression for his visit here. But he is a most unpredictable politician. I asked him at Simla, which is more important, withdrawal or prisoners? He said, both. Now the situation is different. It can be done, if he authorizes <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> to settle it. And in Rawalpindi he was positive.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I have the impression that they want a settlement. Of course, it is these war crimes trials that are the hang-up. I may drop by the Pakistani Embassy today. They have some sort of national day.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: We do too, from 6:00 to 8:00. It is actually just an internal occasion, for ourselves, and friends of India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Does that include me? [laughter] Can I drop by both? If I go to one I'll go to both.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: I think a hint from you will do the trick.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I'll talk to the Ambassador this evening and get some word back to you.</p>
                        <p>Is your Foreign Minister coming to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, he will be in New York on the 25th of September. I am planning to go home for a brief visit, from the 29th of August until the 13th of September Before that, I will be in Los Angeles and San Francisco I would like to meet the President, if that is possible.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: [to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RPW1">Rodman</persName>] Let's see if we can get an appointment next Tuesday in San Clemente.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: Then I could have something to tell the Prime Minister. On the rupees, my namesake says we are ready to settle in a week or ten days, if you are.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: On what terms?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: I think there are no sharp differences.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Then what is holding it up?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: He wanted the convertibility increased from two percent up to five percent. He has already agreed to three and one half percent; I think it will come up. The second point, there should be some reservation for a small third country like Nepal.</p>
                        <p>I hope it won't have to go back to Congress. He said it might.</p>
                        <p>If that is out of the way, we can talk about economic relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Our people have the impression that you're no longer interested in the Economic Commission.</p>

                            </hi>: I don't know who has given you that impression. Once PL 480 is out of the way and we can set up commissions on trade and aid, these groups would form the nucleus of a new Commission. But your people raise the problem of settling with the non-consortium members on rescheduling. This is a balance of payments problem for us because with them we have special arrangements.</p>
                        <p>I am told State's young bureaucrats are dragging their feet.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, because the British, Australia, Canada, all told us they have no objection. It is holding up a number of projects with the World Bank.</p>

                        <p>We would like that cleared up, the rupees cleared up, and something about economic aid — or “economic cooperation” as we call it — and then we can discuss the Economic Commission. Who gave you that impression?</p>

                            </hi>: On Cambodia, the Congress has more or less taken it out of our hands. We would like it as painless a transition as possible. Something on the Laotian model, perhaps with Sihanouk. Though we have no particular interest in Sihanouk. In Vietnam, things look fairly stable given <pb n="11" xml:id="d141-11" facs="d141-11"/>Vietnamese conditions. Do you have any contact with what we call the Khmer insurgents?</p>

                            </hi>: That is our impression. We have no organic interest either in China. But if the North Vietnamese keep pressing, we would have no choice but to look around. So if the North Vietnamese contribute to a restrained policy, it would be noted. And we would be prepared — if our Ambassador wants to give them your impression — to normalize relations.</p>

                            </hi>: I have no news I made a special point of talking to the Pakistani Ambassador after our talk [on August 15]. I told him not to make an issue now of the trials. We could understand their refusal to <pb n="2" xml:id="d142-02" facs="d142-02"/>see them tried, but perhaps, my instinct was, Bangladesh's feelings could be satisfied if the others were freed first and they were kept separated and were perhaps the subject of some amnesty or something. He checked with Islamabad. I had the impression the Pakistanis were willing to be quite constructive. The problem that seemed to bother them most was the Biharis.</p>

                            </hi>: I heard from Haksar on the talks. The morning session went well but the afternoon session was hard. <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> tried to deal with the prisoners by categories. They added up to a total of 69,000. He stuck with this and wouldn't budge. Haksar said the number verified by the ICRC who want to go is much higher. Aziz <persName>Ahmed</persName> said, “I can't increase this figure; maybe if MUJIB and <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> meet, it can be higher.”</p>

                            </hi>: I thought they had agreed on 200- 300,000.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: This is one of the obstacles. Bangladesh is taking back 250,000 Bengalis out of 400,000 who want to go back. You know we are keeping 100,000, from Sind, who want to go back, but we're not making an issue of this. On this point, Pakistan has to accept figures that are verified by the ICRC. Then they came to war crimes trials. <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> said, “Why can't we skirt it?” Haksar said we would consider the matter of skirting it, but first let the proper atmosphere be created by the repatriation of all the rest. Then <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> said he'd nevertheless keep the 203. This smacks of reprisals.</p>

                            </hi>: Should we talk to Bangladesh about this?</p>

                            </hi>: Well, it is really a matter between Bangladesh and Pakistan. If you want to tell Bangladesh to go slow on the trials, you can. They're very sensitive. We cannot really tell them. But I have the feeling that if Pakistan won't insist on these reprisals, this will put Bangladesh in a weak position. <pb n="3" xml:id="d142-03" facs="d142-03"/>My suggestion is to tell Pakistan, on one hand they must not continue to jiggle with the figure of 200,000 Bengalis. To use that as a bargaining point will create difficulties. Second, to assure them that the 195 will be kept in India, if they do not insist on reprisals.</p>

                            </hi>: My understanding of what you are saying is: If they drop the reprisals, you will undertake to keep the 195 until the other issues are settled.</p>

                            </hi>: We will keep them until Bangladesh and Pakistan settle this matter between them. The Pakistanis have the impression that Bangladesh desperately wants to be recognized. This is a misconception.</p>

                            </hi>: Your point is, if Pakistan agrees to accept 260,000 Biharis, let's go an equivalent number of Bengalis — including the 203 — you'll release all prisoners except the 195, and it's my personal understanding that those 195 will be kept in India until there is some understanding between Pakistan and Bangladesh.

But you realize it means that if they try them after all, you will be in <pb n="5" xml:id="d142-05" facs="d142-05"/>a brawl with us.

We don't like the detention of Pakistani prisoners, as I have told you. But we have not made a public issue of it. On the other hand, if we engage ourselves in mediation that turns out to be wrong, we will have to take a stand. I understand you won't give me a formal undertaking; your formulation is deliberately subtle, but the practical consequence is that they will stay in India.</p>

They are accustomed only to selling and to dealing with unlimited supply. They never checked with us for foreign policy aspects. It was just assumed we had all we needed. Other countries raised the possibility of combining on surplus commodities; our experts told us it was insanity and against American tradition and unconstitutional.

                        <p>Message to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>As you know, we have been using our influence with India in order to bring a humane and just solution to the recent war. While we are not familiar with all the details of the current negotiations, we have been reliably told that the following scheme might be acceptable:
<list>
                                <item>— India is prepared to release all Pakistani prisoners presently being detained except for the 195 which Bangladesh wishes held for war crimes trials.</item>
                                <item>— Bangladesh would release 260,000 non-Bengalis for resettlement in Pakistan, in exchange for 250,000 Bengalis from Pakistan, including the 203 Bengalis presently being held by Pakistan for treasonable activities.</item>
                                <item>— If Pakistan were to accept this offer, India would continue to hold the 195 in detention in India pending agreement between Pakistan and Bangladesh on recognition and on their disposition. Thus obviously they could not be turned over to Bangladesh without Pakistan's concurrence.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is our strong impression that India would not turn over the 195 prisoners to Bangladesh. Indeed, they anticipate that this two-stage process would lead to an early release of the 195 to Pakistan in the context of a negotiation on recognition.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d143-02" facs="d143-02"/>
                        <p>I have made it very clear that if Pakistan were to accept this offer and the 195 prisoners were subsequently put on trial anyway, it would have the most serious effect on relations between the United States and India.</p>
                        <p>I wanted you to have this information while the current negotiations are still going on. I would appreciate it if you could hold it in strictest confidence. If you would let us know your reaction, I will know how to conduct myself should new inquiries be made. We have taken no position at all on this proposal except that we would submit it to you.</p>
                        <p>Your reply should be made through the same channels as this message, or through your ambassador, since the existence of this proposal is not known in any official channels.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>This memorandum suggests a preliminary response to Pakistan's disaster needs. <persName corresp="#p_KSM2">Sultan Khan</persName> so far has emphasized our responding to Pakistan's grain request, but a comprehensive response will have to include other kinds of aid as well both because the food alone would not meet the problem and because our overall wheat availabilities will not permit us to what the Pakistanis are asking for.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Khan</persName> relayed a Pakistani request for one million tons of wheat and 30,000 tons of vegetable oil as soon as the floods began. This memo addresses our response to those requests and other things we can do to complement that response in addition to the helicopters, boats, medicines and other relief supplies we are already providing.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Wheat</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Khan</persName> asked for one million tons as soon as the floods began on the assumption that large amounts of grain from their exceptionally large crop had been destroyed in storage areas after harvesting. This is the same amount that Pakistan had earlier requested routinely for this fiscal year's normal PL 480 program. The Pakistani disaster relief chief in Islamabad has told our people there that it is too soon to estimate what has been lost. Undoubtedly substantial quantities have been destroyed in local storage areas, but it will be at least a couple of weeks before the real picture will be clear.</p>
                        <p>As you know, our own situation is very tight. Agriculture this week made an initial allocation of 1.13 million tons of wheat for the rest of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 <pb n="2" xml:id="d144-02" facs="d144-02"/>PL 480 needs. Thus the total <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 allocations are only about one-third of the allocation made during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973. Even this figure is reasonably high considering the present high prices and pressures for export controls.</p>
                        <p>At this point we can make an initial commitment of 100,000 tons for Pakistan, but we cannot be at all sure that, given the extreme shortage of wheat against all demands, we will be able to increase this later, This will not satisfy the Pakistanis, but it is about all we can do at the moment. We will watch carefully to see whether more wheat becomes available, and as Pakistan's needs become clearer we will watch to see whether they warrant further adjustments in other priority PL 480 programs. But for the moment the way to supplement our response on wheat is better found in other forms of aid than in trying to increase the amount of wheat significantly.</p>
                        <p>To understand the Pakistani grain problem fully, it is essential to recognize that the problem is not one of a starvation threat. There is other food in the country. The purposes behind Pakistan's request in past are (1) to prevent price increases and (2) to avoid having to dip into their rice stocks for domestic consumption since the rice can be exported to earn foreign exchange. Pakistan's current foreign exchange position is not bad, but either substantial wheat purchases in today's expensive world market of loss of earnings from the export of rice could cut deeply into their exchange holdings.</p>
                        <p>Because of our limited response to the Pakistani request and because of the essentially economic nature of the Pakistani problem, it seems desirable for us to shift the focus of Pakistani attention to other things that we can do to be helpful to supplement the grain allocation we can make. These other things lie in the area of providing foreign exchange aid.</p>
                        <p>Providing Foreign Exchange Assistance: Recovery Assistance Loan</p>
                        <p>This option has two parts.</p>
                        <p>The first is our response to a variety of further relief requirements that are daily being identified and met. These include the medicines, clothing, blankets, seeds, roof material, and specialized foods that we are already putting into the pipeline as the needs become known. These are being paid for out of disaster relief funds.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d144-03" facs="d144-03"/>
                        <p>The second consists of such items as pesticides and fertilizers that would enable the Pakistanis to make a quick recovery with their next crop. These cannot be paid for with disaster relief funds and would require regular aid money. For planning purposes, Williams feels we could think now in terms of a recovery assistance loan of up to $30 million. This would require reductions in other programs, although he would propose reporting this new need to the Congress in an effort to raise the overall aid total to soften the impact of these cuts.</p>
                        <p>The point here is that a special loan might begin to meet some of Pakistan's economic and rehabilitation problems and at the same time help them to supplement their food imports under PL 480. It used to be that it was easier for us to provide food than money, but at this point — tight as funds are — it is necessary and sensible to supplement food with money. The Pakistanis would not use this AID money directly for food, but it would release some of their own resources to buy food if that were judged necessary.</p>
                        <p>To establish a starting assessment for this recovery assistance program, Maury Williams is prepared to go to Pakistan next weekend on his way to Africa. This is not a trip he is asking for, but he recognizes that the gesture may be important as a sign of the President's attention, especially since we will not be able to respond to all of Pakistan's needs. There is the danger that a visit would raise Pakistani expectations too high. However, it would make the important point that U.S. help for recovery will be a continuing thing — not just a one-time response to one request for grain. It serves our interest to diffuse our response over time.</p>

                        <p>The vegetable oil problem involves existing export controls which remain in effect until September 30. These prohibit any export until then.

                        <p>SUBJECT: India and Its smaller Neighbors</p>
                        <p>BEGIN SUMMARY: The 1971 India-Pakistan War heightened suspicion of India among its more important smaller neighbors—Nepal and Sri Lanka. It also added a new member— Bangladesh—to this group. <pb n="2" xml:id="d145-02" facs="d145-02"/>While India is trying to reassure these countries by being correct and even generous in its official dealings with them, it cannot deny either its overwhelming greater strength or its natural involvement in their affairs. It does not want to incorporate them into India, but it feel's its security interests require that they should remain stable and free from Chinese control. It prefers to use the carrot rather than the stick to achieve this objective. But it has intervened forcefully in the affairs of certain of its neighbors in the past and all of them are painfully aware of this. So long as Indian tactics are non-interventionist, they are consonant with US policy. Nevertheless, the closeness of the countries, specific Indian security considerations, its self-image as the dominant power in the area, domestic Indian political pressures, bureaucratic differences within the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, and downright inefficiency together will continue to create tensions between India and its smaller neighbors. END SUMMARY.</p>

                            <item>Indian Involvement: Given the close ties between India and most of its smaller, independently minded neighbors, friction is almost inevitable All have in common a background of participation in the history of the geographic region now dominated by India. Present-day links vary but are close. Nepal is landlocked with its only economic access to the rest of the world across India. Most of its trade is with India. Both it and Bangladesh have long sieve-like borders with India. The evolving ties between India and Bangladesh reflect India 's key role in the <pb n="3" xml:id="d145-03" facs="d145-03"/> “liberation” of Bangladesh and its post-war assistance to the new a country. Various forms of Indian aid already spent or programmed total about $330 million; trade relations are being developed; and Bengalis on both sides of the border share a common cultural heritage. In the case of Sri Lanka, the overwhelming factor is the disaffected Tamil minority with its racial and possible political links to the Tamils in India. Trade is not at present a factor, but negotiations are underway to expand it, under state direction. Bhutan and Burma are exceptions. The common border between India andBurma lies at the extremity of India's most isolated region, and since 1961 Burma has consciously restricted contact with other countries, including India. Bhutan has the potential for becoming another, but to date the low levels of economic and political development in Bhutan and its international isolation have prevented this.</item>

                            <item>Historic Relationships: India has already involved itself in these countries. Although on occasion (e.g., in Ceylon in 1971) this was on behalf of the established government, the tendency is to remember Instances when India supported intervention—in the early 1960's when the Nepali Congress Party mounted raids into Nepal from India, in 1971 when India supported the Bangladesh “liberation” effort, and in 1973 when it tightened its grip on its protectorate, Sikkim. The largest and most important of these smaller neighbors— Bangladesh—<pb n="4" xml:id="d145-04" facs="d145-04"/>obviously welcomed Indian “intervention”. Even so, historic problems resulting from the close physical relationship—problems left over from the period of confrontation under the Pakistan regime—are not proving amenable to solution.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Indian Policy: Since 1971 India has sought to reassure its smaller neighbors that it accepts and wishes to strengthen the existing state system in South Asia. It has played down its involvement in the affairs of its neighbors, has tried to resolve many-old problems, and has acted effectively and often generously to head off some new ones. Indian officials have been visiting, discussing, explaining and giving assistance. Mrs. Gandhi has gone to Kathmandu, Dacca, Thimphu (Bhutan), and Colombo, and her ministers have followed up. Discussions with Bangladesh have been almost continuous. At least some progress seems to have been achieved in speeding up implementation of the plantation-worker Tamils from Sri Lanka, in discussing with Sri Lanka the question of sovereignty over tiny Kachchitivu Island, in joint development of the water and hydroelectric resources of Nepal, in agreeing not to divert the waters of the Ganges at Farakka before agreement is reached with Bangladesh, and in fresh economic assistance for all three countries. <pb n="5" xml:id="d145-05" facs="d145-05"/>Nevertheless in the context of this overall “correct” relationship, there are instances when India feels constrained to lean on its neighbors. Such pressure has been and is still more likely to fall on Nepal than the other small neighbors, because of the extreme closeness of the physical, economic and historic relationship. India has always been concerned about Chinese aid projects in the portion of Nepal bordering India. It objected to the Chinese cotton-growing experiment there and either has or probably will object to the proposed Chinese-assisted textile mill. Although generally accommodating on the aid and trade side recently, India has pressed Nepal (unsuccessfully) to agree to joint industrial ventures, planning coordination, and food grain sales by the Nepalese Government to India. Finally, India applied the screws to involve the King to a greater extent in Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s visit to Nepal.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Determining Factors: (a) Security: India's main interest in its smaller neighbors is security against China. This is particularly true in the case of Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sikkim, any of which would provide China with strategic access to the southern side of the Himalayas. The island of Sri Lanka, on the other hand, is less of a problem, and India has historically been willing to tolerate a higher level of Chinese involvement there, where Chinese access is at the end of a long sea route, than in the north.</item>
                            <label>5</label>
                            <item>. Security against China requires (a) reasonable stable governments <pb n="6" xml:id="d145-06" facs="d145-06"/>which (b) are not anti-India. (Stable governments are also important in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan because conflict there could easily spill across the open border into similar areas of India.) India prefers democratic governments such as those in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, in part because it considers them less likely to be anti-India. It is also satisfied with the monarchy in Bhutan because it appears stable and friendly for the time being. It has doubts about the long-run chances of survival of the monarchy in Nepal, however, and about the stability of the government in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It is basically satisfied none of these governments is now repeat now pursuing an anti-Indian policy (although there is abundant anti-Indian feeling in each country). Much of Indian policy toward them is intended to serve the dual objective of keeping them from becoming anti-Indian while helping to maintain at least short-term stability. Economic aid to Bangladesh and Nepal, for example, is intended to keep them friendly as well as to help to prevent the economic problems of those countries from getting to the point where they would threaten order.</item>
                            <pb n="7" xml:id="d145-07" facs="d145-07"/>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>While preferring to achieve its objectives by its present approach, India has not ruled out intervention. It allows dissident Nepali Congress Party leaders to live in India in part, probably, because it sees some use for them if the monarchy ultimately collapses. In Sri Lanka in 1971 it helped the government against the insurgents, as did the United States, the Soviet Union, and Pakistan. Indian officials claim they would do so again if asked. In 1973 India intervened when the situation got out of hand in Sikkim, which in any case had never achieved the level of independence of the other Himalayan states, under either the British or India. Beyond these instances, however, Indian action will probably depend on circumstances, such as the degree of threat and the likelihood of wider involvement. India would probably help Bangladesh, at the latter's request, to subdue a revolt in one district. A more widespread uprising, election of an anti-Indian government or a broad breakdown of governmental organization and order, would present difficult choices about which the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> prefers not to think right now and about which almost no Indians appear to have clearly defined ideas.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>(b) India's Self Image: Talk of India's dominant position in the area raises the hackles of its smaller neighbors. India recognizes this and protests it is not a power. But it cannot deny the fact of its <pb n="8" xml:id="d145-08" facs="d145-08"/>dominance, and it expects its smaller neighbors to recognize if not acknowledge it. One still hears occasional talk of possible “encirclement” of India by its smaller neighbors, supported by the United States. American assistance to these countries thus produces an ambivalent Indian reaction. India recognizes these countries need the assistance, but it also recalls that in at least one of these countries (Nepal) the United States no longer sees its interests as derivative of its interests in India.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>(c) Domestic Political Pressures: The linkages between India and her smaller neighbors have created groups within India with a special interest in Indian relations with these countries. They articulate these interests through the Indian domestic political process. Thus, Indian Congress Party members from areas bordering Nepal press for Indian support for the Nepali Congress against the monarchy. Indian businessmen trading with Nepal lobby in India for their own interests. Some West Bengalis and other Indian businessmen have both real and sentimental interests in re-establishing the semi-colonial pre-1947 relationship between Calcutta and its natural economic and cultural hinterland—now Bangladesh. Finally, the regional party ruling the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu supports the cause of the Tamils in Sri Lanka. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> appears to be successfully resisting these pressures at present. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> stands aloof from the Nepali Congress, and <pb n="9" xml:id="d145-09" facs="d145-09"/>the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> doesn't lend official support even if it deliberately or inadvertently fails to catch Nepali Congress perpetrators of last year's armed attack and the recent hijacking. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> also severely restricts other travel of West Bengalis and other Indian businessmen to Bangladesh in order to prevent charges that they are trying to re-establish domination over the area. It does not support the Tamil autonomist/separatist movement in Sri Lanka. Pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to change these policies may become more insistent, however, if the clash of central and state Interests becomes sharper (e.g., if Bangladesh remains adamant against diversion of the Ganges at the Farakka barrage to flush out the port of Calcutta) or in the competition for votes at election time.</item>

                            <item>(d) Bureaucratic Differences and Inefficiencies: The “correct” posture represents the position of the Foreign Ministry. On important issues it is usually able to impose its view on other ministries. But given their proximity and the depth of their involvement with India, its smaller neighbors often find themselves dealing directly with other ministries, or even with state governments. Here parochial interests come into play and tend to undermine the good intentions of the Foreign Ministry. Thus, the Commerce Ministry may take a tough line with Bangladesh about settlement of its trade balances; Sri Lanka finds customs and/or trade officials turning away bottled imports from Sri Lanka because the import content in the bottle caps is higher than the <pb n="10" xml:id="d145-10" facs="d145-10"/>agreed limit; Nepal has a long list of complaints about the customs, excise and state trading authorities. One suspects the Indian bureaucrats in these other ministries also are not always as considerate of the sensibilities of these smaller countries as their Foreign Ministry counterparts. All of this grates on proud officials of Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Prospects and US Interests: The official Indian policy is consonant with our interest in having a South Asia of stable, independent states where no outside power has an exclusive position. We should recognize that there will continue to be instances when, as a result of pressures on and forces at play within the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, India sends its neighbors signals at variance with the official <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> position. India's relations with her smaller neighbors will continue to be marked by periodic flare-ups, particularly we believe in the case of relations with Nepal and Bangladesh. All the smaller neighbors suspect India really wants hegemony, and indeed it may. They react by trying to maintain close relations with world powers. While we can argue that such relations help India by reducing the super-sensitivity and increasing the economic viability of its neighbors, they also decrease Indian leverage over these countries. This is an ambiguity we must live with. We have made clear that we are not going to give India a veto over our relations with these countries. The most we can do is to try to avoid, creating unnecessary suspicions and to set the Indians straight swiftly <pb n="11" xml:id="d145-11" facs="d145-11"/>and frankly if they begin acting as though we are poaching on their turf.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>The big question is Bangladesh, which could turn rabidly anti-Indian. This will be depicted as the result of American or Sino-American intervention. We have already raised this point at the highest levels of the Indian Government, saying don't let it get started, but I personally question whether any policy or conduct on our part will significantly effect the outcome, whatever that turns out to be. Some destinies are just that: destined.</item>

                            <item>Possible American Initiatives Toward India</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Here is the list of possible American initiatives toward India for which you asked. They are grouped under Atmospherics, Political Support, and Economic Support. The Advantages and Disadvantages of each move are summarized.</p>
                        <p>In general, the balance of the argument is with the Disadvantages. (One exception: A visit by you or George Shultz to sign a rupee agreement.) This outcome corresponds closely—as presumedly it ought—to a Six Month exercise we carried out in mid-August, asking how we were doing, with a special prize for the nastiest answer. The consensus was that we are doing all right enough, that we have restored relations to a correct level of cordiatlity, and that we have genuinely impressed the Indians with our desire to create a new and enduring relationship. However, we do not think we have got across any concept of what a new relationship might be other than a version of the “old,” idealized relationship of the early 1960s. This is not altogether our fault. Indians have but little feel for American realities. But it is nonetheless partly our fault. From the time I arrived we have been going to the Indians with proposals for things we might do together. We have been tough, even brutal about actions and statements on their part which do not please us. (Thus, when they were getting set to have a small <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> subversion sandal early in the spring, I told them that if the young man being accused was sent home I would go home with him, and would give no guarantees whatever as to when or whether a successor would be appointed. They stopped.) But still, it is we who have presented aide-memoires on rupees, on development assistance, on trade expansion, etc. So far, they have not responded to any save the rupee proposal. Accordingly, toward the end of August we adopted a policy of taking no further initiatives. It is now, we feel, their move.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d146-02" facs="d146-02"/>
                        <p>I would call attention, however, to a new American role in India, that of Creditor. Over the next five years, Indian dollar debt service paid to the United States will average $130 million per year, 30 percent of their earning from exports to the US. I see no way for us to avoid becoming a net recipient of Indian aid (sic) unless we go in for debt rescheduling on a large scale, a move Treasury will understandably resist. (The administration envisaged $75 million in development loans for India this year; the Senate has approved $28 million for the world. The West Germans will give India $126 million this year, three to four times as much aid to India as we are likely to provide.) We can and will argue that we contribute through the World Bank and other such institutions, but it will be a tough point to make. We think a balance of payments crisis is at least a possibility. (Everyone else in Delhi thinks it inevitable.) I would anticipate a general move or a debt moratorium or even debt repudiation. In the meantime the economy will deteriorate and trade will not expand.</p>
                        <p>These latter considerations argue against being too passive, even at the risk of giving the Indians the wrong impression. I assume we do not want to end up looking as if we are contributing, and deliberately so, to the woes of the subcontinent which seemingly must now grow even worse.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>(a) Moves involving atmospherics are easy to make in that they entail no bureaucratic or Congressional authorization for political action or resource allocation.</p>
                        <p>(b) The Indians like atmospherics and such moves could make a broad, positive impression in India and provide a framework in which Indian policy-makers can make decisions favorable to the US on a variety of small issues as they come up.</p>
                        <p>CON: (a) Improving atmospherics could raise Indian expectations that the US is prepared to follow through on concrete political and economic issues to a greater extent than we would be willing to do.</p>

                                <p>Specific atmospherics: A continuing correspondence on Indo-US relations between Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                                <p>PRO: (a) Provides a framework for serious high-level exchange of views on Indo-US relations.</p>
                                <p>(b) Contributes to a responsible dialogue by encouraging the Indians to channel suggestions and complaints to us through official correspondence rather than through public posturing.</p>
                                <p>CON: (a) An ongoing correspondence of this sort tends to become “taken for granted” and simply astaff-level chore when there might be nothing to say, when there is nothing to say, the absence of correspondence could be taken as a negative signal.</p>
                                <p>(b) This is already being done, in substance, through Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>; and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> and P.N.

                                <p>Following a rupee settlement, put out a statement on Indo-US relations which would amount to a sort of “principles for Indo-US relations.” This could be done through either an exchange of letters between the President and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, a communique during a high-level US visit (perhaps by Secretary Shultz or Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>) timed to coincide with the signing of the settlement.</p>
                                <p>PRO: (a) Would clearly put the time of troubles behind us and provide a positive framework for future Indo-US relations.</p>
                                <p>(b) A carefully drafted document would be favorably received in India .</p>
                                <p>(c) It could offer India a balance to the Indo-Soviet treaty and publicly highlight and encourage balance in future Indian relations vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US.</p>
                                <p>(d) It could have broader utility for the US in that it would highlight our readiness to establish principles for relations with the largest third-world country after we had taken such a step with respect to the Soviets, and toChina in the Shanghai communique.</p>
                                <p>CON:(a) Since the Indians are the way they are, any such guidelines could provide a measuring stick for criticizing US actions with regard to India, its neighbors, or the Indian Ocean that the Indians don't like.</p>
                                <p>(b) Would unduly arouse Indian expectations.</p>

                                <p>Following a settlement of the PL 480 rupee question, arrange for a high-level visit to India by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> or Treasury Secretary Shultz. (With or without option 2 above)</p>
                                <p>PRO:(a) Could mark the end of a troubled period and the beginning of a new and better stage in our relations.</p>
                                <p>(b) Could over come Indian feeling that the US doesn't care about India while at the same time not over-playing our interest.</p>
                                <p>(c) Could have some value for the Administration at home and highlight to American critics of past Indian policy that we have settled our 1971 disagreements and how have Indo-US relations solidly back on the tracks.</p>
                                <p>CON: (a) If our visitor doesn't have anything solid to offer, the visit might be taken as a fairly hollow gesture; if the visit didn't go off well, it could be counterproductive.</p>

                                <p>CON:(a) Since we would have to sell to Pakistan as well, this would merely lead to an arms race between two very poor countries with a demonstrated hatred of each other.</p>
                                <p>(b) Advanced weapons in India's arsenal are Soviet and our action would run counter to the restraint we have urged on the Soviets in the provision of arms to the subcontinent.</p>
                                <p>(c) Indians will assume we are ending arms embargo mainly to help Pakistan, not India.</p>

                                <p>Offer more explicit US assurances regarding non-transfer of arms from Iran to Pakistan.</p>
                                <p>PRO: (a) Would reassure Indians on matter with which they are obsessed at little cost to us or Iran since situation in which Iran says it would transfer arms unlikely to occur.</p>
                                <p>(b) Might allow us to make political capital out of Congressional action on this issue (Magnuson Bill).</p>
                                <p>(c) There has still not been an acknowledgement to the Indian Ambassador by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary that our law prohibits such exchanges. Such an acknowledgment by one of them when the subject next comes up might help relieve Indian fears.</p>
                                <p>CON:(a) The possibility of transfers from Iran is not an openly hot issue between the US and India right now; the Indians are trying to protect themselves on this in the way we want them to, i.e., by improving relations with Iran; if we come forward with further assurances now, we may just turn the Indian search for protection back to promises by the US.</p>
                                <p>(b) We might open ourselves up to sharper backlash in the event of any Iranian arms transfers to Pakistan.</p>

                                <p>NOTE: Indian officials claim there were some transfers in 1971 and a recent <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> document supports this. They ask what we have done about those. We have no reply, and this makes citing the law sound rather hollow.</p>

                                <p>Make a statement highlighting our recognition of India's pre eminent position in the subcontinent and our willingness to do business with the area in terms of the “new realities.” This might be simply an expansion and fleshing out of the President's 1973 policy statement and what you have already told the Indians.</p>
                                <p>PRO: (a) The Indians would welcome this as meeting their position on the central issue of their own foreign policy.</p>
                                <p>CON:(a) We have already said as much and gone as far as we should to meet the Indians on this.</p>
                                <p>(b) Such a statement might needlessly make India's neighbors bristle.</p>
                                <p>(c) Practice is more important than polemic here India knows we no longer see our interest in at least one of these countries (Nepal) as derivative of our interest in India. We are not going to allow an Indian veto on our relations. We are already careful to inform the Indians in Kathmandu, Colombo and Dacca of our programs; the only additional effort we could make would be to tell the Indians more in Delhi.</p>
                                <p>(d) Indians might suspect we are trying to portray them as having expansionist, hegemonic intentions in south Asia. They already have reacted adversely to comments on India's new power status.</p>

                                <p>Pro:(a) There are likely to be occasions when India wants our help on getting its nominees in international offices and in supporting Indian positions in various conferences; we can probably help on some of these issues and we can point them out as illustrative of our cooperation.</p>

                                <p>(b) If a dramatic indication of improved Indo-US relations is wanted, this does not fill the bill.</p>

                                <p>(b) This move could be a disaster in light of a variety of factors relating to the dynamics of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, our recently enunciated support of a permanent Security Council seat for Japan, and the unpredictability of India on the Council.</p>

                                <p>(b) It might assuage Indian feelings (which are not strong) over being shut out of a voice in Southeast Asian affairs by the US (our opposition to Indian participation in the new International Control Commission for Viet-Nam); what some Indians see as US-Chinese plans to settle the future of Southeast Asia; and proposals to expand the Western-oriented Association of Southeast Asian nations.</p>
                                <p>CON: (a) Such a move would be viewed with puzzlement and suspicion by Southeast Asian countries which dislike and mistrust India.</p>
                                <p>(b) The limitations on India's capacity to participate in Southeast Asian affairs was set by its own weakness, lack of consistent interest in the area, and preoccupation with South Asia; it would be quixotic for us to take up the cudgels for India on this.</p>

                                <p>Tell the Indians that after the POWs are returned we will encourage the Chinese to improve relations with India.</p>
                                <p>PRO:(a) This might marginally undercut residual Indian suspicions that the US and China are conspiring against India.</p>
                                <p>CON:(a) The Chinese are going to do this anyway and the Indians know it.</p>
                                <p>(b) Because of the greater importance of our bilateral relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and with China, we should not insert ourselves into their triangular maneuverings and suspicions.</p>

                                <p>Propose another round of Indo-US bilateral talks.</p>
                                <p>PRO:(a) Since these were held in 1968 and 1969 but postponed in 1971, this would be a concrete indication that 1971 has been put behind us.</p>
                                <p>(b) The talks could be as substantive as desired. (The first two rounds followed the general formula of each side stating its position on world issues. It had been proposed that the 1971 round get down to specifics of the Indo-US relationship, but they were never held.)</p>
                                <p>CON:(a) Such talks aren't much use unless they are specific, and we can handle the specifics just as well by discussions by the Ambassador here in Delhi.</p>
                                <pb n="10" xml:id="d146-10" facs="d146-10"/>
                                <p>(b) Maybe holding them would be too much of an indication of a return to the status quo ante.</p>
                                <p>(c) The talks in the past have more often generated heat, not light.</p>

                                <p>Propose reconsideration of a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.</p>
                                <p>PRO:(a) It would be symbolic of improved relations.</p>
                                <p>(b) The substance, which mainly concerns trade and investment, would mesh nicely with our emphasis on a new economic relationship in which aid plays a much smaller role.</p>
                                <p>(c) The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> might be interested in the general idea of a broad agreement of friendship as a counterweight to the treaty with the Soviet Union.</p>
                                <p>CON:(a) We follow a fairly rigid format for such treaties a format which the Indians in the past have rejected. One point of particular difficulty concerns our provision about independent determination of compensation in the case of expropriation. This clashes with the Indian constitutional requirement that Parliament is supreme when it comes to setting compensation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JLK1">Jha</persName> raised with us the possibility of some kind of agreement about the time when India signed its treaty with the Soviet Union. He dropped it when we went over our format with him. Since then there has been the constitutional amendment re-establishing Parliamentary primacy in setting compensation.</p>

                                <p>Respond favorably to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>'s suggestion of a cultural exchange agreement.</p>
                                <p>PRO:(a) This would ensure that at least the amount of exchange specified in the agreement takes place. Presumably this would mean an expansion of the current low level of American academic travel to India and resumption of travel to the United states by Indian politicians and journalists under the International Visitor Program. It might also help get American films and cultural presentations into India.</p>
                                <p>(b) It would help end Indian suspicion that our programs are somehow subversive.</p>
                                <p>CON:(a) We have such agreements mainly with communist states because these states wish to maintain extremely rigid control over exchanges.</p>
                                <p>(b) Many of the things—such as exchange of films and cultural presentations—simply wouldn't work.</p>

                                <p>PRO:(a) Demonstrate to the Indians that we have a sincere concern in assuring a fair share of the world's foodstuff for emergency distribution in countries like India.</p>
                                <p>CON: (a) In order to bring off such a world food bank, the US might have to bear a disproportionate share of the financial and the material cost of the plan.</p>
                                <p>(b) Locating the storage factory in India might make it difficult to get food out of India to meet a shortage elsewhere if India were also short on food.</p>

                                <p>(b) Would involve the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> heavily in investment matters and set a dangerous precedent for our investments elsewhere.</p>

                                <p>(b) American trade unions might look on this as an export of jobs financed by the American tax payer.</p>

Such a program might include: provision of fertilizer; investment in new fertilizer plants; investment in new power plants for rural electrification; help for tube wells and other irrigation facilities; research on new seeds, etc. The US could provide a maximum of financing and minimum of technical assistance (no intrusiveness).</p>

                            </hi>: When I later saw Chou En-Lai, he said I could tell my US friends that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit was the best kept secret since D-Day.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: When I came for President Kennedy's funeral, I was Foreign Minister. Ayub Khan was in Dacca at the time, and by the time I got his consent to go, it was late and I had to use a chartered plane. I met President Johnson, and the first thing he said to me was, “So, you are going to break bread with Chou En-Lai.” I was taken aback. It is a good thing I knew <pb n="2" xml:id="d147-02" facs="d147-02"/>my Bible; otherwise I would not have known the phrase “breaking bread.” Here I had come simply to bring the condolences of my people, and I was confronted with that statement. Times have changed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: He was a very direct man.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry our visit had to be postponed from July. However, more things have happened and we can discuss them.</p>
                        <p>The important point I want to emphasize is what I said in my welcoming remarks—that the independence of Pakistan is a cornerstone of US foreign policy. I chose the word “cornerstone” deliberately; I spoke with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> about it as we walked over to the ceremony. We have always felt this way. We have not always been as successful in our policies as we might have been. However, this is the situation now. We hope your visit will reemphasize our dedication to that principle. Everything else will fit into that proposition. Our relations with Iran and with the PRC fit into that framework. We will not compromise on that principle. Our new Secretary of State [pointing to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>] understands this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We have told Chou En-Lai this is our view. We have encouraged China to give military supplies to Pakistan, and we will find out through what means it is possible for us to help. We had extensive talks with the Shah, and we urged him to make contingency plans and his own deployment in ways that would help Pakistan, as well as to transfer equipment when possible. We have also made it clear to India that this is our policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Making this clear to India has been at considerable domestic cost. We have a number of people in the US who are enthusiastic supporters of India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: The Soviet Ambassador approached me on Afghanistan. I told him that if the recent coup in Afghanistan remained an internal Afghan affair, that would be one matter. But if it resurrected the Pushtunistan dispute, the US would be engaged. This is the basic policy of the President.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d147-03" facs="d147-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We can talk candidly about this. When you were here before [December 1971], I explained to you that domestic public opinion in the US is somewhat difficult to handle. At the time of the India-Pakistan war in 1971, no one could understand why we did not back India. It is ironic that our great newspapers like the New York Times and our columnists argue that we should back India simply because it was “bigger.” The world will not be safe for anybody but the very big and very strong if we adopt that as a principle of our foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>While we seek good relations with all nations, we consider Pakistan to deserve our continued friendship regardless of India or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This is not just because we are pro-Pakistan, although I admire the guts and courage of the Pakistani people. But this is not just a matter of friendship; it is a matter of the interests which the US has in a peaceful world. It is our interest that a nation not be overrun. On this our policies are in agreement. When we get down to particulars in our relationship, there may be someproblems. But on the big issues we agree.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: Thank you very much. This is a rare opportunity to talk with you. Please allow me to be candid because we do not have the opportunity to talk frequently.</p>
                        <p>First, I know that some people think there is a highly subjective element in south Asia, that emotions blind people there to cold logic. It is true that we have had personal regimes in Pakistan; there has been too much of that. Having said that, however, we know that you understand the subcontinent extremely well. You have been there. There is no naivete in this office on the situation in South Asia. You also come from a party that has long experience in Asia. You have had your own personal experiences there. That helps a great deal.</p>
                        <p>We Pakistanis would like to make our humble contribution to your effort to bring peace around the world. The Middle East problem is interconnected with the South Asian one. <pb n="4" xml:id="d147-04" facs="d147-04"/>Pakistan cannot be unaware of that, and every day we find new emphasis being put on the importance of the Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>India is claiming to be a big power, but it is not clear what being a big power means. There are more people starving today in India than in Pakistan. There are many contradictions in India and we feel sorry for the Indian people and the economic privations they suffer.</p>
                        <p>The recent floods have set Pakistan back. Otherwise, we would have been looking forward to self-sufficiency in wheat and sugar and we have already been exporting rice. If it had not been for the floods, the prospects of our going ahead would be bright. In contrast, India is disillusioned with its own lack of progress.</p>
                        <p>India also seems disillusioned with what has happened in Bangladesh. If Pakistan had followed a “NEHRU policy” there would have been a number of Bangladeshs in India in the 1960s.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> made the same point to me the other day.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: It has been my feeling that India started a process in Bangladesh that would work to the long-range disadvantage of India itself.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Not that we wish India to have trouble. I simply want to note that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and you have each raised the same point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: India has burned its fingers in the furnace of Bengal. Over the years we have had Sikhs, Nagas, Nizos approach us for help against India. They wanted our support in their fight for autonomy within India. We did not give them our support.</p>
                        <p>There are other factors than “bigness” involved in being a big power. There is the strength of economy. India's legs are hollow. They are building a huge military colds sus at the same time. But that is India's look-out. <pb n="5" xml:id="d147-05" facs="d147-05"/>Another element one must assess is geographic position. Pakistan is situated at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Any state that has access to the Karachi coast can dominate the Gulf. That is why the Soviet Union is so interested in that coast.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan has been committed to Western civilization. We have been committed to the US. In earlier days, there was a simplistic approach to world affairs in which the choice was between God and Satan, and we chose God. NEHRU used to say that Pakistanwas the most allied ally of the US. Pakistan supported the UK in the Suez crisis, and the Egyptians say they have not forgiven us yet. We have always tried to make our contribution. We kept away from Third World non-alignment sentiments.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, NEHRU visited the Soviet Union, and the India-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relationship grew closer. That was in the 1950s.</p>
                        <p>In the 1960s, our relations with the US on a people-to-people level remained profound. There was only one consideration that caused difficulties in the relationship—Pakistan's relationship with the PRC. That relationship was rooted in the fact that the Soviets were pressing on Pakistan since they had an interest in a warm water outlet. That being the case, we did not want bad relations with China at the same time. Apart from our relationship with China as a neighbor of South Asia, we felt that the problems of Southeast Asia would not be solved without Chinese participation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: It is only fair to say, too, that the fact that the US at that critical time seemed to cool its relations with Pakistan forced. Pakistan to revise those relations. I was in Pakistan in 1964. I saw Ayub Khan then. He said to me, “Trust is like a thin thread; once it is broken, it is hard to put together again.” The initiative to China had to develop.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: For Pakistan the changing relationship with the US was more painful. There was a romanticism in the relationship. This was wrong, stupid. But it was there.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d147-06" facs="d147-06"/>
                        <p>The changing mood also coincided with the Sino-Indian conflict of 1972, along with the Soviet pressure in Pakistan. At that time, Averell Harriman came to Pakistan with Duncan Sandys. Pakistan could have walked into Kashmir. Harriman told us not to move. He told us that the US supports a full settlement of the Kashmir problem. Then, Harriman and Sandys went to New Delhi and told Nehru that the US was eager to help India and India pulled back.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: He pulled back when India didn't need us anymore.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Or at least he could take us for granted.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: He thought he could get something for nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: The US jumped the gun. We urged restraint, but the US felt NEHRU was forthcoming and responded. The US provided $60 million in credit without consulting with Pakistan. Pakistan asked why the US was in such a hurry. That was in December 1962. In March 1963, another $60 million for India was announced. The US said that its global interests required this. Pakistan asked how India had modified its views. Then Pakistan began negotiating with India. Pakistan advised the continuation of negotiation, but while these were going on, the White House issued a statement saying that a Kashmir settlement was not necessary. After that, Pakistan did not say any more, but the US went on to provide long-term assistance to India.</p>
                        <p>India took advantage of this. India is an important nation, but India needs US economic assistance and PL 480. The US does not need India. There is no reason why the euphoria toward India should continue. The Secretary of State Designate has said that the days of that kind of euphoria are finished and that your policy would be pragmatic from here on.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan is not the only neighbor of India that has suffered—Nepal, Sikkim, Burma and China have all suffered similarly. So it is not that Pakistan is wrong and India is right. And it is not that Pakistan does not want good relations with India. <pb n="7" xml:id="d147-07" facs="d147-07"/>Pakistan is determined to have good relations because we have promised a better life for our people. We have shown our bona fides. But living in peace with India does not mean Indian hegemony in South Asia.</p>
                        <p>The experience of 1971 was a freak. There were a couple of morons in power in Pakistan. Now, Bangladesh is in difficult straits.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: What do you project for Bangladesh?</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We have seen intelligence reports to the effect that there are Pakistani flags from time to time flown in Bangladesh. Do you see the same reports?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: This is just for our information. They are good people. Many top Pakistani leaders were from Bengal, and I have met some of them. What do you think is going to happen? Do you think Bangladesh will survive?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: Of course, the people will survive. But they are a most unfortunate people. We want good relations with them and we will have them. But, as I see it, it is inevitable that they will come under Chinese influence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I'm sorry. I did not mean to interrupt.</p>

                            </hi>: We are prepared to have good relations with Bangladesh. If it had not been for the floods, we would have the most viable unit in South Asia. If Bangladesh wants a loose relationship with us in the future, we are prepared to have some kind of loose confederal relationship with them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">We are going to have a problem with the Afghans. Now they lay claim to two Pakistani provinces. This keeps raising the question</hi>: Is something wrong with the basic concept of Pakistan? I don't think this can be. Two million people have given their lives for the idea of Pakistan. But people keep calling it into question.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: The tragedy of the early days was in not settling the Kashmir question right at the outset.</p>

                            </hi>: Pakistan must have some meaning. Two million people have given their lives for it. Why do we have these problems? It is easy to stir up secession anywhere in the world. The Indians seem to be concentrating on that.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan now has 65 million people and is moving ahead. It is not that Afghanistan wants to revive its claim from the past; there is more to it than that. We believe that the USSR is interested in reviving this problem. Afghanistan by itself is no problem for Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Now, when we talk about this, the US Government position has been that there is no concrete evidence of Soviet involvement.</p>

You have made a fundamental point—that the fragmentation of nations is not just a problem for the subcontinent. It is a problem in Africa, of course. Even Britain has this problem in Ireland.

                            </hi>: The Soviet Union has its eyes glued to the coast. Afghanistan alone would not fulfill Soviet ambitions. India alone would not fulfill Soviet ambitions. I am not saying that the Soviet Union wants to dismember Pakistan. They want to win us to the Asian Collective Security Pact. The former Afghan government was not accepting that approach.</p>

                        <p>President DAUD of Afghanistan does not have roots in the coup which brought him to power.

                        <p>There is no use comparing European collective security to the proposal for Asian collective security. Europe may be ripe for that kind of arrangement, but Asia is not ripe for it. There are still territorial disputes and wars going on. There is a tenuous cease-fire in Southeast Asia. Asia is in a state of flux. The objective conditions for this kind of approach to security have not crystallized. We do not feel that any approach to Asian security should be spearheaded by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We do not see why others who have interest in Asia like the US should not be involved. The Soviets are unhappy about us. They are trying to ginger up Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>Iran agreed to a communique in which they accepted in principle the idea of Asian collective security. The Shah explained that he had only given in on the words and would remain cautious about the idea and about any practical steps. I told him that the principle itself was offensive to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>I know Chou En-Lai feels that the Soviets are concentrating on the middle of Asia—Persian Gulf, Pakistan and Iran—and then after directing everyone's attention to that area, Chou feels that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will hit China.</p>

                            </hi>: In the Persian Gulf, Pakistan has very good relations with the Emirate states. Pakistan also has good relations with the Arab states, even with the new messiah in Libya. Pakistan has had some pilots in Libya until they were asked to take off against the Sixth Fleet and we told them nothing doing.</p>

                            </hi>: Relations with Iran are good. It is something of a feat to have good relations with both Iran and with the Arab states.</p>
                        <p>But we do have good relations with Iran—the best of relations. I have great admiration for the Shah. However, there are one or two aspects of our relationship that we need to talk about. In the past we had contingency plans with Iran for Iran's help in case of trouble. But when trouble came, help did not materialize. Iran had to consider how the Soviets would react. It is very well for Iran to say that Iran will come to Pakistan's aid. However, this sometimes creates a bad reaction in Pakistan. Our people are a strong people, and they respond by asking why Pakistan needs Iran's aid. For the Shah to talk that way suggests that Pakistan is going to disintegrate tomorrow and Iran win bail us out. Instead of contributing to our ability, that kind of statement creates a feeling of inferiority.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I understand. Those offers of help should be made privately and executed publicly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Henry</persName>, when you go to State, I want you to tell them to knock off discussion of further dismemberment of Pakistan. I do not know whether there is much of a problem on that in State or not.</p>
                        <p>Our problem is that the attitude in the US is that Pakistan is essentially governed by military dictatorship, and there is a love affair between the American liberal establishment and India.</p>
                        <p>One of the things you can do here, Mr. Prime Minister, is to talk to people and to let them see that you are a liberal in your own right. Your record helps you here. You can speak not just as a spokesman for the interests of your country but as a leader of thought. The Indians have made their appeal in the US on the basis of a higher morality. But their actions have shown them to be something else.</p>

Sometimes your candor proves to be a detriment. But your credibility with the liberal establishment will be very helpful. You can help to develop more support in Congress for our helping you. In the military area, our hands are tied. We bit the bullet in the spring by returning to a policy of providing spare parts.

                            </hi>: We are aware of your Congressional problems. Thus we have not really pressed the military supply issue. We do not want to embarrass you or burden your position. But our need is really dire. Iran—and even a great power—has so many complications when it tries to go to the aid of another country. You can choose your time for acting, but who are we to say when we will need assistance. We need to be self-reliant.</p>
                        <p>We are your allies and will continue to be your good friends. But if Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are entitled to military sales, now that there is peace between India and Pakistan, perhaps we are entitled to the same. If we take an initiative with India to insure peace—we may even offer a reduction of military forces—we must have the psychological and political advantage of knowing that we can stand on our own feet.</p>
                        <p>Please consider our needs. It is your choice and your decision. But we believe we can appeal to you. We do have a case.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: There is total agreement with you on that. There was great agonizing in this office during the 1971 war. We were hopeful that we could have provided more. I know that many of our friends are concerned that the US initiative with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is so important that the US would not stand by its older friends. But as our declaration on avoiding nuclear war indicated, you can be sure that improvement of US-Soviet relations will never be at the expense of friends or third countries. Our Chinese friends must realize this too. I think they do.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: The Soviet leaders realize that we are not talking about a condominium. In our talks with Brezhnev, we have never given an inch on South Asia. On the contrary, in 1971 some <pb n="13" xml:id="d147-13" facs="d147-13"/>very stiff messages went to Moscow. <persName>Henry</persName>, do you want to describe the conversation we had in San Clemente with Brezhnev on this point?</p>

                            </hi>: We called the attention of the Soviets in 1971 to a letter from President <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> to President Ayub saying that we would help Pakistan if it were attacked by India. We told the Soviets that we regarded that letter as in full force and as applying to that situation in 1971. This was at the time when we received reports that the Indians were shifting their troops to move against Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>We also told the PRC that if they came into the war in support of Pakistan and if they were attacked, they would have our full support. As it turned out, they could not do this. The winter prevented them, and they were not ready. We have told Brezhnev that we would consider an attack on Pakistan in any form as inconsistent with the detente between us.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: As a footnote to our conversation in San Clemente, I referred to Soviet aid to India as one way the Soviets commit aggression through using third countries.</p>

                            </hi>: The President instructed me to tell Ambassador Dobrynin after the coup in Afghanistan that any outward projection of the Afghan crisis would not be in the spirit of detente.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I will tell GROMYKO the same thing. It is in the interest of world peace that the US try to have a modus vivendi with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviets sometimes don't appreciate what this means. It is also necessary for us to have a relationship with the PRC. Pakistan is a critical country. It is in the road to warm water ports. US interests are served by a strong and independent Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Henry</persName>, you may want to tell the Prime Minister about my conversation with Mao Tse-tung.</p>

                            </hi>: The President began his conversation with Mao by saying that it was not sentimentality but parallel necessities and commonality of interests which had brought the US and China together. The Chinese are an attractive people but they are not sentimentalists. In February, when I saw Mao again, he picked up this theme. When I go to China, we will synchronize our views further about our common interests in your part of the world.</p>
                        <p>In short, we see a need for detente.</p>

                            </hi>: Ironically, detente has made the Europeans more alert. Our strategy is to force the Soviets, if they do mischief, to do it from a position of peace so that we can mobilize domestic support for our response.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We fully recognize that it is possible to have the appearance of detente at the top with games being played underneath. In Afghanistan, for instance, the Soviets can say, “Who, me?” We are going to be watching very carefully and will not be taking anything on faith. But the Soviets have no illusions about how we feel.</p>

(2) I would also like to talk further about our flood needs. (3) Also, we want a port in Baluchistan. The Iranians are building a port at Chah Bahar. We need one on our coast. The Soviets are deeply interested in this coast and they have offered us to help with oil exploration, geological survey and that kind of thing. We would rather have a US presence. The port would be at Ormara. If the US is interested, there could even be a US presence there.</p>
                        <p>[At this point, Sultan <persName>Khan</persName> produced the attached map of Baluchistan, opened it up and showed where the port of Ormara would be.]</p>

                            </hi>: This is a map put out by the movement for an independent Baluchistan. You will see how the borders include areas of not only Iran and Pakistan but also a little area into the Soviet Union. Thus, the Soviets could say that they had given up a little bit to Baluchistan, too, but the main purpose would be to provide open access directly from the Soviet Union through Baluchistan to the coast.</p>

In 1971, considering what we were up against, we did about what we could. We used and will continue to use our influence with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They have to understand that they will place in jeopardy their new relationship with the US if they pursue subversive activities in this area. During the war in Vietnam, the real question came down to whether they wanted to jeopardize their relationship with the US by needling Hanoi to escalate the war. In conclusion, to recall what President Ayub said, I hope you will leave feeling that you can trust us and that we will have begun rebuilding the very delicate thread of trust and confidence.</p>

                            </hi>: Thank you very much for the banquet last night. You were very nice to my son. I slept well, but my son was so excited he could not sleep.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: The only young politician I can think of who might have been launched earlier was Winston Churchill. [Note: The President at the White House dinner the previous night had called attention to the fact that it was Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s son's 19th birthday. The President had introduced him and noted that some of his friends viewed him as a future Prime Minister of Pakistan.]</p>
                        <p>I want to tell you how much we all appreciate your eloquent toast. It was quite a contrast to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s toast when she was here [November, 1971]. I had said all kinds of kind things about how she had come in her own right, not as her father's daughter and not as a woman.</p>
                        <p>Boy, did we get a lecture! It was unbelievable.</p>

                            </hi>: It was the most ungracious toast I have heard since I have been here—or at any time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: She was trying to speak over the head of the President to the American people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: She even shocked the audience, which was basically pro-Indian.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: India is in a mess. We are not happy about it. If it were not for the characteristic generosity of Washington, India would be in real trouble. She will soon be on her knees in Washington.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I think she is beginning to get the message that American generosity is being handed out with more discrimination now than it used to be.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: They haven't got anything yet. The rupee negotiation is symbolic. Our purpose is to avoid a confrontation with the pro-Indians. Our policy has been to give on principle and then protract the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: We do not want to complicate your relationship with India. We want you to have a good relationship with India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We want to avoid encouraging India to think it has a free hand in any adventures in South Asia.</p>
                        <p>Now, I realize that one of the problems you wanted to talk about was debt rescheduling. I will talk to Secretary Shultz. I will be totally sympathetic. I think we can come very close to meeting your needs. I will bring Treasury along. If any arms need to be twisted, I will twist them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We have been studying this problem seriously. We are now at the point where we need to decide among two or three technical options.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We will be very forthcoming.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: If the Prime Minister would like, a member of his party could discuss these options with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Saunders</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes, we will do that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Shultz will not be rigid when I get done.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: I want you to know our strategy toward coming events. The separation of Bangladesh was a traumatic experience for our people. It is still a highly emotional issue. I have brought public opinion close to recognition several times and then have backed off. What I am trying to do is to take the air out of the issue. I am following a process of attrition on recognition. After the POWs return, I will give the impression that. I am in no hurry to recognize. We can then think more dispassionately. It will also become clear at that time that there is no compulsion from external forces. So there will be a little gap in time between the return of the prisoners and recognition. The reason I am telling you this is that your embassy may misunderstand this. If you receive reports from the embassy that I have backed off, I want you to understand what I am doing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: It won't be misunderstood here. You must move in your own way. There will be no pressures from the US. You have to bring your public along however you can.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I do not believe there will be any problem with our embassy. Our man there is quite sympathetic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: I agree. There is no problem with him. I just wanted you to understand in case various interpretations were put on the delay.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We will not pressure you. We want to be sympathetic. Bangladesh is a fact of life. But there is no rush about recognition. You have to bring your public along.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: We will do it. It is just a matter of time.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d148-04" facs="d148-04"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: The Prime Minister is doing a courageous job. The opposition is really quite substantial in some quarters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Something like this has to be done very deliberately.</p>
                        <p>The second point I want to emphasize—it is a sensitive area—is that we talked to the Shah about the question of transferring military equipment. Ambassador Helms will be visiting Pakistan in November. This is not just a junket. As you know, he understands how these things can be done. He was head of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. We want to be as helpful as possible through that channel within the limits of Congressional action. That is our policy.</p>
                        <p>I would not put it quite this way to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee people. But Ambassador Helms has the message.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We need to watch out for two things. We need to make sure that Congress does not cut off our ability to sell weapons to Iran, and we need to assure that Congress does not write further restrictions into the law against Pakistan. We have to navigate very carefully.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We are going to play this in a very low profile.</p>
                        <p>There is one very modest thing I want to tell you. I asked <persName>Henry</persName> whether there was anything we could do for you now, and he explained that your government has an interest in the helicopters that have been in Pakistan to help with the disaster relief effort. The helicopters are yours. We will play this very quietly. They will just stay on there. After all, I never know when it's going to rain in Pakistan. The relief problem will go on.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Henry</persName>, can we provide spares?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Once they are there, yes.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d148-05" facs="d148-05"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: The French are helping you with your arms?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: We are paying through the nose.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: The third point I want to make is also sensitive because a third country is involved. I will tell this to GROMYKO when I see him without making an issue of it. The most significant thing I said to you in welcoming you yesterday was that the integrity of Pakistan is a “cornerstone” in US foreign policy.China will understand this; the Soviet Union will understand this; India will understand it. I will repeat this to GROMYKO to make sure that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> gets the point.</p>
                        <p>We would like to know from you through your intelligence agency what is going on in Afghanistan—what the Soviets are doing there. If the Soviets continue massive aid to India, we will have to reopen the aid flow to Pakistan. But we do not want to mislead you on this point. Congress has imposed certain limitations, but who knows what the possibilities will be in the future.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will reiterate in Peking that Pakistan remains a cornerstone of our policy. We will do all we can to implement support for the integrity of Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>I would like to think that after your visit here we would be in the position of a few years ago of supporting Pakistan diplomatically. But we need communication from your government in order to know as much as we can about what is working to your disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>You can talk to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName>. He is a tough, no-nonsense fellow. He is not pro-Indian. He knows the Middle East, and he is totally the President's man. You will have an ambassador who knows what our policy is.</p>

                            </hi>: Can we talk to him about the Helms mission?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: Yes. I will brief him.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d148-06" facs="d148-06"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: He is a military man. He was a Brigadier General.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes. He was in Afghanistan some time ago. He is an excellent choice.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I have to give Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> credit for this. The state Department had its objections. They feel that <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> likes to have a good time a little bit too much. But we think he is a good man. When a career officer likes to have a good time, the State Department says that he is strengthening his contacts. When someone else likes to have a good time, they are opposed. But he is a good man. Let him have a good time [smiling].</p>
                        <p>The port proposal that you made intrigued me. We cannot say anything definitive on this today. We have not checked with the Navy. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will look into this. So far, we have put everything in that area on Diego Garcia. It might be useful to have access to a port as well.</p>

                            </hi>: There are two aspects to the problem. First is the construction. This is primarily a problem for AID. Second is the question of use. This second question becomes an issue only when the port comes into being. Even then, there is the difference between formal and informal use.</p>

I am morally certain that a US presence would be justified in terms of Pakistani interests. I don't may that it will not be an issue in Pakistan, but I believe I can manage it.</p>

                            </hi>: I am thinking about this port because I have to be concerned about what happens in Iran. We are commoners, not monarchs. In Iran, where are the institutions that will assure stability when the Shah goes from the scene? We in Pakistan wish him a long life, but we have to take into account what happens if he goes. That is why we think about a port in Baluchistan near the Persian Gulf. There are forces in Iran which could be loose, the situation changes. Perhaps we are a little more of the need to institutionalize our policies. A monarch's mind is a little different; he does not have to submit his policies to the rough and tumble of politics.</p>

                            </hi>: Our relationship with Indonesia is very good. There was a time when someone asked why the Indian Ocean should be called just the Indian Ocean. They suggested that it should be called the Pakistan-India-Indonesia Ocean. I told them that was too complicated—too long a name—but it illustrates the point that Indonesia is one of the major countries in the area.</p>
                        <p>The question of names is strange. We are frequently asked by our Arab friends why we call the Persian Gulf “Persian.” I always use that term because I have no interest in offending the Shah. I tell the Arabs to ask Alexander the Great why he named it that.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of our military supply relationship, I thank you for what you have told us about helping as much as you can. I feel embarrassed to complicate a problem for a friend. At the same time, there are ways that we can extend our collaboration. If Pakistan were not so badly menaced, I would not raise the question at all.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I appreciate your thoughtfulness in putting it that way. I wish more of our friends would do that. I wish it were possible for me to say more. But if I did, even the relationship we do have could be closed off.</p>

                            </hi>: There is one complexity about our using Iran as a channel. How can Pakistan get equipment that Indian intelligence does not learn about immediately?</p>
                        <p>The Indians will make a storm in a teacup whenever they learn about the slightest little bit of equipment coming into Pakistan. They feel that if they make a big enough storm they can prevent new equipment from being given to Pakistan. <pb n="9" xml:id="d148-09" facs="d148-09"/>When I was asked recently about the question of military supply by the press, I told the press to go and look at Soviet aid to India. India spends some $2 billion on arms while its people are starving. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> wants to improve relations with China, so who is she arming against? If India were to reduce its military budget, we could do the same.</p>

                            </hi>: These floods have really “knocked the mickey out of us.” We have explained our requirements. My concern is that if we are unable to meet some of them, the issues could become so difficult that the people would be out in the streets. We have never had a famine in this part of South Asia as they have had in Bengal and in India. Pakistan has always been the granary of South Asia. This is the first time we might face such a situation.</p>
                        <p>We asked for 1 million tons of wheat, but we understand your problems. If you could provide 500,000 tons or 600,000 tons, Pakistan will buy the rest. We also need 100,000 tons of edible oil.</p>

                            </hi>: We were aware of a request for only 40,000 tons of oil. We are prepared to go ahead with that very soon. We will look at your request for the extra 60,000 tons. On wheat we have found the 100,000 tons that we announced in response to the floods in Pakistan, but our situation is very tight. It is simply a question of availabilities. We will have to look at the problem again.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: It is surprising for the US to be in this position. For years we have had surpluses that we could not give away.

People remember the war there and the difficulty of 1971. People ask themselves whether Pakistan will survive. There are many private investors I think who would be interested in going intoPakistan, but they do have this question of Pakistan's survivability on their minds. What we can do is to help increase awareness that the government in Pakistan is a going concern and that it is not anti-private business. I think it is a good place to invest. If I had some money I would put it there.</p>

You can be helpful with the Gulf states—the newer states of the area. You can be helpful in the Arab world, especially in a place like Libya. And you have good relations with Indonesia.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">One final point</hi>: We have a very delicate problem in dealing with American opinion. Many opinion-makers give the impression that the US should withdraw from Europe and get out of Asia. However, more people support a US presence in Europe than in Asia, although the problems there may be closer to being settled than they are in Asia. I believe strongly that a US presence in Asia is every bit as important as in Europe. There is going to be a real gut fight between those who want us to get out of Asia and to disarm totally and those who do not feel this way. There are those who feel that the US must continue to play a strong role in both Asia and Europe and that a strong US role is essential to the peace of the world. Now, I wouldn't say that if we could go back to the situation that existed before World War I. But today it is certainly true, and we in this place will fight as hard as we can to preserve an American role. Our peaceniks are well intentioned, but I believe they are misguided. We are going to have quite a fight. We hope we will win it.</p>

                            </hi>: You cannot lose this fight. There is no difference between Europe and Asia. Today there is contiguity between the two and their problems are too integrated. It would be a disaster if the US were to end its presence in Asia—more so than if the Us were to withdraw from Europe. Europe has taken shape and is more likely to be able to hold its own. Asia has not. There is a need and a place for the US in Asia—from the world's view, from the Pakistani view, and from the viewpoint of US interest.</p>
                        <p>Presence can take different forms. The French are no longer in Asia as a military power, but they have come back in a different form.</p>
                        <p>I do not even see a basis for debate on this issue. I do not even read the New York Times editorials.</p>
                        <p>In short, Asia is not less important than Europe, and it would be a total disaster for the world and for the US if the US presence in Asia were to diminish.</p>

                        <p>We have made every effort to improve our relations with the Chinese. Our limited experience since 1950 is that once the Chinese are taken into confidence, even if they do not happen to like what you tell them., they are able to accept it. The one overriding factor is that they be taken into confidence.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum is a full record of the luncheon conversation between the Secretary and the India Foreign Minister on October 3. The first portion of this conversation involved only the principals, together with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, and has been covered in full in the summary reporting telegram.</p>
                        <p>The conversation opened with an exchange between the principals about some of the problems of dealing with an active press in both India and the U.S., in the context of the efforts of both governments to develop a better bilateral relationship.</p>
                        <p>Following the Secretary's observation that whatever happened in 1971 he believed we now have a basis for a good bilateral relationship, the Foreign Minister said India agreed and had no desire to focus on the past. That posture applied <pb n="2" xml:id="d149-02" facs="d149-02"/>also to India's attitude to Pakistan and Bangladesh. He told the Secretary that he had taken the initiative in New York to have a long private luncheon with <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> of Pakistan to review the entire range of their relationship. He had told <persName>Ahmed</persName> that he could not see why Pakistan felt the need to speak as negatively as <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> did in some respects during his <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> speech.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the view that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> had his own domestic problems to deal with. <persName>Singh</persName> thought this had been overstated and added his view that if people are informed about an issue they settle down and accept it. He recalled the bitter criticism from some quarters in India after the Simla agreement and how his government had persevered. Any effort to explain away or rationalize a decision or an action on other than factual grounds only created new difficulties. That was especially important in a democratic society like India's.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he agreed as a general rule that the direct approach was best, for both the general public and our relationships abroad. He asked what had bothered India in the <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> speech.</p>
                        <p>In response <persName>Singh</persName> cited particularly the emphasis on the 195 POWs. The Delhi agreement provided for tripartite talks on this problem and this was a great concession by Bangladesh. For Pakistan now to say that the 195 were being illegally detained and that there could be no question of recognition of Bangladesh in the interim was inconsistent with the Delhi agreement. All parties in Pakistan appeared to have accepted that agreement. <persName>Singh</persName> said he wanted to put them in perspective; the provision on the 195 POWs was part of the agreement; India had not wanted to be involved in the process but it was Pakistan that had insisted on it. The Secretary referred in this connection to the assurances that the U.S. had trained with respect to the prisoners and <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName> indicated he was aware of this and he was grateful.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d149-03" facs="d149-03"/>
                        <p>India did not want to make an issue-of any of this; it was bound by the agreement and regarded it as a forward looking step. Another problem that troubles India was <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s references to the idea of parity with India in the military field. He did not know quite what this meant. The Secretary interjected that as a veteran of SALT he was not always sure himself. He noted, however, that as between India and Pakistan a very different strategic situation existed, India had many more borders to concern itself with. <persName>Singh</persName> said that was correct, particularly its long Chinese border where, with 150,000 troops right on the border, it could not relax. The Secretary asked and got confirmation of this figure. <persName>Singh</persName> said that only on China's India border did there appear to be this kind of troop concentration. All its other borders were quite quiet. In several places on the Indian border, troops were patrolling in sight of each other. But he said there was satisfaction in the fact that since 1967 there had not been a single case of reckless firing. The Secretary expressed his impression that India's relations with the PRC were improving. <persName>Singh</persName> said he wished he could say so. However, they were not deteriorating and that was good. The Secretary noted that he would be going to Peking October 26-29. <persName>Singh</persName> asked for the Secretary's assessment of Chinese attitude toward India. The Secretary said he would be frank in response. Even now the Chinese regard India as an extension of Soviet policy and consider the August 1971 treaty as the equivalent of an alliance and as a part of the Soviet effort of encirclement. Therefore, the Chinese were extremely suspicious of such proposals as the Brezhnev security proposal. These, of course, were his, impressions and the Chinese would have to speak for themselves.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Singh</persName> then reviewed India's relations with China since the border crisis of 1962. From then until 1971, there had been no treaty of any kind with the Soviets so that to peg India's relations with China on what happened in 1971 was not to put it in proper perspective. The</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d149-04" facs="d149-04"/>
                        <p>Secretary noted that China had two complaints about India; the first with respect to the way border negotiations with India were conducted in the 1960's. On this the Chinese followed the Maxwell thesis. (<persName>Singh</persName> observed that Maxwell had indeed swallowed the Chinese line). The Secretary said that the second Chinese complaint had to do, of course, with the 1971 experience.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Singh</persName> said that with respect to the 1971 treaty the Chinese should not be unaware of India's true relations with the Soviets. They know it is not directed against them and in that context, if China uses this line, it could only be to justify a posture of hostility.</p>
                        <p>India was prepared to cooperate with China, as a big neighbor. It respected the concept of no interference in internal affairs. Nonetheless China kept referring to the presence of the Dali Lama in India as somehow inconsistent with this position. It was not. He was free to move about but not to engage in political matters. India was relaxed about China. It would not irritate them, but it was not going to be brow beaten by them either. It would follow a straight forward approach and would not join in any anti-Chinese efforts. He thought there was a good deal of evidence in the Department's archives to indicate that much pressure had been used against India at times to get India to join in an effort of containment of China. India had never accepted this and was not going to be roped into any effort such as this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Singh</persName> said it was difficult for him to see any basis for a clash of interest with the PRC anywhere in the region. In response to a query from the Secretary, he said this applied to Southeast Asia as well. India had no strategic concerns there; U.S. interests were more vital than India's in that area. In response, the Secretary recalled talking to Foreign Secretary Desai in 1962. He had told the Secretary that he <pb n="5" xml:id="d149-05" facs="d149-05"/>felt India did have a vital interest in Southeast Asia and thus wanted to keep it from falling under the domination of one power. <persName>Singh</persName> said Desai had been expressing support for the U.S. domino theory at that time. But to suggest that India had a direct national interest in that area that should cause a clash with China was not correct. India's interest was in stability there, since only Burma lay between that area and India.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the U.S certainly was not doing anything to foster disagreement. It took all opportunities to welcome good relations between Peking and Delhi, although this had not been A principle matter between us and the PRC. He recalled having told <persName>Singh</persName> in Delhi in 1969 that the U.S. interest in India's independence was very great and that an unprovoked Chinese attack would be taken very seriously. That position had not changed. <persName>Singh</persName> said he recalled that well and also his response at the time that this was a point that should be discussed between the President and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>This discussion on China ended with the Secretary suggesting that he and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> get together for luncheon following his return from Peking.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Singh</persName> asked for the Secretary's assessment of the PRC Foreign Minister's visit Tehran. The Secretary said that visit had not been geared at all to India; it had more reference to the Soviet position in the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> observed that this was reflected in public statements at the time, especially the reference to the problem of subversion in the area. That was clearly intended to underscore the Chinese concern regarding the Soviets. In this connection the Secretary asked whether there was any evidence of Chinese activity of this kind along India's borders; Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> affirmed that this was so, <pb n="6" xml:id="d149-06" facs="d149-06"/>both in propaganda and clandestine arms in the northeast area.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to the Persian Gulf. <persName>Singh</persName> opened by saying that India felt strongly that the U.S. interest and approach contradictory or different from India's interest. India did not interfere in that areas internal affairs; it had good business relations there and needed its oil supplies. The Secretary responded at this point that he saw be any clash in interests between India and the U.S. Anywhere in the area particularly if upheavals could be avoid the Baluchistan and Pushtunistan areas. These were the only trouble spots he could see. <persName>Singh</persName> responded that these were areas geographically separate from India; it had absolutely no contact with the leaders of those two areas, except, of course, long standing contacts with Ghaffar Khan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Singh</persName> introduced the Afghan situation by asking the Secretary's impressions, noting that he was scheduled to make a visit there on October 19-20. The Secretary responded that our contacts were still limited with the new leadership so that we would like very much to have <persName>Singh</persName>'s impressions after his visit. We do have the impression that the Iranians believe, and the Pakistanis as well, that to some degree the Soviet role had increased; there was also concern about the volatile nature of some of the Soviet trained military officers involved in the coup.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Singh</persName> then referred to Iran and asked somewhat rhetorically why the Shah needed all those aircraft. The Secretary observed that the Shah felt that, like India, he had a good many borders to worry about. The Secretary added (observing with a smile that he had only been on the job a week and that he had not yet learned as a diplomat to be less than totally frank) that he thought the Shah was quite concerned about India's intentions toward Pakistan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> added that if one viewed the scene as the Shah does from his balcony in Tehran, one would see perhaps why the Shah also worries about the Soviet presence in India, in Iraq, and now the new question marks about Afghanistan. At this point, Senator Percy joined the <pb n="7" xml:id="d149-07" facs="d149-07"/>luncheon and the Secretary noted that the presence of a Senator at this kind of working luncheon was a new development. For the purpose of conversations such as these, the Department treated Senators as a member of the Executive Branch!</p>
                        <p>The conversation resumed with respect to Iran, the Secretary saying that to the extent that Iran could be reassured of India's good intentions toward. Pakistan, the likelihood of transfer of any arms by Iran would be greatly reduced. <persName>Singh</persName> recalled the Secretary's policy statement on this matter in his confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Secretary affirmed that it was not U.S. policy to encourage transfers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName> then noted the growing interest of numerous Arab states also to acquire sophisticated arms and expressed concern that this could cause new tensions in the area. In response to the Secretary's query whether India was concerned about was concerned about Saudi Arabia's acquisition of arms, <persName>Singh</persName> said India was only in the sense that the escalation purchases generally in area could enhance the possibility of outside powers becoming involved. The Secretary said the U.S. was not interested in seeing a large increase in arms into the Middle East, especially not into areas like Libya and Iraq where they were bound to show up elsewhere in the Middle East eventually. <persName>Singh</persName> said that he would like to suggest serious consideration of one aspect of the matter; namely that large scale acquisition of arms by Iran would cause Arab states also seek arms and this could cause tensions. Therefore a moderation in the quantum of arms by the U.S. to Iran would help reduce their spread.</p>
                        <p>In response to a query by Senator Percy as to protection against trans-shipment of arms, the Secretary said we, of course, have no means of preventing transfer of non-U.S arms but with respect to equipment there were legislative provisions that preclude their transfer. <pb n="8" xml:id="d149-08" facs="d149-08"/>The Secretary then shifted the conversation to a discussion of bilateral issues, particular rupees. He noted this was now a Congressional problem, given the Byrd amendment. The Department took a dim view of this development, not only because of its possible impact for the rupee settlement with India but because of the risk of inflexibility that this kind of Congressional position would cause in our entire range of debt rescheduling problems. The Executive Branch would comply with the provisions of PL 480 law requiring 30 days review by the Agriculture Committees and this gave Congress sufficient chance to cancel or disapprove of proposed settlements.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary had talked to Senator MANSFIELD and we were now going to try to achieve elimination of the Byrd amendment in conference. This might mean a delay of same weeks before we could resume our discussions with India and he hoped that would be understood. If this effort, proves unsuccessful, we would still press ahead with the proposed settlement because we thought it was a good and fair one. Senator Percy concurred with this view, noting however that there were Congressional requirements that would need to be understood.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Singh</persName> said he was reassured by these comments. India had been troubled by this development but did not intend to intervene in any way. Senator Percy recalled that he had discussed the proposed settlement with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> as an important step in improved relations and she had taken a positive attitude. He reaffirmed his view that the conference route was best, noting that he had discussed this with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in his meeting on Saturday and he was of a similar view. He felt that if Senator MANSFIELD felt this way as well the problem could be resolved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then reaffirmed our intention to proceed with the settlement as a sign of our interest and good faith in building a better relationship. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> interjected that he thought it would be <pb n="9" xml:id="d149-09" facs="d149-09"/>best for the present if <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName> on his return to India could avoid public reference to this issue, perhaps limiting himself to an indication that he had been generally assured of the U.S. goodwill on this issue while he was in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Secretary also raised the debt rescheduling issue and told <persName>Singh</persName> we were prepared to go ahead with another annual exercise immediately. As for the future, he said that the unresolved issue of equivalent treatment as compared to debt relief provided by other creditor nations needed to be discussed sufficiently in advance so that an understanding could be worked out that would meet U.S. requirements.</p>
                        <p>Senator Percy made brief reference to the issue involving restrictions on U.S. post-doctoral scholars in India, expressing the view that this had been a most unfortunate development. He suggested that Swaran <persName>Singh</persName> might want to make public reference while he is in the U.S. to steps <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is taking on this matter. <persName>Singh</persName> responded that no restrictions presently apply, following the changed policy that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had just announced, and he thought India had gone a long way on this.</p>
                        <p>Senator Percy also asked how the <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> visit had been received publicly in India. <persName>Singh</persName> responded that with the exception of <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speech there had been no difficulty. The Secretary recalled that he had been very pleased to hear that in response to press questions concerning India's reaction to the President's reference to Pakistan's integrity and independence being a cornerstone of U.S. policy, the Indian Embassy had responded that this was even more an objective of India. He turned to Minister <persName corresp="#p_GE3">Gonsalves</persName> and recalled that it was <persName corresp="#p_GE3">Gonsalves</persName> who had taken this position. Senator Percy: “Marvelous” <persName>Singh</persName> added that he had also given formal expression to this position in his <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> speech.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d149-10" facs="d149-10"/>
                        <p>Senator Percy at this point recalled the Secretary's public statement that the U.S. was not going to be a major arms supplier in South Asia. He said he felt this statement reflected the strong view of the Congress. This prompted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> to note the recent transfer of six helicopters to Pakistan and to ask whether these were armed or unarmed. The Secretary responded that these were flood relief helicopters and added facetiously that every time there was a major flood in Pakistan there would be six more helicopters. He Assumed the Indians would now be starting to build dams like crazy. <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> said he hoped in any event that this was not an indication of other exceptions to policy to come.</p>
                        <p>In a discussion on India's food situation the Foreign Minister reviewed the problems facing India and the efforts it had made to meet the current gap in requirements. He made no reference to the Soviet loan of wheat. The Secretary reviewed the situation facing the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on foodgrain exports generally, noting that this was a new situation for us. It had never occurred to us before that we could sell too much wheat. Our whole experience had previously been to encourage a free market on a global basis to insure maximum opportunity for food availabilities. This situation no longer was the same, however, and it was now absolutely necessary fully to coordinate the food problem with other nations.</p>
                        <p>In a discussion of fertilizer requirements, <persName>Singh</persName> noted that India intends to try to set up at least 10 fertilizer factories in the next two or three years and would welcome help from the U.S. in this area. The Secretary responded that following a rupee settlement the U.S. would be ready to move ahead in other fields with India. Senator Percy noted the great importance of India's progress in self-sufficiency in food and thought the fertilizer area was one in which we could help.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d149-11" facs="d149-11"/>
                        <p>The conversation concluded with the Secretary proposing a toast. He thought that perhaps his colleagues had not in the recent past heard him express the depth of conviction he felt with respect to good U.S.-Indian relations. Not only did our two countries have no conflict in interests; we have strong parallel interests in areas such as peace and development. He had gained a new appreciation of the importance of our relationship by this constructive exchange of views. He proposed a toast to the friendship of the U.S. and India.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister responded in a similar vein, noting our commonality of interests trade and an open society. India had no ambitions for hegemony and would not impose its influence on anyone. It wanted good relations with both Pakistan and the PRC. India would seek to share U.S. burden of world peace by seeking peace in its part of the world. With the leadership the U.S. provides and the stimulation it provided, he was confident of success.</p>
                        <p>He then expressed a warm invitation to the Secretary to come to Delhi, directly or in connection with any other of his travels. He would find a warmth and openheartedness and, to use an American idiom, he would find that we can do business with each other. The Secretary said he gladly accepted the invitation and when his own schedule took better shape, he would take the liberty of suggesting a date to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>. Meanwhile our two governments could easily be in touch on a range of matters and he would welcome that.</p>

                        <p>India perceives itself as a major international power, but is viewed by many as a hollow and feeble state. It must give weight to its needs, as well as to its aspirations, in making its principal policy decisions.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>—India seeks security against the contingency of an attack by Pakistan, China, or both. It is concerned that these states might be aided by outside powers, particularly the US and Iran. India will ensure that it retains the strongest armed forces in the subcontinent, through domestic arms production and acquisition of outside — principally Soviet — sophisticated equipment. It has developed close ties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and receives strong political support from it against China. India could also explode a nuclear device if it so chose.</item>
                            <item>—India seeks considerable material (principally financial) assistance to foster economic development. On occasion it needs additional large amounts of food aid to prevent famine. India looks to the major non-communist countries for economic aid, and especially to the US for food.</item>
                        </list>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d150-04" facs="d150-04"/>
                        <p>India regards its political/military ties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as at least as important as economic ties with the Western nations. In any case it will seek to guard its independence of action with respect to any great power.</p>
                        <p>Despite a rising crescendo of domestic troubles, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> remains in firm control of the government and will continue to direct foreign policy, though it will often (if not most of the time) be a secondary consideration for her. She and any likely successor will pursue nationalist India-first goals.</p>
                        <p>With South Asian and Indian Ocean states, New Delhi will pursue varying approaches aimed at maintaining Indian preeminence in the region:
<list>
                                <item>—It will not try directly to control the affairs of such small neighbors as Sri Lanka unless it comes to believe that its security interests would require active intervention.</item>
                                <item>—India's relations with Pakistan will remain taut and subject to further strains for an extended period, but major hostilities now seem unlikely.</item>
                                <item>— The danger of Indian rivalry with Iran (though probably not of open confrontation) will increase. Mutual suspicions between Teheran (looking to the US, supporting Pakistan and hostile to Iraq) and New Delhi (looking to Moscow and extending its ties with Iraq) have risen.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sino-Indian tensions may ease, but basic disagreements will remain.</p>
                        <p>Ties between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and India will remain quite close. The two are linked by a limited security commitment and a shared antagonism to China. But India will not become a Soviet client; nor will it permit operational Soviet military forces to be based on Indian territory save in times of extreme national peril.</p>
                        <p>Indo-US relations are emerging from a period of strain to one of relative calm, but a number of specific points of contention will inhibit close ties. This will be especially the case with respect to financial matters. The US, as India's former largest aid donor and currently <pb n="5" xml:id="d150-05" facs="d150-05"/>as its largest creditor, will figure prominently in New Delhi's negotiations with the principal Western countries:
<list>
                                <item>—India now owes the US over $3 billion in hard currency of which it is chronically short. At the same time bilateral US aid programs are declining sharply, though there is substantial US assistance to India through such multilateral bodies as the World Bank. The issue of Indian debt repayment to the US will remain outstanding and difficult.</item>
                                <item>— Among other matters which could be at issue between India and the US are: US relations with Pakistan, with China, and with Iran; the disposition of US holdings of $900 million worth of rupees generated mostly by local sales of PL-480 commodities; Indian efforts to procure very large amounts of US food grains in the event of a monsoon failure; and the possible explosion of an Indian nuclear device, even as part of a peaceful uses program.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the broadest terms, the basic interests of the US and India — e.g., area-wide stability, peace, amicable bilateral relations — are in fact compatible, but the definition of these general objectives and the means of achieving them will often be the source of friction. Relations will frequently be clouded by accumulated suspicions, differing attitudes or by conflicting perceptions of each others' interests. In short, the areas of friction in the relationship are likely, for some time to come, to predominate over those conducive to harmony.<note n="8" xml:id="d150fn8" type="source">
                                <p>The Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, believes that this paragraph overemphasizes the potential for frictions between India and the US and fails to give sufficient attention to the opportunities for cooperation. He believes, therefore, that a more accurate assessment would read as follows:</p>
                                <p>Relations betweenIndia and the US will often be clouded and there will be issues on which the interests of each will diverge. But the US and India share common interests on a wide assortment of fundamental issues and, while we will often find ourselves at odds over the means to achieve common objectives, there will be opportunities to reach common positions or at least to keep differences manageable.</p>

                        <p>1. India's international role is an anomalous one and reflects that nation's peculiar strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, India is the world's second largest country in terms of population; its armed forces are the fourth largest. Only nine other states have a gross national product greater. Its large and diversified industrial plant produces commodities as complex asjet aircraft; it could make nuclear explosives if it chose to. India is now the principal military power in the Indian Ocean area, adjacent to petroleum supply routes from the Persian Gulf to the Free World. Its leaders have traditionally been prominent among the major spokesmen of the Third World. An Asian power, it figures importantly in the strategic calculations of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China. A major disruption or radicalization of India could have unsettling effects far beyond its own borders or even the Asian continent.</p>
                        <p>2. On the other hand, India can also be viewed as a hollow and feeble state. Its huge and rapidly growing population mostly lives in extreme poverty — now as throughout modern history. Its industry and its government are often characterized by inefficiency and ineptitude. It has been chronically dependent on foreign aid, not merely to generate economic development but also on occasion to avoid mass starvation. Its location gives it a kind of strategic isolation which can be argued to limit its importance to the US. Its role in international trade is not significant, and it exports no vital commodity like petroleum or copper.</p>
                        <p>3. Over the years, US policy has at times treated India as a force to be reckoned with and at others as one to be ignored. After a period of strain which developed during the Pakistani civil war of 1971 and persisted for some time afterward, US-Indian relations are entering a time of relative calm, with neither close involvement nor total alienation. Principal matters of bilateral concern will be economic—aid, debt repayments, food shipments and trade. Political and military issues will generally come in a broader multilateral context, e.g., Indian ties with the great powers, with the non-aligned countries, security problems in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf area, and relations with Pakistan and China.</p>

                        <p>4. The basic objectives of Indian foreign policies have long been matters of emotional dispute to many outsiders. For years, Indian espousal of non-violence and non-alignment between the contesting powers in the Cold War were taken at face value by many outside observers — particularly Americans and Europeans. When it appeared to Westerners that New Delhi was behaving differently, the Indians were accused by many of being hypocrites. Self-righteous denunciations by both sides became frequent. The invective has clouded India's relations with a number of Western countries. The Indians are in fact neither more noble nor more cynical than the peoples of most states. They will continue to advance what they believe to be their nation's interests with a calculating and unsentimental realism. They will also often continue to demonstrate a moralistic style that antagonizes many foreigners.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">1. MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> AND DOMESTIC CONSIDERATIONS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> remains in control of the central government. She will face domestic problems of so serious a nature that foreign affairs will often (if not most of the time) necessarily be a secondary consideration for her. Her popularity and domestic political strength have been eroding since reaching a peak in 1971 and early 1972. In the short term, she must cope with quite serious internal difficulties, including food shortages, inflation, a conspicuous failure to show progress in her program to “abolish poverty,” serious bickering in her own Congress Party, and widespread popular dissatisfaction. Disruptive political tensions have been manifested in major rioting, a police revolt in one state, and the collapse of several state Congress governments.</p>
                        <p>6. But Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s administration will probably continue to handle these problems without itself being seriously disrupted. While her position is weaker than it was two years ago, she has no serious rivals. Her control of the Congress Party remains effective. She retains a large and working Parliamentary majority and is likely to keep it until the next scheduled national elections in 1976.</p>
                        <p>7. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> tends to view with suspicion those capitalist nations whom she thinks impoverished and degraded such underdeveloped colonies as India. Like many Third World leaders she fears that independence did not end all colonial or “neocolonial” exploitation, and is concerned that the old imperial powers continue both to meddle in India's political affairs and to use their great economic power to enrich themselves at her country's expense. In this context, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> is particularly wary of the US, and tends to view Soviet positions as more congenial.</p>
                        <p>8. Though these biases do play some role in India's decision-making it is important not to exaggerate their impact. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s personal views are important, but Indian foreign policy would be essentially unchanged were another leader of the dominant Indian Congress Party serving as Prime Minister. Indian leaders are strong nationalists with residual suspicions of all foreigners. Respect for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has not eliminated suspicions of its motives nor prevented countless frictions in the relationship, which has led to considerable Soviet annoyance with Indian ingratitude and petulance. And wariness with the capitalist US and the West has not prevented numerous amicable and cooperative relationships in military, political, and economic fields.</p>
                        <p>9. In sum, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> and any likely successors are India-firsters, generally acting on and making decisions in accord with calculations of India's national interests. Roughly, India's foreign policy seeks military security against a threat from Pakistan, China, or both; to this end, it has developed close ties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—even at some cost to its relations <pb n="8" xml:id="d150-08" facs="d150-08"/>with the US and other states — and has worked for amicable relations with most of its immediate neighbors. It has also developed the largest and best-equipped armed forces in South Asia.</p>
                        <p>10. India's international relationships are determined by more than a quest for military security. It tries to expand its world influence by supporting measures which strengthen the role of Third World countries in international affairs. India also continues to seek — on acceptable if not favorable terms — as much material assistance from the developed powers as it can get. In this search, the US figures large, and the establishment of a cordial climate in dealing with Washington on these matters continues to be important to most Indian policy makers. But national security comes first.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">II. SOUTH ASIA</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. The 1971 Indo-Pakistani war conclusively demonstrated Indian military superiority on the subcontinent, a situation which is unlikely to change. Although India has long aspired to a position of preeminence in South Asia, it does not see its role as assuming direct political control over its independent neighbors. But it is far from indifferent to what goes on in these states; India has intervened actively in their internal affairs in the past and is prepared to do so again to protect what it considers its security interests. In 1949, in order to defend a strategic area in the Himalayas, it occupied Sikkim. In 1950 New Delhi executed a treaty giving it complete control over that state's defense and foreign affairs. In the 1950s and early 1960s India did intervene in Nepal; following the 1962 war with China, New Delhi adopted its still existent policy of friendship and non-intervention in Nepali affairs in exchange for Kathmandu's rigid neutrality in the Sino-India confrontation.</p>
                        <p>12. New Delhi's stance towards these mountain kingdoms serves as a rough model of its likely policies with respect to the other states of the subcontinent (except, of course, Pakistan). So long as New Delhi believes that small neighboring countries are relatively stable, troubled by no serious internal or external threat, and are not pursuing hostile policies, then it will leave them alone. On the other hand, if it felt its security interests threatened, it would feel compelled to take steps — supporting or opposing existing governments even by active military moves — to rectify the situation.</p>
                        <p>13. Within this context, New Delhi's relations with each of these states will vary considerably. The survival of Bangladesh — impoverished, troubled, and of considerable strategic value to India — will remain of great importance. So too will the continued rule of the popular Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">Sheikh Mujib</persName>. To this end, India will continue to give him political support and to advance some economic assistance. Relations with Nepal and Sri Lanka will remain considerably more distant in both the political and economic field. Barring what the Indians consider a dangerous or provocative development (for example, a Chinese-supported insurgency), they will also be generally amicable, despite quarrels over such issues as trade and repatriation of Indian nationals.</p>
                        <p>14. Pakistan is an entirely different matter. Indo-Pakistani antagonisms are so deeply rooted that the best the two can hope for is an uneasy modus vivendi. They will themselves remain prisoners of mutual hatreds and fears; they will exaggerate both the strengths and the hostile intentions of the other — often well beyond the limits of rationality. Islamabad sees the threat of India's overwhelming might being directed to the destruction of Pakistan — something that the Indians certainly do not now in fact seek. New Delhi does not see Pakistan's refusal to acknowledge Indian preeminence <pb n="9" xml:id="d150-09" facs="d150-09"/>in the region as a harmless, quixotic act. Rather it views Islamabad's quest for close ties with and support (especially military aid) from strong outside powers — particularly the US, Iran, and China — as posing a direct and dangerous threat to India itself. This concern is a principal determinant in India's foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>15. Ideally India would like Pakistan to be concerned principally with the stability of its own domestic affairs and not to try to challenge India on the regional or world scene. Thus Pakistan would reduce the strength of its armed forces, leave in abeyance (if not renounce) its Kashmiri claims, and forego political-military ties with the US, China, and Iran. In this situation India would refrain from interference in Pakistan's domestic affairs, show an interest only in preserving the status quo, and cooperate in matters — principally economic — of mutual benefit.</p>
                        <p>16. This Indian ideal solution to the endemic South Asian tangle is neither unreasonable nor far-fetched. Its achievement, however, will be time consuming and fraught with difficulties and may remain an impossible goal. Whether innate concerns on both sides can ever be subordinated to the quest of common aims and the desire to be good neighbors will remain problematical. Deep-seated fears and suspicions on both sides of the border will continue for many years to militate against the climate of mutual trust needed for such a relationship. Indeed, even when all immediate problems created by the 1971 war — e.g., the restoration of diplomatic and economic relations — are settled, relations will remain taut and subject to further strains for an extended period.</p>
                        <p>17. India and Pakistan fought major wars in 1965 and 1971; the latent antagonisms between the two countries continue to exist, and could in certain unpredictable circumstances bring on another Indo-Pakistani war. Some unforeseen event, e.g., an uprising in the Vale of Kashmir, could again lead the two disputing powers to or over the brink. As in the past emotional miscalculation and self-deception by the leaders of one or both countries could play a major role.</p>
                        <p>18. Another contingency, a long dormant dispute in the region, could also lead to heightened Indo-Pakistani tensions if not open conflict. The July 1973 coup in Afghanistan returned Muhammed Daud to power there. Until his removal in 1963, DAUD had led the Afghans in a hard line policy of confrontation with Pakistan. Demanding the creation of an autonomous or sovereign state of Pushtunistan out of large chunks of Pakistani territory bordering Afghanistan, DAUD's actions led to a rupture of Afghan-Pakistan relations, to some border skirmishing, and to fears of an international conflict. It is too early to say whether DAUD will revive the Pushtunistan dispute or whether India will involve itself in it (as it did not in the early 1960s). However, DAUD's initial comments on this issue, and India's very rapid recognition of his takeover have aroused apprehensions in Islamabad.</p>
                        <p>19. Beyond this, India might in certain cases feel compelled to intervene directly in internal Pakistani affairs. This will be highly unlikely so long as Pakistan remains free of serious domestic strife and its government is in firm control. But were that country to suffer sustained civil turmoil, Indian policy could well change. Thus if Pakistan were to erupt into a civil war on class or regional lines, and were this to continue for an extended and indecisive period, New Delhi could reluctantly come to feel that it would have to intervene to preserve regional peace and stability.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">III. THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THE PERSIAN GULF</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. While expanding its own naval forces in the South Asian region, India is actively trying to discourage a great power naval <pb n="10" xml:id="d150-10" facs="d150-10"/>buildup in the Indian Ocean. It has pushed for an “ Indian Ocean Peace Zone” and would like to limit deployments by both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> — or any other outside power. Barring that, it would prefer that no other country — particularly the US but also the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> — achieve a position of measurable naval superiority in the region. India has already decried the establishment by the US of communications facilities on Diego Garcia, though it has not so far been very noisy about the matter. Were Diego Garcia to be built up substantially as a naval operating base India would react with angry protests, but would probably limit its opposition to these denunciations.</p>
                        <p>21. Iran, which in the past was a country of peripheral importance in Indian foreign policy, has become a more central concern. Although the two nations have some important mutual interests including shared ownership of India's largest oil refinery at Madras, problems have dominated the relationship in recent months. The Iranians are concerned that India wishes to dismember or dominate Pakistan and bring Indian power to Iran's border. They are particularly concerned in the context of the Indo-Soviet treaty which Iran views as present or potential collusion against Iranian interests. The Indians worry that the massive increase in Iranian armaments and military power might be used to bolster Pakistan in a military confrontation with India.</p>
                        <p>22. The two countries' interests and concerns are beginning to overlap in a new and unfamiliar fashion. Both are extending their power and potential for influence. They probably will continue to gauge their relationship primarily by observing the actions of the other in third countries. Pakistan will be the principal area of contention. India will be hostile to any large-scale Iranian arming of Pakistan or any formal bilateral security agreement. It is concerned with the construction of a large new Iranian military base at Chah Bahar on the Indian Ocean and near the Pakistani border. Iran will be hostile to any Indian intervention, political or otherwise, which would impinge on Pakistan's sovereignty, or lead to the breakup of that country. Indeed the Shah publicly insists on his commitment to maintain Pakistan's territorial integrity.</p>
                        <p>23. Iraq is a second arena: Iran is worried that the similar Indian and Iraqi treaties with the Soviets may form the embryo of an Indo-Iraqi-Soviet alliance against Iranian interests. These fears are aggravated by the presence of a small Indian air force training mission in Iraq. India argues that its training mission has been in Iraq since 1960 and has never before caused complaints. Further, India's recent interest in Iraq has been primarily economic; in particular it is seeking, throughout the Persian Gulf, sources of oil of which it is critically short. Afghanistan is a third arena: Iran is worried that the Indians (and Soviets) may encourage Daud to heat up the Pushtunistan issue as a means of weakening Pakistan. India on the other hand will be concerned that Iran and Pakistan do not use their worry about intentions as an excuse either to cripple Afghanistan's economy or to intervene directly in its affairs.</p>
                        <p>24. Though there is some potential for danger in this Indian-Iranian rivalry, the prospects for a direct confrontation between the two alone are remote. Neither is innately hostile to the other; both will try to resolve peacefully any differences which may arise. The armed forces of both countries are large and impressively equipped, but neither can mount sustained operations very far from its own territory. The Indian Navy (including its one aircraft carrier) would find it impossible to conduct sustained activity in the Persian Gulf area. Nor could Iranian forces extend their <pb n="11" xml:id="d150-11" facs="d150-11"/>power to India in any meaningful way. But the two countries could find themselves in conflict in the contingencies of renewed Indo-Pakistani hostilities (say arising from Afghan-Pak fighting) or of civil turmoil in Pakistan. Both Iran and India would be strongly inclined to intervene in Pakistan itself were the other to do so.</p>
                        <p>25. The fact of Indian and Iranian extensions of their reach in overlapping areas could, however, more imminently be the source of sharpened rivalry involving several countries. India and Iraq — and possibly Afghanistan — supported by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could come to view themselves as irreconcilable opponents of the area's alleged US protégés, Iran and Pakistan. Such a perception would risk rivalry heightening toward hostility, and could stimulate each side to seek enhanced great power support. To some extent this has already happened and depending on the reaction of the great powers, could intensify—bringing on one more bone of contention between the US and India and providing the latter with a further sense of solidarity with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">IV. INDIA'S RELATIONS WITH THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> AND CHINA (2)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) A detailed treatment of Soviet policies toward India and South Asia is given in NIE 11-10-73, “Soviet Military Posture and Policies in the Third World,” dated 2 August 1973, SECRET</p>
                        <p>26. From both countries' point of view, Indo-Soviet relations are in a special category. To Moscow, India is the largest and undoubtedly the most important friend outside the communist world. India's role as a counterweight to China is a major if not the most important factor cementing the relationship. And New Delhi sees political and possible military support from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as integral to its security. No other major power offers the same combination of political sympathy for Indian objectives, shared antagonisms for some of India's adversaries, willingness to undertake a limited security commitment, and extensive military and (to a lesser degree) economic aid. The two are formally linked by the 1971 Treaty of Friendship. Even though it restricts the commitment to consultation and the pledge not to commit unfriendly acts against the other, the Treaty is of considerable symbolic importance as indicating the special nature of the relationship.</p>
                        <p>27. Since the 1950s, economic ties between the two countries have grown substantially. Total Soviet economic aid commitments over the years amount to about $1.6 billion (in contrast to over $9 billion from the US).(3) Nearly all has or is being spent on major public sector industrial endeavors such as steel mills. With declining Indian desire or need for more projects of this type, new aid extensions have halted, though old ones are still being drawn down. Trade between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and India grew sharply in the last decade, but it may have stabilized and could even decline somewhat. In 1972, some 15 percent of India's exports and 8 percent of imports were to and from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (when India's trade with other East European Communist countries is added the figures are 22 and 11 percent). Issues with respect to future Indo-Soviet economic arrangements will probably not have much impact on overall political relations. However much New Delhi would like more Soviet economic assistance, it values the relationship principally for its political and security aspects.</p>
                        <p>(3) The other Communist East European states provided an additional $367 million.</p>
                        <p>28. Soviet military assistances to India has been substantial. From 1962 to the present over $1.3 billion has been committed — usually on concessional terms — and mostly delivered. Indian dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in this field <pb n="12" xml:id="d150-12" facs="d150-12"/>is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The dependence is not complete; India still buys some weapons from the UK and France, and makes some of its own. Most Soviet military hardware delivered has been complex, sophisticated equipment like SAM missiles, submarines, jet fighters, and tanks. The Indians, who already produce most or all of their simpler military items, e.g., small arms, light artillery, and ammunition, hope eventually to manufacture their own sophisticated ones as well. They already have factories producing such items as tanks and aircraft. These still rely on key imported components, however, and are for the most part assembly plants. An Indian capability completely to manufacture its own complex weapon systems is probably many years away.</p>
                        <p>29. Despite this tangible dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for weapons, India is by no means a Soviet client. The Indians do feel the need for Soviet military assistance and for political support against China. But as in their refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>) or to provide Soviet-controlled shore facilities for Russian naval forces, they resist Soviet urgings when they feel that acquiescence would not be in their interests. Save in time of extreme peril to the Indian nation, New Delhi would not permit operational Soviet military forces to be based on its territory.</p>
                        <p>30. China is the most important determinant of Indian-Soviet relations. The worse the relations are between India and China the more need India feels for close Soviet backing. A return to the Sino-Indian intimacy of the 1950s now appears as a most unlikely prospect. India will still suspect a Chinese/Pakistani axis (supported openly or secretly by the US) directed against it, and it will continue to look to Moscow for, and get, support against Peking.</p>
                        <p>31.China is concerned that the political and military relationship between India and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> represents an enlarged Soviet threat to China. Peking has committed itself to the durability of the <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> government and has strongly supported slamabad's strategy regarding the pace of recognition of Bangladesh. But within the limits of these mutual suspicions there will be some scope for shifts in Indian and Chinese policies with respect to each other. Thus Peking and New Delhi were, prior to the 1971 Indo-Pakistani crisis, moving towards some easing of tensions. They will probably do so again, particularly if the current India/Pakistan/Bangladesh impasse is finally resolved. Even if some appearance of outward Sino-Indian cordiality is achieved, New Delhi and Peking will remain basically wary of each other politically and will increasingly find themselves competing for markets and products of the industrialized countries.</p>
                        <p>32. In these circumstances, the relation between India and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will persist as something less than an alliance but more than a normal friendship. Soviet dissatisfaction with India's economic performance, with its insistence on non-alignment, Indian xenophobia, complaints about the quality of Russian military equipment, and opposition to any substantial growth in Soviet naval strength in the Indian Ocean will serve, among others, as continuing points of friction. India and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue to share so broad an area of interest that they will generally wish to cooperate with one another. But where their interests diverge, India will continue to take positions different from those of the Soviets.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">V. UNITED STATES-INDIAN RELATIONS: PRINCIPAL ISSUES</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>33. India's cultural, social, and economic ties with the major non-communist countries (West European countries, Japan and the <pb n="13" xml:id="d150-13" facs="d150-13"/>US) are close. The bulk of the economic aid India now receives comes from them. Most of its trade (both imports and exports) is with them. Ties with the UK are especially good. English remains the lingua franca of the political and economic elite, and India remains firmly in the Commonwealth. The British tradition of democracy and rule by law has struck deep and impressive roots. With some exceptions India's political relations with most of these countries reflect economic and cultural realities. Acrimonious disputes are not common; dealings are business-like; there is neither intimacy nor hostility; disputes only occasionally take on political or emotional overtones.</p>
                        <p>34. Indo-American relations are a conspicuous exception. Over the past 25 years, there have been wide swings from a close working relationship through a state of mutual indifference to considerable tension. At the present time,India and the US are emerging from a period of strain into one of relative calm. But mutual cordiality is hardly the order of the day. Indeed there are major obstacles to the development of close relations betweenIndia and the US.</p>
                        <p>35. A number of specific points of contention emerge when US-Indian relations are considered. Whatever the current stated policies, many Indians continue to fear or suspect that the US is, in some manner, supporting Pakistan at India's expense. The US-Chinese detente and the Iranian arms buildup have excited Indian apprehensions and made them concerned to retain good ties with the Soviets. Certain disagreements derive from opposing basic views. For example, India, as one of the most important components of the underdeveloped world, presses for measures favoring the less developed countries at the expense of the richer ones, especially the US.</p>
                        <p>36. In addition, a brittle emotional climate remains in India itself with respect to dealing with Washington. Some Indian leaders have innate suspicions that the US in an aggressive capitalist neocolonialist power basically hostile to India. While high-level accusations of anti-India <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> conspiracies are no longer condoned by Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, American officials, scholars, and businessmen in India still find, on occasion, difficulties and obstacles placed in their way. The Indian Government continues to criticize (though in more muted terms) US activities in Southeast Asia and the US stand in the Arab-Israeli dispute.</p>

                        <p>37. The US has proposed several economic topics for discussion with the Indians: the disposition of US rupee holdings, aid and repayments, bilateral trade, and investment matters. The outcome of each of these discussions will determine the atmosphere for succeeding ones.</p>

                        <p>38. Negotiations have begun on the disposition of the $4.5 billion equivalent rupee claims of the US in India. Of these, some $900 million equivalent is on deposit, unspent, in a US account in an Indian bank. These rupees have resulted from agreements with India providing for Indian repayments in rupees rather than hard currency of US loans and PL-480 agricultural sales to India. Except for operating costs of the US Embassy these rupees generally cannot be spent without New Delhi's approval; nevertheless, the US could continue to use rupees for its own operation in India indefinitely. New Delhi, however, has viewed with concern the potential for US influence over the Indian economy which it sees these rupees providing.India was therefore, pleased at a US initiative to negotiate a large reduction in these holdings.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="d150-14" facs="d150-14"/>
                        <p>39. The US has proposed that India repay the $2.4 billion in principal due on outstanding debts with the US retaining $1 billion equivalent and granting the remainder to India. If the Indians choose to accept the US proposal, a rupee settlement could conic very soon. Otherwise, the pace of the entire economic dialogue will be much slower.</p>

                        <p>40. India has been receiving aid from noncommunist and communist countries for well over a decade, mostly in the form of loans. As of April 1971 India had a total external debt of some $8.5 billion; these obligations have grown; so have scheduled debt repayments and net foreign aid to India has fallen sharply. Thus in 1972-1973, foreign aid disbursements from all sources to India totaled $895 million but debt repayments of $682 million gave India a net aid transfer of $213 million.(4)<note n="4" xml:id="d150fn4" type="source">The details of India's international financial positions are discussed in the Annex.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>41. There are important potential points of Indo-US friction in international financial issues. The US has been the principal donor of aid to India in the past. It no longer is, and future US aid programs to India are very much open to question. But it remains far and away India's principal international creditor, being owed, in hard currency, well over $3 billion. Most, though not all, US assistance has been as a member of the Aid to India Consortium.(5) Since the mid- to late-1960s, the Consortium has been providing between $1-$1.5 billion annually in financial assistance to India; at that time the US contribution was roughly 50 percent. By the end of 1971, US assistance had declined to $200-$300 million a year. It was then suspended; $88 million in uncommitted funds were frozen. In the spring of 1973 the $88 million was released for Indian use, but no new pledges have been made. Major domestic uncertainties, including public and Congressional dissatisfaction with aid, hang over future US assistance programs of any magnitude.<note n="5" xml:id="d150fn5" type="source">The Consortium includes Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK, US, the World Bank, and the International Development Association (IDA). The Consortium is neither a supernational body whose decisions are binding on its members nor an institution engaging in aid programs of its own. Rather, it provides such expert economic services as analyses and recommendations, and a forum for mutual consultation and coordination of the aid donors on the one hand and the Indians on the other.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>42. India's heavy debt obligations to the US remain, however. Without new increments of US assistance or debt rescheduling, the bilateral US AID program to India will continue to entail a net bilateral transfer of resources from the recipient to the donor as occurred in 1972-1973. In the spring of 1974, India will request long-term debt relief of perhaps $1.5 billion from Western aid donors. The US response will of course be of major importance to the future course of Indo-American relations. Declines in the levels of bilateral US aid to India in the past two years have been roughly compensated for by increases in commitments by the World Bank and the IDA, multinational organizations in the Consortium, much of whose funds come originally from the US — thus making the US in fact a net donor of aid to India. This reflects in part a shift of disbursement of US aid from bilateral to multilateral channels. In the period April 1971-March 1973 the World Bank and the IDA made new aid commitments to India totaling about $780 million. In IDA's case this was 40 percent of its total loans to the underdeveloped countries. Some aid donors including the US have questioned whether India should retain its large share of IDA loans.</p>
                        <p>43. It is in these and other multinational bodies that many US-Indian negotiations on financial issues are likely to take place in the <pb n="15" xml:id="d150-15" facs="d150-15"/>future. The questions of new increments of Consortium assistance, of debt relief, and of the allocation of new Special Drawing Rights (SDRs — or their replacement) issued by the International Monetary Fund will be the principal ones. There is ample room for disagreement. India wants to maintain present levels of World Bank and IDA assistance, to get debt relief from the Consortium states and to have all new SDRs allocated to the underdeveloped countries of which it is so prominent a member. Most Consortium members take a more favorable stand to India's claims and have agreed to more aid. The US, to a greater or lesser degree, has been in opposition to the Indians in these matters. These differences could be continuing sources of difficulty, especially if an extreme balance of payments stringency — say resulting from a severe drought or major international dislocations — should force India to seek a debt moratorium.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Issue of Emergency Food Needs</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>44. India, with its huge and growing population, has had periodic food shortages at least since independence.<note n="6" xml:id="d150fn6" type="source">Despite the well-publicized - and very real — achievements of the Green Revolution (i.e., the expansion of grain output by use of improved seeds, controlled irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides), Indian agriculture remains critically dependent on the weather. And the monsoon rains remain unpredictable and variable. Major failures do occur every few years and bring on food shortages. Two consecutive monsoon failures, as occurred in 1966-1967, can bring on a near disaster, with the threat of severe famine which can be averted only by heavy imports. (In 1967 alone, India received 8 million tons of US PL-480 food grains.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>45. The contingency of New Delhi's seeking a new form of concessional sales or grants of US food in future years of crop failures is a very real one. Indian officials now talk of buying more than 3 million additional tons for delivery in 1973, and are seeking concessional terms for much of this amount. But were there a series of monsoon failures, India's future food import needs would skyrocket. Most of the enormous amount needed, if it were available at all and could be shipped, could only come from the US. India could not afford to pay for such huge quantities of food on commercial terms even by wiping out its reserves of hard currency.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Issue of Indian Nuclear Weapons</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>46. India has the technology and know-how to set off a nuclear explosion. It could do so soon after a decision to go ahead. Depending on how far preliminary work had gone, India could explode a device anywhere from a very short time to as much as a year after the order is given. India could then fairly quickly, if it chose to, make a dozen or so additional nuclear devices using existing stocks of plutonium. Were India to conduct a test (almost certainly underground) in the next several years, it would label it only a part of a peaceful uses program. At the same time, India would derive the political benefit of being known as a nuclear power; neighboring states would have to be concerned that New Delhi might have other devices — which could, in fact, be used as weapons.</p>
                        <p>47. At least during the 1970s, however, India would be unlikely to opt for the development of a credible advanced nuclear weapons and delivery system. Such a program would show few results for several years, would be very expensive, and would arouse domestic political criticism. If adverse domestic opinion seemed to moderate, and if Indian capabilities with respect to nuclear and missile technology <pb n="16" xml:id="d150-16" facs="d150-16"/>developed considerably further, this course, say by 1980 or 1985, might appear more attractive to New Delhi.</p>
                        <p>48. The pros and cons with respect to conducting a test labeled as a peaceful nuclear explosion would be much more closely balanced. The chances are roughly even that New Delhi will carry out such a test during the next several years, the pros and cons varying with events at any specific time. In any case, it will hold the option open. India would view entry into the nuclear club as a means of achieving a more influential role internationally. Achieving this would enhance the Indians' own sense of self-esteem and would be popular at home.</p>
                        <p>49. At the same time Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> would have to reckon with some adverse domestic and foreign reactions to such a move. Criticism from various elements in India that all nuclear explosions are evil, and that a test would only lead to more costly weapons programs could probably be contained by official assurances as to the limited, peaceful nature of the program. The same cannot be said of reactions from foreign countries. NeitherPakistan nor Iran, for example, would be easily prone to accept such assurances, and both would turn to the US for additional support. New Delhi is aware that even a peaceful test would bring forth adverse reactions from most if not all the principal world powers from whom India receives political, military, technical, and economic assistance.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">India and South Asia</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>50. US/Pakistan relations will continue to be matters of concern to India, and will vitally affect its image of Washington's policy with respect to the entire subcontinent. Islamabad will continue to seek US support; it will almost certainly renew its efforts to get additional military aid. This in itself will inspire suspicion in New Delhi; any large new shipments of US military supplies to Pakistan, either directly or, say, via Iran, is likely to place very severe strains on Indo-US relations. Another Indo-Pakistani war, or Indian intervention in a Pakistani civil war would trigger an international crisis of serious dimensions perhaps involving Iran, China, and other outside powers including the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>51. Possible direct Indian military intervention in certain of its other neighbors would not necessarily be a source of friction with the US, and depending on the circumstances might well reflect compatible policies. For example, Indian support for the Sri Lanka Government during the extremist 1971 insurrection there and its preparations for major involvement if required caused no problems. Nor would a military move into a troubled Nepal or Bangladesh be likely in most cases to create serious difficulties for the US.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">VI. INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES: PROSPECTS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>52. Developments inIndia itself could affect its ties with the US and other countries. India's weaknesses, its great poverty, severe caste and class barriers, regional antagonism, and widespread public unrest are manifest. Though Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s position seems secure until Parliamentary elections (now scheduled for early 1976), her sudden death could bring on an era of acute difficulty, and even turmoil. So could her defeat, without the selection of any viable successor in 1976. Even Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> might find India's domestic difficulties too great to cope with and become gravely weakened. In any of these contingencies, the resulting governmental instability could lead to strains in India's international relations. <pb n="17" xml:id="d150-17" facs="d150-17"/>And in the unlikely event that this huge country were weakened to the point that it became an object of concern or temptations to its neighbors and the great powers, the international community, the US included, would have a serious crisis on its hands.</p>
                        <p>53. In the broadest terms, the basic interests of the US and of India — e.g., area-wide stability, peace, amicable bilateral relations — are in fact compatible, but the definition of these general objectives and the means of achieving them will often be the source of friction. Relations will frequently be clouded by accumulated suspicions, differing attitudes, or by conflicting perceptions of each others' interests. For example, while both are seeking to improve bilateral relations, the settlement of India's accumulated debts to the US may prove difficult to resolve. Heavy US support of Iran in the strategic, oil-rich Persian Gulf area will also periodically arouse the suspicions of an India gravely concerned about the already close ties between Iran and Pakistan. In short, the areas of friction in the relationship are likely, for some time to come, to predominate over those conducive to harmony.<note n="7" xml:id="d150fn7" type="source">(7) The Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, believes that this paragraph overemphasizes the potential for frictions betweenIndia and the US and fails to give sufficient attention to the opportunities for cooperation. He believes, therefore, that a more accurate assessment would read as follows:</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>53. Relations betweenIndia and the US will often be clouded by accumulating suspicions, differing attitudes and conflicting perceptions of each others interests. Moreover, on issues (such as the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and debt rescheduling) which divide developed, world powers and the developing regional powers, US and Indian interests will continue to diverge. But the US and India share common interests on a wide assortment of issues ranging from the most fundamental (e.g., the development of stable, independent, and democratic governments in Asia and elsewhere) to more day-to-day concerns (e.g., narcotics, terrorism and hijacking). Not least of these shared interests is a resolution of the South Asian problems remaining from the 1971 conflict toward which India has made significant contributions. The US and India will, as in the past, often be at odds over the means to achieve common objectives but there will also be opportunities to reach common positions or at least to keep differences manageable.</p>

                                <item>To a considerable extent, India has been able to repay its debts to the non-communist, Consortium countries through the receipt of new increments of assistance from them. At the present time, there is substantial Consortium (and some US) aid still in the pipeline, i.e., money pledged and available but not yet spent by the Indians. The figures are instructive. On 1 April 1973, the total Consortium pipeline had about $1.6 billion in it. The US component of this, including the recently released $88 million, was roughly $124 million. In the period April 1973-March 1974, India is scheduled to repay all Consortium members $573 million and annual repayments will continue to rise. In 1973-1974, India will owe the US $129 million, and annual repayments are scheduled to rise through most of the 1970s. Without new increments of US assistance or debt rescheduling, the US AID program to India will continue a net bilateral transfer of resources from the recipient to the donor.</item>

                                <item>This actually happened the previous year; in the period April 1972-March 1973 (during which time funds were frozen) there was a net transfer of $47.4 million fromIndia to the US. This was also true in the same year of the World Bank and several other countries including Austria, Belgium, Italy, Japan, and The Netherlands. Their overall total of net transfers was slightly higher than that of the US. But as noted in the text, declines in the levels of bilateral US aid to India have so far been roughly compensated for by increases in commitments by the World Bank and the IDA.</item>

                        <p>The attached airgram reports that <persName corresp="#p_JR2">Rikhi Jaipal</persName>, India's Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (<gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>) at Vienna believes there may be increased Indian interest in the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_JR2">Jaipal</persName>'s reasons, with our comments, are listed below.</p>
                        <p>(a) India (except for a few diehards) realizes it can't spend the money for sophisticated delivery systems even if it developed a nuclear weapons capability;</p>
                        <p>(b) There is no serious Indian interest in developing an indigenous capability for India's own peaceful nuclear explosives.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_JR2">Jaipal</persName>, whether intentionally or not, avoided reference to the hard core of hawkish sentiment in India for leaving open the option of developing a nuclear strike force. Although the great and increasing cost of a convincing nuclear deterrent may have led some Indian strategists to wonder whether this would ever be a sensible option, it has not undercut politically relevant interest in the nuclear option. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s Government has contained this political problem by emphasizing India's interest in an indigenous peaceful nuclear explosive capability while eschewing interest in nuclear weapons. It is highly unlikely that in the face of the small but vocal get-the-bomb lobby the Indian Government will now begin to evince disinterest even in peaceful nuclear explosions.</p>
                        <p>The Indian Government holds off pressures to go ahead with a peaceful nuclear explosion by pointing out, inter alia, that progress in useful economic applications of such explosions has been slow. This is true. The US (and the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>) do not recognize a difference between a so-called peaceful-nuclear-explosive device and a bomb.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d151-02" facs="d151-02"/>
                        <p>(c) The Canadian refusal (because India is not a party to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>) to export certain key items for the Madras reactor has set back the Madras program three to four years. Our Ambassador at Vienna gathered that the problem of more difficult access to foreign nuclear technology and equipment purchases was becoming a major concern of the Indian Government which was coming to realize that failure to ratify the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was adding to the difficulties of bringing nuclear power to reality.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Comment</hi>: Perhaps some Indians are starting to recognize that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is beginning to bite non-parties right where it was intended to. (Article III [2] says that no <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> Party will provide fissionable material or equipment for making or processing it to any non-nuclear-weapon state unless the fissionable material will be under safeguards. The Madras project is not safeguarded.) However, we have detected no indications that India is reconsidering its position on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> in light of the Canadian decision or difficulties with its nuclear energy program.</p>
                        <p>(d) The only outstanding concern of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> with respect to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was Article VI—nuclear disarmament. Real progress in carrying out Article VI of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> might offer the opportunity for a change in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policy toward ratification.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Comment</hi>: This is nonsense. The basic concern of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> with the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> is that it is discriminatory; that it divides the world permanently into nuclear powers that count and non-nuclear-weapon states that don't; that it offers no solid guarantee against nuclear blackmail of non-nuclear-weapon states; that non-nuclear-weapon states have to help finance their own safeguards; that even though the Treaty promises full peaceful benefits of nuclear explosions to the non-nuclear-weapon states, the only way to really get these benefits is to develop the technology yourself; etc., etc.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of Article VI was to give the impression of more balanced Treaty obligations by committing the nuclear power parties to nuclear disarmament. The US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> claim they are doing all they can in this regard through SALT. Others point out that the nuclear arms race charges ahead. The dynamics of those counterclaims extend well beyond the framework of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. Saying you won't become a party to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> until there is progress on Article VI can be equivalent to saying you have no intention of becoming a party.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d151-03" facs="d151-03"/>
                        <p>Article VI obliges the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> Parties to continue negotiations on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament. There have been no such negotiations since 1964-65 and we have no interest in resuming them. It took us five years to get the Soviets off that wicket and into serious arms control discussions. The Indians, as they became aware that we and the Soviets in our dedication to arms control were cooking up an <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> to bite the non-nuclear-weapon states, became the most vociferous supporters of work on a general and complete disarmament treaty, i.e., a debating exercise. It was specifically to entice India that we stuck the reference to negotiations on such a Treaty into Article VI of the NPT. But they were not enticed.</p>
                        <p>(e) It might be wise to invite certain non-parties to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, such as India, to attend the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> Review Conference as observers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Comment</hi>: The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> calls for a review conference of parties to the Treaty five years after its entry into force. The <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> entered into force in March 1970 so the review conference should be in '75. The idea of inviting non-parties as observers is likely to be given careful consideration (by the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the first instance) next year. If you invite some it is difficult not to invite all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members. This would include the more hysterically anti-<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> countries (like Brazil) who would throw all the sand they could into the gears. People in Washington will remember that India's role in the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> negotiations was unhelpful in terms of US objectives and will be quite suspicious about what India would try to do at the review conference. (Secretary Trivedi, then the Indian negotiator, was a real thorn for us.) On the other hand, we may well want to include some of our allies who are signatories to the Treaty but not yet parties. In any event, this issue will be decided later in light of a broad complex of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> issues. We see nothing we can add from here about the merits of inviting India and others.</p>
                        <p>Having brushed aside so much of what Jaipal said, we remind ourselves that any serious indications of a changed or evolving Indian attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> would be of great interest to Washington. We intend to follow up in our contacts here to see whether we can detect any changes. We will also be working on an in-house review of developments in India's nuclear program and in attitudes toward that program to see whether we have anything worth telling to Washington.</p>

                        <p>This subject has been chewed over and over in recent years —particularly in 1972 when the Japanese touched off a rumor that the Indian blast was just a month or two away. We have noted no changes in Indian policy statements on nuclear issues but have dutifully reported all such statements. Nor have we noted any significant changes in the undercurrents of popular or official attitudes. Even so, we think that toward the end of the year it may be useful to send in a report —even if it were just to signal to Washington that indeed there has been no change.</p>

                        <p>S</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I want you to know that the United States appreciated Indian actions at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on Cambodia.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “India is glad the issue has been postponed for a year and hopes this period will provide time to resolve the problem.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “How had India figured in your talks with China?”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I went over this with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>, but will be glad also to repeat it for you. India did not play a major role in the Peking talks. The Chinese expressed extreme distrust of India's relations with the Soviet Union and of the Asian collective security scheme. They also expressed considerable distrust of Indian sincerity in seeking better relations with China. However, they did not look for occasions to go into great detail as on previous visits. I told the Chinese we thought India was prepared to normalize relations with China and also that India was conducting its own foreign policy and not serving as an extension of the Soviet Union. That was about all that was discussed.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “What about Chinese policy toward Bangladesh?”</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d152-02" facs="d152-02"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “The Chinese indicated they will follow Pakistan's lead; the timing of recognition would be entirely dependent on Pakistan. However, the Chinese think that over the longer run they have the best chances in Bangladesh.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “We disagree about Chinese prospects in Bangladesh. We do not believe pro-Chinese elements are strong, especially because of China's unfriendly attitude toward Bangladesh.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “With regard to US policy, now that Bangladesh exists, we are on India's side. We want the country to be a viable and progressive entity.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “We agree that there is no conflict of interest between the US and India on Bangladesh.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “None whatsoever; we are willing to cooperate.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “Recent Pak policy statements were somewhat disturbing, particularly <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s remarks on Kashmir, which India regarded as inflammatory and in violation of the Simla Agreement, where both countries agreed that the Jammu and Kashmir problem would be settled peacefully. I wanted to bring these statements to the Secretary's attention. In this connection, were Indo-Pakistan relations discussed with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> during the Secretary's recent visit to Islamabad?”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “There was very little time spent in Islamabad, only overnight. The talks with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> were mostly on the Middle East situation. There was a little on China and very little time about India. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> had made no specific complaints about relations with India, but was concerned about what he considered Pakistan's military weakness vis-à-vis India.</p>
                        <p>“Turning to our relations, we appreciate your Foreign Minister's December 6 remarks in Parliament. These reflect our own views. You keep asking where you fit in US priorities. The importance we attach to a country does not need to be reflected in constant activity—maybe the US and India do not have that many problems. I will be approving the rupee settlement later in the day. Indo-US relations are steadily improving, without peaks, but also without valleys. We remain more than ready to hear any concrete Indian ideas. I am willing to exchange political <pb n="3" xml:id="d152-03" facs="d152-03"/>views here with a representative of the Prime Minister should she send someone or to avail myself of the Foreign Minister's kind invitation to visit Delhi sometime during the next year. Please tell your Foreign Minister and Prime Minister that we see no obstacles to better relations.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “India reciprocates the Secretary's views on relations. It does not expect spectacular results. If the rupee settlement goes through, we can then go on to other things. Once the rupee problem is out of the way, India envisages improvement in trade, cultural relations, scientific and technological cooperation and possibly setting up binational commissions.</p>
                        <p>“One minor point has arisen in the rupee negotiations. At the last minute, the US Embassy has asked for an extra $15 million to be transferred to the so-called Cooley account. India hopes this can be dropped.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I am uninformed about this” (as were Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_LLB1">Laingen</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KD3">Kux</persName>).</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “When I talked with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> during the Romanian reception, the President was good enough to mention he hoped to see me soon but had been very busy. I told the President that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> and the Secretary were both working for better relations with India.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I hope you also told that to the liberal press.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “I want to call your attention to the December 7 New York Times editorial which spoke of India's tilting toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We do not know on what basis the editorial was written.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “Do not be overly concerned with such articles. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> thinks Indian policy is as discussed at Your dinner the previous week. We are not panicked by friendly Indian association with the Soviets.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “We do not think the Soviets are panicked by improving relations between India and the US.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “On the question of paying attention, you should know that the Indian Embassy dinner was the only such social occasion I have attended since taking office.”</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d152-04" facs="d152-04"/>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “How soon does the Secretary think he might visit India.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “This could be in spring, possibly March or April.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “Can we take this as definite? The Indian Government will warmly welcome the Secretary. India admires what the Secretary has achieved and what he would achieve, especially in his effort to bring about peace in the Middle East.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I hope you will come visit me in the institution to which I'll be confined when the Middle East negotiations were completed.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “I am glad to be relieved of the responsibility of representing Egypt.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I wonder whether this is so; even though the Egyptians now have an Ambassador in Washington, we have not yet formally re-established diplomatic relations. Doesn't that mean you are still responsible?”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “At some stage it would be helpful if the Secretary or the President could make a statement on Indo-US relations.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “This would be easy. Perhaps the Department Spokesman could say something in the context of the rupee settlement, or should it come directly from the Secretary?”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “It would be better from the Secretary.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “We will arrange for a question during the next press conference after the trip to Europe and the Middle East.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “The Secretary said he would alert me if you think it would be useful for me to talk with Congressmen regarding the proposed rupee settlement.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “This will not be necessary. We are hoping to move the settlement through without calling much attention to it. We hope to transmit it quickly to Congress before Christmas. It has to be there for only 30 days and during much of this time Congress will be in recess. We are in good shape.”</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d152-05" facs="d152-05"/>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “US naval presence in the Indian Ocean has prompted some questions in the Indian Parliament, especially since Secretary Schlesinger's recent announcement. The US has perhaps noticed that the idea of an Indian Ocean conference was suggested in the recent Indo-Soviet communique and also mentioned in the context of the Indian Ocean Peace Zone deliberations at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. What is the US reaction to the idea of such a conference which might lay down rules for peaceful commerce and find ways to avoid tension?”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “We would have no problem with that kind of thing. We would have problems, however, with a conference or actions directed against access to base facilities. As I said before, if we could only rename the Indian Ocean, you wouldn't care about our ships. They are not directed at India. I need a chance to study the idea of a conference. I have not looked into it. Regarding US naval forces, we are not planning to replace the carrier Oriskany.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “The New York Times also speaks of possible naval bases for the Soviets. We have categorically declared that India is not giving naval bases to the Soviet Union. I do not know where the Times gets the idea for its story.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “The New York Times predicted that Indo-US relations would be irreparably damaged in 1971. I never thought this would be the case. Now the Times is annoyed at the Indians because relations are improving.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “Returning to the question of your visiting India, can we consider March or April as firm? I want to emphasize that we are not going to be fussy and have no complex about your stopping off en route to or from some other place.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I will come if anything takes me into the area. Even if not, I will try. I much appreciate the invitation; let us leave it that I will try to make it in the first six months of 1974.”</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d152-06" facs="d152-06"/>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “There is one final subject I want to bring up: the place of India in the State Department organization. Lumping India together with the Middle East Bureau does not do justice to South Asia, and I want to leave the idea with the Secretary of a separate bureau for South Asia.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “If we make a separate South Asia bureau, this will require legislation to create a new assistant secretary. Are there other possibilities?”</p>

                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “However, Pakistan should remain part of the Asia bureau and not be left with the Middle East.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I agree that this is organizationally necessary, but wonder whether it is also politically true. Is it bad to think of tying Pakistan in with the Middle East?”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “This would not work. Pakistan's roots are in South Asia, not the Middle East. Politically, economically, strategically, Pakistan is part of South Asia.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “I have often played with the idea of placing Greece and Turkey in with Europe and shifting South Asia to the Asia Bureau.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>: “I would think it better for South Asia to be in the East Asia Bureau than with <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>. The Subcontinent has more in common with Southeast Asia than with the Middle East.”</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: “In any case, I cannot take the Subcontinent away from <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> as long as JOE SISCO is Assistant Secretary.”</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> “Before leaving, I wanted to say how impressed I was by the swearing-in ceremonies for Vice President Ford yesterday.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>On December 13, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> and the appropriate Indian authorities initialed ad referendum in New Delhi the proposed text of an Indo-US agreement which would resolve the matter of our large holdings of Indian rupees.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum seeks your final approval of the terms of the agreement; your approval of their transmittal to certain Congressional committees, as required by law; and your approval ofmessages from you to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> and to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> marking this important positive step in our relations with India.</p>
                        <p>The agreement must lie for review before the House and Senate Agriculture and Foreign Affairs/Foreign Relations Committees for at least 30 days before it can be signed and enter into force. We hope to transmit the agreement to these committees before the Congressional recess begins on or about December 20. This would demonstrate to the Indians that we share their strong interest in bringing this matter to a prompt conclusion. Additionally, prompt transmittal would mean that Congress would have the agreement in hand only shortly after the contents are reported in the press. The actual transmittal would be effected by the Departments of State and Agriculture after you have given your approval.</p>
                        <p>The proposed settlement more than meets our negotiating instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>, which you approved last July. It provides that we would retain about $1.1 billion worth of rupees; the instructions to <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> called for at least $1 billion. We would be turning back <pb n="2" xml:id="d154-02" facs="d154-02"/>the rest of our rupee holdings—about $2.2 billion worth—to the Government of India to help finance mutually agreed-upon economic development projects and programs there.</p>
                        <p>The advantages to the US in reaching this agreement are as follows:
<list>
                                <item>—Diplomatic benefit: The agreement will remove a long-standing irritant from US-Indian relations and contribute to the continuing improvement in our relations. Our rupee balances already amount to a sizable potential US claim on real Indian resources. Without an agreement we would continue to accumulate rupees, far in excess of what we might ever be able to spend, until India had finally finished repaying its rupee debts to us in the year 2012.</item>
                                <item>—Economic benefit: The agreement insures that we will have the use of enough rupees to cover our expenses in India for a substantial period of time—about 20 years if recent rates of expenditure are maintained. In the absence of an agreement India would probably place tight restrictions on our ability to use our rupees.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Department of State has carefully reviewed the legal aspects of this matter and has concluded that the Executive Branch has the legal authority to complete this settlement as proposed. We have also been consulting closely on this issue with the relevant House and Senate Committee members since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> began negotiations with the Indians last summer. Most of the Congressmen and Senators consulted did not indicate objections to the proposed settlement. The Agriculture Committee Chairmen, Senator Talmadge and Representative Poage, were somewhat cool to the proposal, and Senator Harry Byrd has made three attempts to gain enactment of amendments that would require prior approval of a rupee settlement by the full Congress. The Byrd amendments, although initially supported on the Senate floor, were deleted by the relevant House-Senate Conferences. On balance, the agreement appears to have a very good chance of obtaining the necessary concurrence of the committees. It has been made clear to the Indians, however, that Congressional reaction might make it necessary for us to seek further modifications in the agreement before signature and entry into force.</p>

                        <p>Because the initialing of this agreement marks an important milestone in our improving relations with India, we believe that letters from you to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> would be appropriate. At Tab A are suggested letters for your signature. A state Department memo and a fuller outline of the terms of the proposed agreement are at Tabs B and C for your information.</p>

                            <item>Have made an effort in the past week or so to try to understand, in a military way at least, just what the Paks are talking about on the question of additional military equipment from the United States. With such info as we have here from Defense Attache and Defense Rep have attempted to get educated on what Paks now have, on how this compares in numbers and in sophistication with whatIndia and Afghanistan have, and lastly, on what the Paks really want. Our information may not be <pb n="2" xml:id="d155-02" facs="d155-02"/>completely up to date but probably quite good enough for the purpose of this review. There follows herein certain conclusions and observations from this study. It will contain no surprises for planners in the Pentagon, and certainly will not be as complete as they could produce. Am sending these thoughts along partially because I am not certain how recently our people in Washington and in adjacent countries have taken a look at the practical side of the problem. Obviously this is an in-house study and we have not talked to the Paks about it.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The phrase “additional military equipment” can in itself be misleading. As far as numbers are concerned,Pakistan would seem to have all the hardware they need, particularly considering their urgent economic and developmental needs. There are some exceptions to this general conclusion, which will be mentioned later on in this message.</item>

                            <item>The problem is rather, and again partially with these same exceptions, a question of the level of sophistication of weapons and other military equipment.</item>

                                    <item>Tanks: At first glance at figures of stocks on hand the Paks would seem to be in a surprisingly good position vis-à-vis their neighbors. Upon closer look, however, it is easy to understand the concern of the Pak military on this score. About half of their medium tanks are Chinese, which are quite inferior to the Soviet T-55's ofIndia and Afghanistan (not to mention the T-62). The Chinese T-59 is manual shift, has no vertical stabilizer system, and must be stopped to be fired. Pakistan is also concerned by the high density of more modern night-sighting devices on their neighbors armor. An additional factor, not reflected by the overall numbers is the 345 Pak tanks with a 75/76 mm main gun. These can in no way compare with the 100 and 105 mm guns on Indian and Afghan tanks. The Pakistan Army wants to upgrade the M47/48 tanks by <pb n="4" xml:id="d155-04" facs="d155-04"/>retro-fitting them with diesel, upgunning to the 105 mm tube, and adding IR capability. (In my first substantive talk with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, he asked me to see if we could be helpful in modernizing our tanks here, saying that he understood we were doing this in Iran. I did not report this at the time as I wanted first to find out the history of the problem here, and also to make this overall study. Will report as fully as we can from here on the magnitude and other aspects of such-a requested effort on our part as soon as I can.)</item>

                                    <item>Artillery: Again the numbers are not a good measure of the comparative quality and future capability. Pak artillery is mostly from PRC. The guns are gladly accepted by the Paks because there they have no other source but the guns are generally considered inferior to the Soviet or U.S. counterpart. An additional deficiency is the inferior fusing and limited variety of ammunition provided by the Chinese. Indian ability to manufacture artillery has a psychological and material effect on the Pak/Indian balance. Pakistan is especially concerned because even re-tubing an old gun depends upon foreign military assistance. As an example of this concern, I am told that some of the present tubes are so worn that the Paks feel they can no longer afford to use them for target practice which would wear <pb n="5" xml:id="d155-05" facs="d155-05"/>them further.</item>
                                    <label>c.</label>
                                    <item>Fighter Aircraft: Quantitatively the Indian Air Force appears to have a two-to-one ratio over Pakistan Air Force and the Paks in turn maintain approximately that same ratio over the Afghan Air Force. The latest information we have on the Indian MIG-21 is that India has an inventory of 200. I wonder if that isn't somewhat deflated in view of the Indian production capability. Quality-wise I suspect that the Indian Air Force is well ahead of the Pak Air Force due to their MIG-21 and 2000 plus pilots Estimates on the F-6 (MIG-19) inventory in the PAF. range from 120 to 145 with probably 45 maintained in a flyable storage. There is no doubt that the Mirage III and V are first line aircraft but with only 42 to 44 in the PAF inventory they are not a major factor. The estimate on the PAF F-86/Sabre inventory varies up to 135, although it is unlikely that over 75 are currently maintained in flyable condition. The capability of this 20 plus year old aircraft cannot be counted on to any great extent. On the Afghan Air Force side I don't see much of <pb n="6" xml:id="d155-06" facs="d155-06"/>a match and one must question their pilot capability after reviewing the message traffic on the Air Force problems over the past six months.</item>
                                    <label>d.</label>
                                    <item>Bombers: The bomber forces of the three countries are not formidable factors, but again it is India over Pakistan by about two-to-one ratio. Only question arises here is PRC intentions regarding Pak employment of the TU-16 (Badger). Understand that PAF flight and maintenance crews have trained in PRC over last 18 months.</item>

                                    <item>Air Transport: Herein lies the first major exception to the rule that the Paks seem to have sufficient equipment in a numerical sense, but that it is either obsolete or inferior. The Paks really don't have any, at least not beyond some logistical lift in emergency, but certainly not sufficient to give them any ability in air deployment of troops. This is a really decided disadvantage in view of the India capability with over 200 transport aircraft and in excess of 100 transport helicopters. On occasion the Paks will have six C-130's in-commission and 4 to 5 of their 9 MI-8 transport helicopters operational. <pb n="7" xml:id="d155-07" facs="d155-07"/>Even the Afghans can out-transport the Paks.</item>

                                    <item>Air Defense: Herewith is the second exception to the rule. Pakistan has no surface-to—air missiles at all, in contrast to bothIndia and Afghanistan. This disadvantage is psychologically hard to take in addition to its practical aspects.</item>
                                    <label>g.</label>
                                    <item>Navy: The Indian navy has a decided naval advantage which also includes exceptions to the rule. Of major surface units the Indians have an operational aircraft carrier with a naval air arm, eight Soviet built OSA-class large guided missile patrol boats (PTFG) and five landing ships (LST/LSM); the Paks have none. In destroyers/escorts/frigates;India has 29, Pakistan has 5. Of the Indian total, six are modern Leander-class frigates built in Bombay while Paks have inferior, obsolete British built units. The Paks are virtually defenseless against the Indian OSA-class boat with its SS-N-2 STYX missiles. The capability of these boats was amply demonstrated during the 1971 war when Pak ships and oil storage area at Karachi harbor were severely hit. The Pak Navy wants modern weapons (missiles and guns) and electronics <pb n="8" xml:id="d155-08" facs="d155-08"/>systems to equip ships and aircraft so as to provide. protection for their only strategic harbor, Karachi, where the naval base, fuel facilities, and major industrial facilities are located; as well as to provide some protection for the near-by supply lines.</item>

                            <item>If I were Chief of Staff here, and charged with the necessity for a creditable defense capability, I would (a) try to get the U.S. (as we are the only ones who could do it) to retrofit our M-47 and M-48 tanks and retube to 105 MM since they would be no match at all now with the tanks of neighbors. I might even try to retrofit and upgrade the old Shermans, in view of the expense of new tanks. I would then drop some of the Chinese tanks out of inventory, reduce personnel, and have a much better even though smaller fleet, (b) try to obtain modern fighters (perhaps a, lesser number) and phase the F-86's out, (c) want sufficient modern air transport to give some mobility of forces, (d) want at least a modest modern air defense of our only port at Karachi, with its vital logistical complex impunity, and (e) want some of the things mentioned in 4, g for the Navy, knowing that I <pb n="9" xml:id="d155-09" facs="d155-09"/>could never get enough to match the Indians, but enough to force caution on the part of hostile craft in coming close enough to allow our largest city and only port to be within the range of their weapons.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>If I were Prime Minister here, I would of course want the very same things for a creditable defense posture, to the extent my country could afford it, and to the extent I can get foreign help, hopefully from the United States because our military likes U.S. hardware better, and as that would show U.S. support and backing. I would know that trying to reach parity with India would be folly in view of the disparity in size and strength of the two countries. I would, therefore, be primarily interested in developing defensive forces of sufficient sophistication to be a factor to be reasoned with, as I tried to accomplish the Simla objectives and then try to move beyond that in other steps to improve relations with India, and hopefully with Afghanistan. (I would, of course, be watchful as regards Indian intentions, and the extent of Soviet support there, continually weighing what might be the state of affairs in India in some years <pb n="10" xml:id="d155-10" facs="d155-10"/>to come, perhaps after Indira. And always with an eye on Afghanistan, and Soviet moves there. If it should become apparent that the Soviets intend to put massive equipment behind Baud, something would just have to give.) I would, however, be willing to keep military expenditures down close to a risky minimum in the process of watching our neighbors and trying to improve relations with them, in order to devote all possible attention to national development and to the betterment of the livelihood of my people, both for the good that that would do, and the fact that this would seem to be the surest way for me to remain in power in a parliamentary democracy. But then, as Prime Minister, I would also have to weigh how much I need the support of the military to hold political power. I would have to keep the stated needs of the military well in mind for if I let their strength go below levels they thought really necessary, I just might not be around anymore as Prime Minister to make all these decisions. On the other hand, by keeping them reasonably confident that in my civil rule I am taking those steps that I reasonably can in the interest of the basic security of our country, we would together <pb n="11" xml:id="d155-11" facs="d155-11"/>hopefully, gradually build up a lasting tradition of the military being subservient to civil authority.</item>

                            <item>But, I am of course neither of these gentlemen, but just a new Ambassador trying to take a good look at where things stand as of now. An interesting sidelight developed out of this study. There seemed to be a general consensus that, within some finite and not very long period, we are going to be out of business as far as our past relations with the Pak military are concerned. Our equipment, even now obsolete, will further deteriorate to the point where we will not be very important here on the security side. The Attaches already see this trend and that leaves me rather sad, not only because of an awareness of past relationships, but also because of the basic importance of the military in this country. In judging this we must bear in mind that we have (with the one exception of the 300 APC's) not been able, as a matter of policy, to either add to or up-grade any major categories of weapons here for a period of something over eight years.</item>

                        <p>SUMMARY: The Embassy has seen no evidence during the past year of change in Indian policy on nuclear weapons issues. Government spokesmen have repeated standard policy statements with no <pb n="2" xml:id="d156-02" facs="d156-02"/>significant new variations: India will utilize atomic energy only for peaceful purposes; it is investigating the possibilities of “peaceful” nuclear explosions; it does not plan to develop nuclear weapons. We have seen no evidence to confirm an Indian decision to explode a nuclear device or to manufacture nuclear weapons or delivery systems. We have detected no serious new efforts in areas relevant to nuclear weapons capabilities. Gradual expansion of India's nuclear and rudimentary space programs has continued. But both have been slowed by resource pinch and have failed to keep up with plan targets. We are inclined to believe—and this is only speculation—that Indian preoccupation with economic malaise tends to militate against an early decision to exercise nuclear options. END SUMMARY.</p>

                            <item>As in the past, Government policy on nuclear weapons issues has been expounded primarily in response to parliamentary critics. The defense of the current policies has emphasized the expense of a nuclear deterrent, the adequacy of conventional forces, the problems of “peaceful” nuclear explosions, and that India is keeping abreast <pb n="3" xml:id="d156-03" facs="d156-03"/>of developments in this field. Characteristically, Parliament in 1973 was told:
<list>
                                    <item>—Government policy is to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes only. We do not plan to develop nuclear weapons. (Defense Minister Ram in August)</item>
                                    <item>—National security is not jeopardized by present policy. India should not embark on a policy of nuclear armament because of the long term cost and increasing expenditures to develop and maintain a delivery system. (Minister of State for Defense Production Shukla in August)</item>
                                    <item>—We are reviewing the technology, economic value, and environmental and ecological effects of underground nuclear explosions. Only after satisfactory answers to all these problems are available can peaceful underground tests be undertaken. (Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> in November)</item>

                            <item>We have noted no change in India's <pb n="4" xml:id="d156-04" facs="d156-04"/>negative attitude toward the Nonproliferation Treaty (New Delhi 13654), its support for the Limited Test Ban Treaty, and its public opposition to nuclear weapon tests.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>As to capabilities, the direction and gradual expansion of India's relatively sophisticated nuclear program has been maintained. But schedules for atomic energy projects have been delayed, and slippage in plans has been publicly acknowledged by the Government. Interest in rocketry and space exploration and collaborative programs with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and western countries has continued. An Indian satellite may be launched by the Soviets in 1975. Projected fifth plan outlays call for devoting three-fourths of the space research and development budget to rocketry. Recently, however, the rudimentary Indian program has been plagued by delays, strikes, and resource problems. In general, there appears to be a growing appreciation of the high costs and time required to move ahead in these areas and a recognition that earlier visionary plans cannot be fulfilled.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>As to intentions, there were virtually no rumors in 1973 as there were in earlier years of an imminent Indian nuclear explosion—and little discussion of such possibility among observers here. This, of course is no guide to Indian Government plans. We know little about relevant internal government debate on nuclear weapons and <pb n="5" xml:id="d156-05" facs="d156-05"/>test policies—or even if the issue is currently. We believe, however, that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> remains firmly in control of decisions in this area. And we have no reason to revise earlier estimates that she finds an open-options approach politically useful but opposes—emotionally and on economic grounds—exercising the nuclear option.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Background factors that strike us as relevant are:
<list>
                                    <item>—Since the Bangladesh war public interest in military issues appears to have receded; a truncated Pakistan no longer seems a major threat; Chinese hostility has somewhat diminished; good relations and military cooperation with the Soviets have been maintained; cooperation with countries that would oppose an Indian test is desired; India has largely achieved its central objective of a dominant position in South Asia without the bomb.</item>
                                    <item>—Preoccupation with economic problems, food shortages, labor unrest, energy costs, and oil supplies has increased dramatically.</item>
                                    <item>—In this atmosphere advocates of the nuclear option in press <pb n="6" xml:id="d156-06" facs="d156-06"/>and Parliament have not been able to command great attention and public pressure on the Government to “go nuclear” has certainly not increased.</item>
                                </list>
                            </item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>A year and a half ago we speculated in reftel that a severe and political deterioration in India might tempt the leadership towards the psychological boost of a nuclear explosion. We would like to modify that judgment in light of our experience since that time. India's deepening economic problems are being expressed for the government in acute budget stringencies, for public and private industry in the difficulties of maintaining production and services in the face of shortages and strikes, and for the middle and lower classes in finding the jobs and money to pay for the bare necessities of life. Politics is focusing increasingly on these issues rather than on grander nationalistic aspirations where confidence has in any event declined since 1972. In this context, we believe the potential popular appeal of a nuclear test is less, that there would be less support among the leadership for such a course of action, and that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> herself would be more <pb n="7" xml:id="d156-07" facs="d156-07"/>inclined to oppose it.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>A Chinese missile launch in the Indian Ocean area might (as mentioned in reftel) influence Indian thinking on its nuclear options. But current government doctrine is that China's programs need not alter India's reliance on conventional forces. Asked in Parliament in November about press reports that most of Asia is within China's missile range, Defense Minister Ram states that “the defense of our border can best be ensured by adequate military preparedness based upon conventional weapons.” The Defense Production Minister told Parliament in August that “we do not accept the theory that China can blackmail us by developing nuclear capability.”</item>
                            <label>8</label>
                            <item>In sum, India retains its capability to explode a nuclear device on short notice and to carry on a limited weapons program. Its aircraft capability will be the only delivery system available for the foreseeable future. More realistic expectations for India's nuclear and missile prospects have not increased the potential military advantages of early exercise of nuclear options. India's present international and <pb n="8" xml:id="d156-08" facs="d156-08"/>economic position appear to us to tip the likelihood of an early test to a lower level than in recent years.</item>

The decision marks an important new step in the process of normalization and improvement of relations among the countries of South Asia which began in mid-1972 with the Simla agreement between India and Pakistan. We do not know yet whether Pakistan's recognition was accompanied by new concessions from Bangladesh on their longstanding dispute over possible war crimes trials of Pakistani POWs. However, Pakistan's act of recognition should remove whatever remaining possibility there may have been that Bangladesh would go forward with such trials.</p>
                        <p>I believe that identical congratulatory messages from you to Prime Ministers <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and Mujib would be appropriate, and I suggest that we send them the following message by telegram through our embassies in Islamabad and Dacca:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have learned with profound pleasure of the announcement of recognition of the Government of Bangladesh by the Government of Pakistan.

                        </list>
                        <p>SUMMARY: This country is in trouble. The crude oil crisis hit on top of a grain pinch, a sluggish economy, and rising domestic pressures and political pressures. We foresee an India less confident, less potentially influential, and more frustrated in the conduct of its foreign affairs than might have been expected, say, after the Bangladesh war and in terms of the rhetoric of earlier years. A key problem as India focuses on the competition for <pb n="2" xml:id="d158-02" facs="d158-02"/>bare essentials is its increasing isolation and lack of leverage in the emerging framework of world affairs. The new military potential of Persian Gulf countries is seen as a special threat. West Asia will be a major preoccupation of Indian policy; East and Southeast Asia will not. In South Asia, to which India's ability to project military power will be limited, India will be a cautious supporter of the status quo, interested in the stability and integrity of its neighbors. It will remain concerned over Chinese influence and anxious to retain Soviet support. END SUMMARY.</p>

                            <item>India's economic difficulties are going to bear increasingly on the style and focus of its foreign policy. It seems to us that to some degree the military and diplomatic success of the India's Bangladesh war obscured the underlying problems and limitations. The war coincided with a period of domestic political consolidation, industrial progress, and agricultural sufficiency—the peak of the green revolution. The successes of 1971 raised expectations both here and abroad that India would be a stronger regional power and a more influential voice in world affairs.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>India's confidence has been shaken and its visions trimmed by renewed awareness of scarcity and economic debility. The pinch started at home with drought in 1972 and industrial stagnation. Then a changed international market hit India first with expensive grain and next with an oil crisis. Here, as <pb n="3" xml:id="d158-03" facs="d158-03"/>elsewhere, the ultimate implications of the energy crisis are not yet apparent. However, the preoccupation of policy is how to compete from a highly disadvantaged position for the bare essentials. As a function of economic weakness, rising domestic political pressures, and the momentum of earlier habits, Indian foreign policy will continue frequently to evidence posturing and attitudinizing rather than hard analytical judgments.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>India's economic problems in the new world market undercut its capacity to be a relatively more significant autonomous power center. Its ability to project military power beyond its immediate region is unlikely to grow—unless it goes nuclear, and we believe preoccupation with economic problems marginally reinforces the current disinclination to do so. In the short run, military priorities and allocations will remain intact and existing capabilities will not be undercut. But a government concerned with the fragility of domestic order and a precarious economy will be anxious to avoid any regional conflict.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>One of the major difficulties for India in dealing with its problems is its isolation in the current international arena. India is outside the stream of Western dialogue. It is not part of Soviet group or communist consultations. Isolated by geography and culture, it is beyond the fringe of Asian-Pacific associations and is excluded from Arab-Muslim activities. Outsized and <pb n="4" xml:id="d158-04" facs="d158-04"/>mistrusted, India finds within South Asia neither the solidarity nor the numbers that make other regions significant in international councils.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>India thus turns to larger, softer forums such as the Non-Aligned Conference and the “Group of 77”. But among the non-aligned, India's voice has been increasingly incidental to the direction imparted by the Afro-Arab activists. While India might have a potential new role as spokesman for the oil-importing non-aligned, it has not yet exercised such leadership and appears reluctant to become a leader—and a target. Except for a few old friends like Tito, heads of government no longer appear to look to India in the role it once set up for itself—a non-aligned leader with some authority and potential. The moral suasion is gone. Detente has eliminated opportunities for maneuver and mediation. High-level visitors still come to New Delhi, but their visits seem increasingly empty of content except for those from neighboring countries. In sum, beyond South Asia, governments give India little consideration in making their plans.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>India was fortunate to have consolidated its regional preeminence before the current economic crisis. A major foreign policy objective will be to preserve it. More than ever before, perhaps, India has reason to be a status quo power in the region. It will remain involved in ticklish housekeeping problems with all of its neighbors that can easily bruise sensibilities and arouse suspicions. With Pakistan, India will seek a gradual improvement <pb n="5" xml:id="d158-05" facs="d158-05"/>in relations—although neither Indian officials nor we are sanguine about the prospects for substantial cooperation. With Bangladesh, India hopes to remain the major political and economic partner but is uncertain it will. With regard to all its immediate neighbors, India will be interested in stability and integrity—and intensely concerned about their relations with China. We expect no major initiatives unless internal disruptions or Chinese influence pose an immediate threat to India. India does not expect the latter contingency to arise but is wary and sensitive to the potential. Some Indian policy-makers look toward a more consolidated and closer South Asian entente which would strengthen the economic and political voice of the entire region. The grouping would include all India's neighbors with India as the centerpiece. It is a goal which has considerable merit in every respect except the enormous unlikelihood that the other South Asian countries would be interested.</item>

                            <item>India may be the country most afraid of the new military potential of Persian Gulf countries. In this respect, the implications of the new cost of crude is a double jolt. India sees the weapons piling up around the Gulf as inherently destabilizing and a direct threat through transfer to Pakistan—in time of war, if not before. The Gulf sheikhdoms deny this, and India's reluctance to antagonize the Arabs makes it loath to challenge such assurances even though it does not believe them. India sees a new and competitive concentration of power in the <pb n="6" xml:id="d158-06" facs="d158-06"/>Persian Gulf region—one where it competes at a disadvantage with Pakistan for influence and one that is bound to take priority over India in the calculations of the industrialized and major powers.</item>

                            <item>There is a sense of frustration that support for the Arab cause has never brought just reward—and that there is no alternative to continuing this policy or things might be even worse. India watched warily as Pakistan assembled the Arabs on India's doorstep at Lahore. It knows it can't pressure the Arabs through the non-aligned.India depends on West Asia for 70 percent of its oil and, despite its courting, there has been little interest in any special price deals for India, although opportunities for wider economic associations are developing. West Asia will be a major preoccupation of Indian policy. It will continue to cast about for economic cooperation and easy terms with Gulf countries and express concern to the West—but not to the Arabs—that it not sell them so many guns.</item>

                            <item>Toward Southeast Asia and the Pacific, Indian efforts will be modest. Its influence will be limited by dislike or disinterest on the part of many of the states in the region and on the absence on India's part of energetic policy. India hopes not to be shut out of the area by tight subregional groupings. It would like to see larger forums like ECAFE that include India strengthened. It will continue its cautious policy toward Indo-China aiming to wind up on the right side <pb n="7" xml:id="d158-07" facs="d158-07"/>of the winners. It will be concerned about any greatly increased Chinese influence— but it will be in no position to displace or affect the degree of such influence.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>India's relations with the great powers will continue to be determined in large measure by their attitude toward Indian preeminence in South Asia—a preeminence seen here as supported by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, accepted by the US, and still challenged by China. The principal competitors for external influence in South Asia are the Soviet Union and China. Both seek to influence India's posture toward the other—the Soviets by their embrace, and the Chinese by their current aloofness. India would like to achieve greater balance and leverage by normalizing relations with China while holding the advantages of the Soviet tie. The prospect of a Chinese mission in Dacca has made India even more anxious to improve relations with Peking. But a sense of weakness and almost psychological need for the support of an outside power will make India extremely wary of undermining Soviet support in order to please China.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>In sum, as we see it, the drift and deterioration in India's domestic politics, the dramatic changes in oil and grain markets, and the evolving structure of world affairs severely limit Indian potential and leverage. This country is in trouble, traveling a downward curve with no current prospect of an upturn and no predictable decomposition. Reflections in foreign policy will be:

                        <p>At the beginning of the meeting, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> introduced Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to Foreign Minister <persName>Singh</persName>, and the Foreign Minister offered his best wishes. He said that he was looking forward to the visit of the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s to India, and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated her enthusiasm for the trip. The Indians noted that the time of year they had chosen was not the best. The Foreign Minister said early June is “a little hot.” There followed a discussion of just how warm it would be, and the Secretary recalled his own visit to New Delhi in January when it had been quite cold. The Foreign Minister said India is a large country and there are some places that can be quite pleasant, such as Kashmir. The Secretary jokingly said that he would “infuriate three countries” if he went to Kashmir but he said he would like to see it some day and noted that he had never been there. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> asked the Secretary how long he thought he might stay, and the Secretary felt that three days was about the maximum. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> suggested that one day might be spent at Agra and two in New Delhi. At this point, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> left, and the following conversation took place.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Foreign Minister, your Ambassador in Washington is very effective. He uses terror tactics on me. He continually puts me under moral pressure.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d160-02" facs="d160-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Singh</persName>: We feel that relations betweenIndia and the US are on their way to improvement. This is happening slowly, but both sides are doing everything possible. There has been a turn for the better. If I may say so, the general situation in our part of the world has contributed in great measure to this improvement. A war took place which should never have taken place. But now we are trying to stabilize the peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: The outcome of the recent negotiations in New Delhi was quite pleasing to us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: They were not easy. They paved the way for complete normalization of relations. The Pakistani recognition of Bangladesh did make the meeting possible. This had taken place much later than we had hoped, but we were glad it came. President <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is fond of choosing a moment for a dramatic step. Sometimes he gets himself into a situation where he looses control over his choice of timing. But that is a style that we are getting used to.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Maybe he had his domestic reasons for choosing the timing that he did.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: That is one of the reasons the Pakistanis give, but I am not sure. I recall that at Simla he said that he should have recognized Bangladesh early in 1972. He sometimes creates a near crisis then tries to recover the situation. That is just his style.</p>
                        <p>It was an act of generosity on the part of Bangladesh to release the last Pakistani prisoners of war. Atrocities such as the people of Bangladesh suffered are not easy to forget.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I didn't think in 1971 that Bangladesh would soon be able to muster the wisdom it has since shown.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: The repatriation will be completed soon. Practically all of the Bengalees have come out of Pakistan. There were 120,000 less than expected. Maybe there are 2-3,000 who will turn up, but essentially that operation is completed.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d160-03" facs="d160-03"/>
                        <p>The question of the Pakistanis in Bangladesh is more ticklish. This is a large group which collaborated with the Pakistani military in 1971. The Pakistanis, however, are not responsive to their desire to live in Pakistan. Bangladesh did not make a major issue of this in New Delhi. It was agreed that there would be a process of review and joint consultation on additional members of this group who might want to leave. The Prime Ministers of Bangladesh and Pakistan will meet to decide on how many more of these people should leave. It is not of major importance, but it is unfortunate that the Pakistanis have resisted so much taking more of these people because their resistance creates suspicions inBangladesh that Pakistan is leaving this group in Bangladesh as a potential fifth column. Let's hope the Pakistanis will not use these people for future subversive action.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I can't imagine that this would serve Pakistan's interests. They were not able to control the situation when they were in charge. I cannot believe that they would consider trying to manipulate it from outside.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese have told us that they are now planning to recognize Bangladesh and that they plan to be quite active there. I assume that their activity will probably not be all that constructive from the Indian point of view.</p>
                        <p>Whatever our views in 1971 were, now that Bangladesh is independent we want into be stable. In any case, our position in 1971 had nothing to do withIndia or Bangladesh. It was affected by our opening to China and our relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: We also have information that the Chinese are keen to come to Bangladesh soon. We assume that they will use the internal situation for their own advantage.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I have the same impression. They talk in terms of the closeness of the Bangladesh and the Chinese people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: They have some people who will be quite active there. They will use their presence there to generate anti-Indian acts. But we will have to live with that problem. We are neighbors of China, and there is nothing we can do with the fact that they are there and will be active in their own neighborhood. In any case, American and Indian interests and objectives are the same.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes. They are parallel. We want a stable, progressive and democratic Bangladesh. There is no need for us to fight again the problems of two years ago. They had nothing to do with Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: You are aware that the Naxalites' headquarters are not very far from Bangladesh. There is contact between them and extremist elements in Bangladesh. I am sorry to say that there have been some political killings in Bangladesh which are traceable to them.</p>
                        <p>The problems of Bangladesh are immense. They have no reserves, and they have been given no share of the assets that belonged to united Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Should I stop in Bangladesh when I am in South Asia? I have an invitation to go there. [To <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>] I suspect that you put the Bangladesh Ambassador up to this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: No, I didn't.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: That is for you to decide.</p>
                        <p>We have a correct relationship with Bangladesh. India had 300,000 soldiers in Bangladesh when the ceasefire took place. By March 15, 1972, all Indian soldiers had been withdrawn. Bangladesh was pleading with us to leave them there. We said that we did not want an Indian army involved in maintaining law and order in Bangladesh. We told them that we didn't want influence there. Even in these recent talks in New Delhi, we played a friendly, sober, cooperative, mature role. The talks went best when the three Foreign Ministers were alone. We did not try to influence the Bangladesh Foreign Minister at all.</p>
                        <p>We know what will happen when the Chinese and the Pakistanis are in Bangladesh. They will exploit forces unfriendly to the government. But, as I said, China is nearby, and we have to learn to live with its presence.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Benhima</hi>: I would like to see what is behind it.</p>

                            </hi>: They want $1 billion which our Congress voted and which we have been holding up. That is what is behind it. On the question of disengagement between Israel and Syria we know two things:</p>
                        <p>—Israel must move back behind the October 6 line. They have not even agreed to go back as far as the October 6 line yet.</p>
                        <p>—Then the question is whether President Asad can be persuaded to get less than he would like.</p>
                        <p>At present, he is proposing that three-fifths of the Israeli-occupied territory be returned to Syria. This is unattainable. The major objective, as we see it is to get a first step—to get some withdrawal. We hope that, if some withdrawal could be achieved, this would create a new situation. It is not surprising to me that the Israeli position has evolved the way it has. In October, Golda Meir literally turned her back on me at a dinner in Washington because I had proposed the idea of separation of Egyptian and Israeli forces and an Israeli pullback.</p>
                        <p>I hope the Syrians will be reasonable. But I will not even discuss the final line with them until I have an Israeli line which I feel begins to meet Syrian interests. I might at some point ask His Majesty to send an emissary to President Asad. On the whole, I am relatively optimistic.</p>

                            </hi>: We have taken soundings in Europe on the question of debt rescheduling, and the responses are generally not negative.</p>
                        <p>Also, we have made an effort with some of the oil suppliers—Iran and Iraq so far—to lighten the burden of the increased oil costs.</p>

                            </hi>: It is a form of relief for the time being. Broadly, of the total price, we put down about the amount equivalent to the price a year ago. The remainder reflecting recent increases is deferred until after five years.</p>

                            </hi>: You struck the right chord in your speech. The green revolution has taken root in India, and the farmers are getting used to the new techniques. Now if a farmer does not get the things he needs to use the new methods, he is thrown off. Fertilizer is one of the things necessary to make the new seeds work. We have made significant progress in production. We are almost self-sufficient. The problem is that we still have a shortage of about 2-3%. Because this is at the margin, it creates distress out of proportion to the relative quantity and it pushes up prices.</p>

                            </hi>: Ten years ago we used to think that it was inconceivable that India could ever feed itself. You have made remarkable progress.</p>

                            </hi>: You raised the possibility of food exports under PL 480. Last fall I went to Secretary BUTZ and he told me to hold off buying because he thought wheat prices would go down. Then the prices went up.</p>

                            </hi>: It is possible to investigate providing CCC credit. The problem is not the principle of credit but the availability. It has been extraordinary. Ten years ago, our objective was to get rid of surpluses. When the Russian wheat deal came up nobody ever dreamed that we could wipe out our surpluses. In fact, we were proud of selling so much grain.</p>

                            </hi>: One of the advantages of our improved relations is that we will move consideration of Indian issues out of routine bureaucratic handling.</p>

                            </hi>: I think we have a good chance of getting it through the Senate. I have talked with Congressman Wayne Hays. He said that he would withdraw his opposition if it passes the Senate.</p>

                            </hi>: The economic argument is that there are so many people in India who live on the margin of the economy, or even below the margin. The problem is one of maldistribution. This means that the reality is actually worse than the statistics. Thus, when there are shortages and problems of distribution, the people below the margin are hurt even more than the statistics show.</p>

The situation is not ripe yet. Perhaps it will be by May. Sometimes some of these arguments coming from people outside the administration carry more weight.</p>

                            </hi>: I don't want this necessarily to be part of the record. But I have explained how we have approached the Iranians and the Iraqis to help us meet the increased cost of oil imports. We would like to approach the Saudis next. But we thought perhaps you might mention this to them when you next see them. Our relations with the Arab countries have gradually been improving since our 1971 war with Pakistan. But it would be helpful if someone could help pave the way with the Saudis.</p>

It has been a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Foreign Minister. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> will be discussing aid questions in New Delhi, and we can talk about the commissions in Washington.

                            <item>The deeper we get into the many technical analyses on the Indian test, the more complicated it gets. Also we realize that Washington has more information on this than we do. Therefore we have decided to hold up on analytical reporting for the day and take another look tomorrow. In the meantime, here are some of our tentative conclusions.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The capability to assemble and explode a nuclear device was probably accomplished using plutonium production from the CIRUS 40 MW Indo-Canadian reactor in Trombay (Bhabha Atomic Research Center - BARC). “Plutonium capability being what it is, particularly in fabrication operations, and with something of the order of 150 kilos in a fabrication circuit, <pb n="2" xml:id="d163-02" facs="d163-02"/>enough material could be easily diverted from the core of la first device and covered up as being in scrap or processing losses.” This was the opinion of the Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board (CAECB) in 1972.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The US agreed to provide heavy water for the CIRUS reactor in 1956; India agreed that the heavy water would be used in connection with research into and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. In 1970 we reminded the Indians in an aide memoire that the United States would not consider the use of plutonium produced in CIRUS for peaceful nuclear explosives intended for any purpose to be “research into and use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.” Therefore, if our assumption about the source of India's nuclear materials is correct, we have a problem with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. The Indians, of course, do not agree with our interpretation of the agreement.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>We have also looked into the record of what the Indians have said about their nuclear policy to see how straightforward they have been. Indian officials have confined themselves to statements that studies are underway, without saying what actions India would take. In May of last year, for example, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> said that peaceful uses were being studied, “including the ecological and geological aspects of nuclear explosives.” We find no dissimulation here.</item>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: It is kind of you to receive me. I bring regards from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. We and the people of Pakistan are distressed about Watergate. It is very disturbing to us that it has been dragged out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Don't you worry about that; we will take care of that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: You know our situation, but let me bring you up to date. Our prisoners are back and we thought we could move to normalization with India. There still were a couple of problems. India's defense budget is the highest ever; the Soviet Union ships arms to India; BREZHNEV's visit has resulted in more arms — including SAM-6 and 7s. After <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName>'s visit to Moscow, 400 officers went to Moscow for training, and after he want to Afghanistan, 300 Afghans went to India.</p>
                        <p>These developments disturb us. They are building their army, but not to attack the PRC.</p>
                        <p>And we have no designs on Afghanistan. If the Soviets give them arms, it helps them with their irredentist aims. The Soviet Union tries to show they are not behind the Baluchistan movement.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d164-02" facs="d164-02"/>
                        <p>And while we were wondering why there is this Indian buildup, here comes the nuclear test. We were not surprised, but shocked. There is a tendency to play it down in some quarters, and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> says it's “peaceful.” We think the Soviet Union will enable them to build nuclear weapons. This detonation we think is just a first step in the development of nuclear weapons and a delivery system.</p>
                        <p>The timing of the explosion is interesting. The Prime Minister was in Peking a week ago. The PRC said they are ready now to establish relations with all states in the subcontinent. Why this timing? Is the Soviet Union or Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> trying to prevent better relations with the PRC?</p>
                        <p>Apart from the indirect pressure by the Soviet Union on us — and on Iran through Iraq — the idea is to get control of the Gulf, so we must be brought to heel.</p>
                        <p>Iran has moved to placate the Soviet Union. The Shah supported the South Asian security pact and said he would help implement it. On 14 March the Soviet Union sent this message to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> [He reads from note at Tab A]:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Pakistan's membership of CENTO and the activization of its participation in the military activities of the bloc is, in our opinion, an anachronism and it can scarcely meet the interests of the peace-loving countries of this region interested in making the process of relaxation of tension irreversible.” The message also refers to Asian Collective Security in Asia and asks Pakistan to consider supporting the idea and making a statement on the question.</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>So then the Soviet Union is getting more and more specific about the Asian Security System. We have no desire to be drawn in.</p>
                        <p>So here we are. Two things worry us. We are still weak. The provision of tanks is helpful and we are grateful we won't have to pay. But that doesn't add to our arsenal. We need defensive weapons — SAMs and anti-tank missiles. It is only for defense against India — and Afghanistan, which might not stand aside in another war.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister would like some help soon. And could the nuclear powers give a guarantee to the non-nuclear powers against nuclear attack? You gave one guarantee to India when China attacked, We think it would be helpful, not just for us but also for many others if more countries get nuclear weapons. A system which would rule out blackmail would reduce the incentive to get nuclear weapons. It is an immediate problem for us, but a general one for all.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d164-03" facs="d164-03"/>
                        <p>We are worried. We are holding out, trying to work for peace. You have been very kind and gracious.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: But not able to do very much. We must begin with an assessment — you should make one also — on the implications of the Indian nuclear weapons. We will keep you informed on our analysis.</p>
                        <p>If it is, as you describe, a Soviet attempt to encircle Pakistan and a move to another partition — as a part of a move to the Indian Ocean — we must assess that also.</p>
                        <p>Another point is what the U.S. can do. You know what restrictions have been put on us. We have done what we could on tanks and will continue. We will see on defensive capabilities what we can do directly or indirectly.</p>
                        <p>We will do what we can with India. We are starting a dialogue with them. Now, India in the past has not been easily dissuaded. But I think you know it is better for the U.S. to have some influence with India rather than leave it to the Soviet Union. The independence of Pakistan is a principle to which we are committed. We will use our influence to help you defend that independence, both by getting you the means and helping with other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Afghanistan thing is worrisome. An irresponsible Afghanistan could be the last cannon on the deck. You couldn't fight on two fronts. Of course, our position on the Asian Security system is the same as yours.</p>
                        <p>I would summarize thus: we will help as we can with military equipment, but we can't promise. Secondly, we will use our influence with India and the Soviet Union to restrain them. Third, your concept of a guarantee for the non-nuclear countries is one we must assess. We must hold this close — who knows who could be next?</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister is very sophisticated, both about his neighbors and about what we could do to affect the actions of those neighbors. We will make clear with the Soviet Union our determination about Pakistan. India needs our help and we will use our influence to focus India's energies internally and not externally.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the non-nuclear countries need some sort of guarantee. We may not be able to put it in a treaty.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: But the nuclear countries must know it.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d164-04" facs="d164-04"/>
                        <p>President: The PRC is your friend. They don't want an expanded India. We will keep in close touch with the Chinese on this. The PRC already has some nuclear capability. Your best hopes are the PRC and the United states — not in collusion but cooperating together, and by the U.S. playing a strong diplomatic role with the Soviet Union and India.</p>
                        <p>How we implement this we must work out. Trust what I told you at the time of the previous war. We did it with little support. But our actions then — and now — reflected our policy.</p>
                        <p>We are doing an assessment on these developments; you do likewise, and we will keep in close touch on what steps to take — publicly and privately — to ensure Pakistan's survival.</p>
                        <p>I am under no illusions about the Soviet Union — or India. Nor about Afghanistan, since they may be a Soviet puppet. But keep close lines to the PRC. They can't help much now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Ahmed</persName>: Thank you, Mr. President. Let me make just one or two brief comments. You should have influence with India, and with the Soviet Union. But India has gone to war when you had good relations with them. And the Soviet Union is unscrupulous. I don't know if they would stop in a crunch. And what do we tell our people? Not to worry? And for our armed forces: Everyone on both sides of us is rearming; only we can't get arms. We try to get something from France but it's only on tough financial terms. We are getting a few things, but the price has gone up 100% during our negotiations. Since we have no alternative, we have to pay the price. Our position is difficult.</p>
                        <p>President: I hate to have such a serious problem raised without being able to reassure you. I am seriously concerned, and we will take up at the highest level what we can do. We understand your assessment and we see what your neighbors are doing. I have no answers now, but we will try to develop answers at the highest level to the new situation. We don't want to promise what we can't deliver. Maybe your guarantee idea has merit. I promise we will look into it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Ahmed</persName>: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

                        <p>This Study presents a stark picture of India's future. Virtually all observers of the Indian scene would agree that the problems confronting the Indian government will become extremely serious over the next few years. Some would argue that the leaders in New Delhi can nonetheless find some way of muddling through. The argument here is simply that the chances of extensive trouble leading to crisis are quite high, and it is therefore only prudent to consider the international implications which could flow from a strife-torn Asian subcontinent.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Analyses of India, even by experts, are too often colored by the news of the moment. And the current news from that nation of nearly 600 million people is mostly bad. “This country is in trouble” cabled the US Ambassador from New Delhi in March 1974.<note n="1" xml:id="d165fn32" type="source">New Delhi 3236, 7 March 1974. Confidential.</note> In the same month, economists for the World Bank presented a report predicting huge and urgent Indian needs for economic and food aid over the next few years and warning of a “famine, of grave proportions” in the event of a monsoon failure.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn33" type="source">New York Times, 11 March 1974, page 10.</note> Well reported developments in India are in line with these assessments. Food is quite scarce despite a supposedly good harvest; prices are rising rapidly; the energy crisis threatens body blows to the economy; public unrest is spreading.</p>
                        <p>It is the thesis of this Research Study that India is likely to see comparable but more serious troubles over the longer term. The problems now facing the Indian government are harbingers of the future, although they may be ameliorated in the short run. In any event, the following is not primarily concerned with developments in India over the next several months or even the next few years. Its pessimistic prognoses are not rooted in recent gloomy news or in projections of hypothetical calamities.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3" type="source">For example, this study does not consider the hypothesis of some climatologists that changing weather patterns will mean that many areas of the world, India included, will soon suffer from droughts (and famines) unprecedented in the 20th century. That subject will be considered in a separate study now underway in the Office of Political Research.</note> This study attempts, after considering political, social, cultural, and economic determinants of change and stability, to assay likely trends in that large and complex country over the next decade or so.</p>
                        <p>After weighing the pros and cons it judges that:
<list>
                                <item>— The present Indian government, or any foreseeable successor, is unlikely to bring about dramatic economic <pb n="6" xml:id="d165-06" facs="d165-06"/>breakthroughs or social changes. But it will continue to achieve some modest gains and will—as it has in the past—show considerable staying power, even under adverse conditions.</item>
                                <item>— That government will probably not, over time, be able to cope with the food/population problem. With the number of people continuing to grow and the availability of food becoming more uncertain, a Malthusian crisis with widespread political repercussions will become increasingly likely— perhaps before the end of the 1970s.</item>
                                <item>— Were such a crisis to occur, it would increase the danger of an internal crippling of authority and even of fragmentation of the Indian union and the emergence of a power vacuum in the South Asian area.</item>
                                <item>— If these judgments are correct, important questions are raised about how such prospective difficulties could have their impact on the international community. Though no definitive answer can be confidently given, the various possibilities are canvassed in Section IV below. All could have implications, in some cases major ones, for US interests.</item>
                                <item>— Any attempt to create or play out specific scenarios is outside the scope of this study. But it is clear enough that aggravated Indian turmoil would generate a mix of temptation, suspicion, competition, and reaction among the principal powers. This is where India's “negative importance” to the world would surface—an importance which can be overlooked while that country, even though a member of the nuclear club, remains fairly stable and takes a passive (or largely ineffectual) role in international affairs. But in extremis, each of the great powers and the lesser ones abutting on India would be hypersensitive to what the other parties were doing or planning to do; each would be inclined to suspect the worst and would prepare to take countermeasures. The opportunities and incentives for one or another kind of interference in the matter would be very great; the chances of action and reaction leading to confrontation—or conflict—are large enough to merit serious US contingency study now.</item>

                        <p>“Objectivity” is a scarce commodity among students of India. That country tends to arouse strong emotions, pro or con, particularly when the subject is whether the Indians can and will be able to deal with their own problems. Thus:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Inertia, helplessness, lack of initiative and originality, lack of staying power and sustained loyalties, sterility of enthusiasm, weakness of life-vigor itself—all are traits that truly characterize the Indian not only of today, but of long-past history. All, furthermore, will continue to characterize him, in increasing degree….<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4" type="source">(4)Kathleen Mayo, Mother India, 1927, page 161.

                            <p>If the wellsprings of Indian development efforts seem to be drying up, the explanation must in large part be traced to the inability or unwillingness to reform the social and economic structure of the country.<note n="5" xml:id="d165fn5" type="source">(5) Gunnar Myrdal, Asian Drama, 1968, page 279.

                            <p>It is apparent, though, that even Western students of a conservative leaning, who cannot be suspected of any Communist sympathies, have begun to ask themselves whether a social revolution is not necessary in order to set the South Asian countries firmly on the road to progress.<note n="6" xml:id="d165fn6" type="source">Ibid., page 117.(6)</note>

                        <p>As opposed to such gloomy analysis are ones like the following:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Indians' sense of their rich cultural heritage, their record of professional achievement in the arts and sciences of the modern world, and their faith in their ability to govern themselves, combined to give them a national maturity that allowed a reasoned approach to the creation and working of government. Equipped with the basic qualifications, attitudes, and experience for creating and working a democratic constitution, Indians did not default their tryst with destiny.<note n="7" xml:id="d165fn7" type="source">Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution, Cornerstone of a Nation, 1966, page 330.</note>

                        <p>There is indeed no general agreement on what makes Indians do what they do. Psychological analyses of “national character” have not been particularly rewarding. All studies—including this one—of so complex a country as India are necessarily interpretive, and ample scope for disagreement continues to exist. But India was and is an open society. It has long been the object of research and analysis by Indians and non-Indians alike. From these studies a number of forces and trends can be derived.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Within India's enormous bulk there is a paradoxical mixture of strengths and weaknesses, of centrifugal and centripetal forces, of elements working for continuity and for change. Hinduism (85 percent of Indians are Hindus and the remainder are deeply affected by its traditions) is the strongest common bond. The belief that a “Hindu way of life” leads Indians to differ from others by inculcating spiritual, self-denying values as opposed to materialistic matters is both widespread and inaccurate.<note n="8" xml:id="d165fn8" type="source">“It is completely contrary to scientific principles to follow the easy, speculative approach of explaining the peculiarities in attitudes, institutions, arid modes of living and working by reference to broad concepts of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, or to personality or cultural traits such as abstention, spiritualism, lack of materialism, and other allegedly ‘Asian values.’ And it is not accidental that these broad generalizations can so easily be shown to be unrealistic.” Myrdal, op. cit., page 112.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>But there is an Indian social system deeply rooted in history and seen in hundreds of thousands of isolated, traditionalist villages. The villages' social structure has been reinforced by the specifically Hindu caste system, and perpetuated further by the little contact villagers have had with the outside world. Traditions of toleration and a desire for consensus are rooted in the Indian past. But so too are authoritarianism, passivity, and acceptance of the status quo. However much consensus was sought within a joint family or caste, society was organized on hierarchical lines; the roles and duties of rulers and ruled were strictly laid out.</p>
                        <p>Pre-British Buddhist and Hindu India created no enduring political philosophy and established no notable political tradition. Democracy, or even something that might appear to have been a precursor, was unknown. Government was traditionally absolute and arbitrary.<note n="9" xml:id="d165fn9" type="source">It was also frequently benign and paternalistic. The outstanding model of the benevolent autocrat was the famous Emperor Asoka, who ruled in the third century B.C.</note> Nor did government authority extend very far. Geographically, the entire subcontinent was never, throughout history, under the control of a single Hindu ruler. No Hindu empire of any magnitude has existed since the sixth or seventh century A. D. Nor did such states desire, seek, or get anything approaching widespread public support or emotional allegiance from their subjects.</p>
                        <p>The Muslim conquest of a large part of the subcontinent began about A.D. 1000, and ushered in, for many of that area's Hindu inhabitants, a time of exploitation, oppression, and tragedy. Government, more than in the past, became to them a foreign, hostile, and oppressive institution.<note n="10" xml:id="d165fn10" type="source">Another major legacy of Islamic rule was the creation of large Muslim minorities in the subcontinent, and ultimately the separation of the area into two (now three) countries: India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This paper is principally concerned with the problems of the present Republic of India, though its two Islamic neighbors share, in differing degrees, many of its assets and liabilities.</note> By the end of the 18th century the British had taken over, substituting another autocratic and foreign, though more benign, rule. The British with their own traditions of limits on authority also introduced a number of ideals and practices designed to protect the citizens from their rulers, and to ensure them a greater measure of individual liberty against the state.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d165-09" facs="d165-09"/>
                        <p>When India became an independent country, both its citizens and its rulers had inherited deep-seated attitudes toward government and authority. Government is a suspect and outside force, latently hostile, and to be resisted. It is also a fairly remote entity for most people, and more often than not of no immediate or direct impact. This wary attitude is, in practice, shared by those in positions of authority in democratic India and by the general run of the citizens.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The central ingredient in Indian life is social indiscipline, a refusal to compel and a refusal to respond to authority. Government at all levels is reluctant to make demands on its citizens; when demands are made, they are indifferently enforced. Those that are meet an unvoiced, unyielding resistance, rooted in a deep skepticism of the demands legitimacy and intent.<note n="11" xml:id="d165fn11" type="source">Bernard D.

                        <p>While this “refusal to compel and refusal to respond” has played a large role in perpetuating the genuinely liberal and democratic society which India maintains, it has also made the Indian government a comparatively weak one—a “soft state"—reluctant or unable to impose its will on a resisting electorate. There are many well-known examples. Untouchability was abolished in the Indian Constitution of 1950, but continues to be observed in the nation's villages. Complex and ambitious economic plans have been carefully formulated but only incompletely implemented. This is not to say that the state is “weak” in that it cannot assure its own survival. It can, and functions well within bounds. But it is unable to command the type of total mobilization or commitment available to, say, the Japanese, Chinese, or most West European governments.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>These attitudes, however much conditioned by deep-seated cultural patterns and long historical experience are, of course, not unique to Hindu India; they are common throughout the underdeveloped world. But the present Indian government—probably to a greater degree than those of most Afro-Asian states—has been greatly affected by Western values as well. The impact of the British who first came to India early in the 17th century was probably the most important and enduring of any foreign invader in India.</p>
                        <p>The British unified the subcontinent for the first time in history, developed an administrative structure which still continues, and gave it a better form of government than it had known before. Economically they tied it together, and developed systems of trade and finance. Legally the British brought India a uniform code of justice and the concept of liberty under law. Also of great consequence was their educational/social/cultural impact. Not merely did the British bring India in contact with the whole range of Western thought; they created a new class of people. These people were not exactly, as Macaulay prophesied, “Indians in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinion, in morals and in intellect.” But the impact of Western ways on them was very great. These persons, over the 19th and early 20th century, became the new Indian elite in commerce, business, industry, and eventually in the administration, government, and military services as well.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d165-10" facs="d165-10"/>
                        <p>This group, Western-influenced and mostly though not entirely English-speaking, still occupies a pre-eminent place in India. It remains comparatively small (only a few million people), able, and to date not seriously challenged. Its commitment to maintaining political liberty and democratic rule remains strong. But pre-eminence is not dominance. Indeed, the Western democratic traditions by which India has been so strongly affected have reinforced deeper seated views as to the necessary limits on government and authority. It is also true, of course, that India's ruling class is not a totally cohesive, a homogeneous, or a like-minded group. The economic and social outlook of, say, businessmen, generals, government administrators, and political party leaders differ widely. Their ties with the mass of Indians vary considerably. But whatever the specific case, this small ruling elite has shown itself as far more capable of dominating the political system and of maintaining its own position than in transforming the rest of India's society and economy.</p>
                        <p>The Indian political system is strongly influenced by Western democratic political thought and is also generally accepted by rulers and ruled alike. The country functions under a written constitution. Jurisdictions are organized on federal lines. There are now 21 states and several lesser territories, mostly organized on linguistic lines. Though the Indian constitution gives the states some real power, e.g., their exclusive jurisdiction in agricultural taxation, the central government is so strong as to call into question the federal concept itself. The constitution allocates residuary power to the national government (usually referred to as the “Centre”). It permits the central parliament, by a simple majority, to form new states or redraw state boundaries without the consent of the states affected. The central government, if it so chooses, can declare an emergency and dismiss any state government and take over its administration. Its dominant position has been further reinforced by its commanding role in economic planning, commercial regulation, fiscal administration, foreign policy, defense, and communications. At the same time, the state governments have not withered away; rather they have developed extensive bureaucracies and in practice are responsible for much of the day-to-day administration (including executing the basic directives of the Centre) in the country.</p>
                        <p>India is a parliamentary democracy. Real executive authority is exercised, as in England, by the Prime Minister (in the states by the Chief Minister) who is chosen from, and responsible to, the popularly elected lower house of Parliament. (Each state has a Governor and India has a President, all of whom resemble the present British monarch in being symbolic heads of state without real power.) There is also a separate and independent judiciary, but in the last analysis the national parliament, and particularly the lower house—the Lok Sabha, or House of the People—is the supreme power in India. Members of parliament and of the state legislatures are chosen in free elections. All citizens 21 and older are eligible to vote. Elections to each legislative body must be held at least every five years, but can come at shorter intervals if special elections are called.</p>
                        <p>The Congress Party has been the dominant political institution within this constitutional framework. Established in the late 19th century, transformed by Gandhi into the leading force in attaining Indian independence, and then forged by NEHRU into his instrument of rule, Congress remains the only major national party in India, despite its many rivals. It has deep roots and many able leaders. It continues to espouse NEHRU's popular goals of pressing for a moderate democratic socialism, of seeking <pb n="11" xml:id="d165-11" facs="d165-11"/>to develop a planned economy which will put an end to the country's massive poverty, and of fostering orderly social change.</p>
                        <p>For all its strengths, Congress has long had many serious problems.<note n="12" xml:id="d165fn12" type="source">In late 1969, the Congress split into two parties. A smaller faction, led by more conservative state party leaders, seceded after failing to oust Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>. This group was almost wiped out in Mrs. Gandhi's smashing election victory in March 1971, and her faction is now de facto the ruling Congress Party.</note> It has never been able to get a majority of the popular vote in any national election; the most it achieved was in 1952 and 1957, when it got 45 percent and 48 percent of the vote. It has been able to win its very large parliamentary majorities because of the divisions among is opponents. Thus in most constituencies the Congress candidate, with 30-40 percent of the vote, will win because his opposition is divided between three, four, or more rival candidates.<note n="13" xml:id="d165fn13" type="source">Mrs <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s wing of the Congress triumphed in 1971 with 43 percent of the vote, enough to get a two-thirds majority in Parliament.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>None of the opposition parties now existing could produce a viable alternative government to the Congress. There is no nationwide opposition but rather many small factionalized groups, usually with supporters in specific areas of the country. Opposition parties with specific ideological appeals, e.g., the right-wing free-enterprise Swatantra Party, or the Socialists and Communists on the left have notably failed to develop major, nationwide constituencies. This means that India's political future lies with the Congress Party. Even when it loses its legislative majority, as has often happened in a number of states and once at the Centre, the Congress usually remains the largest group and becomes the leading force in a viable coalition. This fact has in turn reinforced Congress' long-standing propensity to maintain ambiguous stands on many important political and social issues. In one sense, this adaptability to a wide range of views enables Congress to continue as a moderate, centrist institution showing a considerable tolerance for conflicting opinions and embracing and accommodating different castes, interest groups, communities, and regions.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, its heterogeneity and consequent indiscipline inhibit strong actions. For example, many local Congress leaders in the states and smaller jurisdictions are prosperous landowners and businessmen who are not in sympathy with the socialist and populist programs of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> and her entourage, even though she (like her father before her) has been able to force overt, official party adoption of her policies. Peasant proprietors have effectively prevented the passage of effective land reform legislation—strongly advocated by Mrs. Gandhi—in the state legislatures. Regulations designed by NEHRU to restrain monopolies and abuses of economic power by businessmen have been converted by national and state bureaucracies into restrictive and time-consuming regulations (often manipulated by unscrupulous plutocrats) that tend to throttle economic activity.<note n="14" xml:id="d165fn14" type="source">“According to a recent study by the Indian Planning Commission, it takes nearly four years for an Indian businessman to run the gamut of regulations and start a business.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> is not just a shadow ruler. Domestically, she has shown enormous talent in political survival, in the dispatch of her rivals, and in the winning of elections. In the exercise of foreign policy, where she has a comparatively free hand, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has shown considerable force, purposiveness, and skill. But in the management <pb n="12" xml:id="d165-12" facs="d165-12"/>and administration of the government and economy, she is in the restrictive, “soft state” tradition of Indian political life, and her record is less impressive.<note n="15" xml:id="d165fn15" type="source">There is one area where Congress' reformist achievements have been substantial, but of unexpected consequence. Educational facilities have been greatly expanded and illiteracy has dropped. While doubtless improving the quality of human resources, this program has also produced a massive new class of disaffected students and ex-students. Thus there are now 2.5 million university students in India, as compared to 300,000 in 1950. Many have no hope of finding suitable jobs; they now form the core of an alienated and effective protest force.</note> While able to win a rousing mandate on the issue of “abolishing poverty,” she has not in fact been able to do much toward achieving that aim. Nor is she likely to be able to exert much more of an impact on Indian society. Her control of the economy, and even of the bureaucracy, is not commanding. The resistance to the exercise of strong authority which characterizes India from the village level up to the national government itself is probably too deeply built in to national life to permit any major change.</p>
                        <p>Barring major, fundamental social and political changes, these inhibitions would apply to any successor who led another Congress government. They would apply even more if Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> passed from the scene, Congress lost its parliamentary majority, and India were ruled by a coalition government.<note n="16" xml:id="d165fn16" type="source">Such coalitions have ruled in many states. While they have shown the same sort of transient nature as seen in Italy today and in France several years ago, they have not done a bad job overall. The bureaucracy has continued functioning, civil liberties have been respected, and law and order maintained.</note> They would probably also be much the same were the present constitutional political system to be replaced by a “stronger” one, say a military dictatorship, whose leaders would come from the same milieu as the present civilian rulers. The institutional inhibitions in that huge and complex country make sustained and efficient central direction an improbability. This state of affairs will remain a source both of India's strength and of its weakness. The social and political system is likely to remain responsive to popular demands and resistant to tyranny. But it will perpetuate immobility and inefficiency.</p>
                        <p>C. The Economy: Political Implications</p>
                        <p>India is so big that aggregate statistics are impressive. GNP in 1973 was $56 billion, eighth largest in the world. India produces between 6 and 7 million tons of steel a year, has large textile and food processing industries, and manufactures many other items up through and including jet aircraft. According to the 1971 census, it has nine cities with more than a million people.</p>
                        <p>For all that, India in the aggregate remains a rural, very poor country. Seventy percent of the people are engaged in agriculture. Per capita annual income is less than $100 a year. By the Indian government's own reckoning, 40 percent of the people live below a “poverty line” which is set at the level of barest subsistence. By Western standards there is widespread unemployment and underemployment though there is no ready way of precisely measuring them.<note n="17" xml:id="d165fn17" type="source">As stated in the US Embassy, New Delhi, Airgram, 25 December, 1970: “There are no reliable estimates of India's labor force—rough guesses place it as high as 210 million—nor of the total number of unemployed. Employment statistics are maintained only for the so-called 'organized sector' of the economy, which employs less than 10 percent of the total labor force and includes government employees and those working for Central and State Government enterprises and larger private firms, but excludes virtually the entire agricultural sector (which accounts for nearly 50 percent of India's GNP) as well as private firms employing less than ten workers and those who are self-employed. Except for the organized sector, there is simply no adequate measure of employment, unemployment, or underemployment in India. Estimates of unemployment vary from 10 to 50 million, and of underemployment from 100 to 170 million.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d165-13" facs="d165-13"/>
                        <p>Despite the pervasiveness and depth of India's poverty, there has yet to appear anything like a major revolution of rising expectations. Most people are “have nots,” but they have not rebelled against the comparatively small group of businessmen, landowners, intellectuals, and bureaucrats who form what in effect is a “ruling class,” however heterogeneous it itself may be. But populist appeals including attacks on entrenched privilege, promises of land reform and redistribution, nationalization of banks, big business, and the like have indeed aroused public response. Prime Minister Gandhi, like her father, uses such appeals to great effect in seeking and maintaining mass political support, though, of course, implementation has been another matter.</p>
                        <p>Throughout history, feeding itself has been a major challenge to India, and one that has not always been met. Famines were common, even regular, occurrences up through the end of the 19th century, though the record since has been a fairly creditable one. On an average (variations occur each year) food output has increased at about 3.9 percent a year in the last two decades while the rate of population increase has been 2-2.5 percent. Even so, the country has usually not been self-sufficient in food. It is the thesis of this study (Section II) that the food/population problem will be the prime source of India's difficulties over the next decades.</p>
                        <p>Economic growth and development has long been fostered by the Indian government. While agriculture has recently received heavy attention, for years the principal concentration was on the industrialization of the country. In economic terms (the details of which are outside the scope of this study) the results have been mixed. Few of the ambitious targets have been achieved, and most new state-run enterprises are operated very inefficiently. But a considerable number of projects have been completed and there is substantial industrial production. These new industries, however, have not succeeded in absorbing the large number of people who have entered the labor market thanks to population growth and the spread of underemployment in the countryside. They have in the main benefited those comparatively small groups of people who were already members of India's elite: the bureaucrats, the members of the small middle class, the businessmen and the like. But the new industries have probably accelerated the growth of urban centers and fostered unrest in them by attracting far more potential employees and service personnel than the newly expanded cities could make use of. For all the new opportunities they have provided, the government's economic development programs have not produced an economic boom which has trickled benefits down through the society. In these circumstances neither a period of rapid industrial growth nor of recession is likely on its own to have the sharp, immediate political impact that would be seen in more advanced, industrialized countries.</p>
                        <p>Like the US, India is a large continental power with many natural resources of its own. Unlike Japan, it does not normally depend on foreign trade—which it heavily regulates—for its existence. Yet in years of severe food shortages India has had to import large quantities of food for which it could pay only on generous concessional terms. Until the recent boost in petroleum prices, India had, for a few years, been able without foreign assistance to import items needed to keep the economy going, however inefficiently. As of the summer of 1973, India's imports and exports were, in relation to GNP, comparatively small. They were also running roughly in balance, and amounted (in the year ending April 1973) to about $2.5 billion each. Most exports were of commodities: tea, jute, cotton, iron ore, as well as textiles and a small amount of manufactured goods from its new industries. Imports included food, machinery, <pb n="14" xml:id="d165-14" facs="d165-14"/>and some industrial raw materials. They also included commodities India needs, including most non-ferrous metals, some fertilizer, and petroleum.</p>
                        <p>India's economic development programs have had some specific international political consequences. A large part of the development effort has been financed by foreign borrowing, and India is now one of the world's major debtors. By early 1974 India's total external debt—to the US, the World Bank, the principal non-Communist countries, the USSR, and Eastern Europe—approached $5 billion.<note n="18" xml:id="d165fn18" type="source">An additional $4 billion obligation to the US, in rupees for PL-480 shipments, is not included in this total.</note>   It owes the US alone over $3 billion, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> over $1 billion. These sums are beyond India's ability on its own to repay, and it must either get more aid to repay what was previously owed or seek a moratorium on debt repayments. Either course could have major consequences in so far as India's relations with its many aid donors are concerned. In India itself the whole subject of foreign aid has become a highly controversial one. Some claim such programs have done more harm than good and should be ended quickly. Others insist that India is still heavily dependent on outside assistance, and must seek it with heightened vigor.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">D. The Energy Crisis</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The recent surge in world oil prices could hurt India badly—a fact which has been widely publicized. During 1973, India spent $484 million on oil imports. Following the price increases by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries (OPEC) in January 1974, it was expected that (without some form of relief) these costs would go up to $1.2 billion a year, about a third of its projected export earnings. Food output would be hurt by fertilizer shortages brought on by reduced supplies of, or inordinately high prices for, petrochemical feedstocks needed in India's own fertilizer plants, as well as by the worldwide shortage of fertilizers made elsewhere from petrochemical feedstocks. It is still too early to say how much fertilizer availability will fall, and how disastrous an impact this will have. Some experts (including the US Agricultural Attache) have predicted that a combination of drought and fertilizer scarcity will lead to a drop in food output in 1974 of 10 percent below what had been expected.</p>
                        <p>Without diminishing the seriousness of the threat posed to India by the present energy crisis, its impact either in the short or the long term will not inevitably be as severe as some have predicted. Though not certain of success, New Delhi can hope to ease the import cost burden both by getting oil at reduced concessiorial terms from its wealthy OPEC friends in the Persian Gulf (it has already signed agreements with Iraq and Iran which could reduce its petroleum bill by $200-300 million in 1974), and by getting additional financial aid from the World Bank and various outside powers. To date, the Soviets have been helpful in agreeing to provide further assistance in increasing output of existing fields and in discovering new ones. They have also agreed to provide one million tons of kerosene and 100,000 tons of diesel oil.</p>
                        <p>India may have the potential for self-sufficiency in energy over the longer term. It already has the refineries needed to process the oil it consumes. It now produces a third of its petroleum needs despite the fact that it has been relatively indifferent to exploration for further reserves. The Indian government, socialist and nationalist if not xenophobic, and particularly suspicious of large foreign corporations, has until recently refused to permit Western (including American) oil firms to explore for oil <pb n="15" xml:id="d165-15" facs="d165-15"/>either onshore or offshore. Many promising areas have not been explored at all. Some new finds of petroleum have been made with Soviet assistance, but much more could be done.</p>
                        <p>Nor is petroleum India's primary source of energy. Over 40 percent of the country's needs are met (mostly in the villages) by such as cow dung and firewood. Coal provides about another 40 percent, principally to the advanced sectors of the economy. Oil meets only 10 percent of the nation's requirements, and the rest is provided by hydroelectric power and nuclear fuels.<note n="19" xml:id="d165fn19" type="source">Petroleum consumption now runs between 400,000 and 500,000 barrels per day.</note> India has large coal reserves and now produces nearly 80 million tons a year. Doubling that figure in a few years would be feasible—provided there is proper planning, investment, and management. Over the longer term nuclear power has a considerable potential. Two nuclear power plants are under construction and two are in operation. The country has large supplies of thorium, and a lesser amount of uranium. It has the scientists and the knowhow to develop these resources.<note n="20" xml:id="d165fn20" type="source">A useful review of India's energy problems is to be found in Marcus F. Franda, “India and the Energy Crunch,” American Universities Field Staff, MFF-1-74. See also Link Magazine, 6 January 1974.</note> Whether the Indians will be able to exploit their potential and achieve self-sufficiency in energy is, however, another matter. For example, the entire coal industry has recently been nationalized, and the record of state-owned industries over the years has been very unimpressive. Indeed there have already been so many shortfalls in achieving goals theoretically within reach in the energy field (and in many aspects of the economy) as to make any such judgments very cautionary.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>India's international role reflects its paradoxical mixture of strength and weakness. With well over a half billion people, it is impossible to ignore entirely. Its army of over a million men is the third largest in the world. Though its technological base is small as compared to most industrialized countries, its development has reached the stage which permitted it to manufacture and explode a nuclear device; it can proceed to make its own nuclear weapons. Though it no longer enjoys the great prestige it had during NEHRU's day, India remains one of the major leaders of the third world, nonaligned countries. It is a principal Indian Ocean power and could extend its influence to the adjacent Persian Gulf. If the size of the naval forces of the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are increased in the area, India, with a navy of its own, will automatically figure more importantly in strategic considerations.</p>
                        <p>India is a direct neighbor of China. It has fought one war with that country, has unresolved border claims against it, and remains one of its central rivals and competitors in Asia. For this and other reasons India has become a close friend of the neighboring Soviet Union—as the recent Brezhnev visit to India showed. India figures large in the Soviet Union's strategic thinking as an element to use to counter China, as an integral part of the Asian Security Pact which the Soviets have advocated, and as a force for stability in South Asian and surrounding areas.</p>
                        <p>India's potential to make trouble in South Asia itself is considerable; its military forces are superior to any other in the subcontinent. India is involved in intense rivalries, which have brought wars in the past, with Pakistan. Through its continuing <pb n="16" xml:id="d165-16" facs="d165-16"/>hostility toward Islamabad, India is involved with latently serious contests with Iran, a strong supporter of Pakistan and a guarantor of the latter's territorial integrity.</p>
                        <p>But there are distinct limits to India's international importance. Even were it to enjoy economic health and an effective forceful government, India's direct impact on the principal non-Communist powers would not be very great. It exports no commodity like petroleum or copper which they deem essential. It, and its South Asian neighbors, live in an area considerably isolated in a strategic sense from the US, Western Europe, and Japan. In the Indian Ocean area, New Delhi's military/strategic power will remain limited. Its fellow nonaligned powers now pay less attention to it than in Nehru's day. Even a healthy India would remain a poor one; it would not be able to take any world economic initiatives of its own. Even so, India remains: huge, potentially troubled, possibly strong, probably impossible to disregard.</p>

                        <p>Though Indian statistics must be treated more as rough approximations than exact guides, there are now somewhere between 550 and 600 million Indians.(21)<note n="21" xml:id="d165fn21" type="source">According to the official census, the population was 547.9 million in April 1971. Since then the number would have increased to some 590 million. The area that is now India had 238 million people in 1901.</note> The annual rate of increase is somewhere between 2.2 and 2.5 percent, or possibly higher. Though this may be a small percentage as compared to, say, some Latin American countries, the result—given the existing large number of people—is a massive population explosion. Thus there are at least 13-14 million more people each year; if the present rate of growth continues, there will be a billion Indians by the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>The Indian government has long recognized the need to check this rapid population growth. Since the mid-1960s it has pushed an extensive nationwide campaign, not just by exhortation, but also by promotion of such techniques as sterilization, loops, and other contraceptives. There is no objective way of measuring the program's effectiveness. Some observers believe that a good start has been made; others claim the program to be generally a failure, both because of the government's limited efforts and a widespread apathetic response. Though preliminary census figures tentatively indicate some successes, no dramatic victories have been or can be achieved for many years in the best of circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Health and sanitation programs have greatly reduced the death rate, particularly among children and child-bearing women. This had led to a rapid increase in the proportion of the population in child-bearing ages; according to the 1971 census, 50 percent of the population was then under 20 years of age, and 42 percent was under 15. But fertility patterns have not changed much, and traditional cultural preferences for many births to offset anticipated deaths continue to prevail. The Indians have projected a hoped for, gradual reduction in growth rate to about 1.6 percent by 1981. Even were this probably unrealistic target to be achieved, the country would in that year have only from 30-70 million fewer people than if the rate continued at 2.2 to 2.5 percent—not a huge number in Indian terms.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Efforts to feed this mass of people have been more successful than programs to slow its growth. Except in a few bumper years when the rains were excellent. India has not been self-sufficient in food since it became an independent country. But it still has been able to raise food production substantially, roughly doubling it in the past two decades. Increases in the 1950s were due largely to much new land being brought under cultivation, and to completion of some major dams and irrigation projects. In the latter part of the 1960s following a serious period of stagnating (and in two years, declining) output, good weather and the “Green Revolution” brought dramatic new gains in food production. This was limited principally to wheat. New strains were grown in northwestern India. Improved water-control measures were applied to already irrigated lands, and, with government promotion, so were large amounts of fertilizer.</p>
                        <p>By the end of the crop year ending in June 1973, wheat output was double what it had been six years earlier, but still accounted for only about a quarter of India's total foodgrain production of some 100 million tons. By contrast the output of India's other principal foods—rice, pulses, sorghum, etc.—had risen only modestly. Though about a fifth of the sown land is now irrigated, most crops still depend on the rains from the annual monsoons. These are highly variable, and poor monsoons with less than average rainfall and reduced food output recur every few years. To date the Indians have been able to import enough food in poor crop years to make up the gaps caused by inadequate rains. These achievements have led to only modest improvements in living and nutritional standards, however. Most of the gains, of course, were literally eaten up by India's rapidly growing population, and the bulk of the people remain ill-fed.</p>
                        <p>Even without widespread demands for a better way of life, India must continue to increase food availability just to provide a subsistence diet for 13 to 14 million new citizens each year. The added food must come either from additional imports or increased domestic production. Though there is little new land which could be brought under cultivation, there is nothing in a technical sense to prevent India from increasing food output many times over. Large areas of the country now being dry-farmed would have to be brought under irrigation. Existing irrigation systems would also need to be improved. The use of fertilizer would have to be sharply increased. Higher yielding, more adaptable strains of rice and some other crops would have to be developed to fit India's wide range of growing conditions.</p>
                        <p>Given India's highly creditable past record (achieved in part by using such techniques), there are many grounds for optimism for continued good performance. Indeed, the Indian government has shown both dedication and determination in pursuing measures to ensure enough food for its people.</p>
                        <p>But there are some factors pointing to the danger—even the likelihood—of a Malthusian crisis in India in the years ahead. Among these are:

                                    <p>The quantitative factor. India's steady population growth and the large increases in absolute numbers rather than just in percentage terms makes the problem of feeding the country a more formidable one each year. Today India has nearly 600 <pb n="19" xml:id="d165-19" facs="d165-19"/>[CHART: INDIA: Population and Foodgrain Production]<pb n="20" xml:id="d165-20" facs="d165-20"/>million people, as opposed to 439 million in 1961, or 361 million in 1951. By the early 1980s, the population will be approaching 700 million, not as large as that of China but still a formidable volume. To feed these additional people, it must invest in more numerous irrigation projects, fertilizer plants, extension services, and transportation networks than it has in the past. Given the fact that state-to-state economic aid programs to India are now declining and that future prospects for large increases are poor, it must do so more and more out of its own resources. If domestic production does not meet demand, it must seek imports which, in absolute rather than percentage terms, would be very large.<note n="22" xml:id="d165fn22" type="source">In calendar year 1951, India imported nearly 5 million tons of foodgrains to cover shortfalls. In 1966, it received over 10 million tons. These were, respectively, 10 and 14 percent of the food grown domestically in those years. Were India to need, say by the early 1980s, emergency imports of equivalent percentages, this could amount to requirements of 15 million tons or more.</note>

                                <item>India's own past record. Despite its many achievements in raising food output, India has not been able, except in a few bumper years, to meet its own production targets. This has been true also of its efforts to increase the manufacture of fertilizer, and to put more land under irrigation, thereby reducing the country's dependence on the weather.<note n="23" xml:id="d165fn23" type="source">For example, the most recent Five Year Plan (1969-1973) postulated food output in 1973-74 at 128 million tons. Actual attainment may be about 105 million tons. Failure to expand irrigation has long been a major constraint in achieving a high growth rate, not only in foodgrains but in other crops as well. The Indian government estimates that achievement in expanding irrigation during the same Five Year Plan was three-quarters of the goal, while expert observers, including a former Minister of Irrigation and Power, estimate performance was about half of the goal. Although expenditures were made at the planned rate, physical achievements fell short as sharply rising costs forced cutbacks in the number of new irrigation schemes initiated.</note>

World stocks of grain are currently small, and whether they will be rebuilt to pre-1974 levels remains uncertain. Imports of the volume India could need might be impossible. World supplies of fertilizer could also remain tight. India will not be the only country in the world with too many people and too little food. Increasing demand may push international prices up to the point that India, poor to begin with, could not pay for the food it needed even if it were available.</item>

                        <p>This is not to say that India will inevitably fall prey to a food/population disaster, either in the short or long term. Given the wide range of variables and uncertainties, long-term projections of Indian foodgrain production cannot be made. But the obstacles to avoiding a crisis are clearly present. Given the number and nature of the challenges the Indian government must face, these obstacles are becoming more formidable. Barring new technological breakthroughs or spells of exceptionally good weather, the danger will grow as the end of the 1970s approaches. During this period, the cumulative stresses brought on by the population pressures and food scarcities, which are already making their impact, are likely to affect India greatly; a monsoon failure would bring a crisis. The following section discusses some ways in which these could be manifested in political terms.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">C. The Political Impact</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The likely political consequences of a series of famines are not easily predicted. Historically, famines in India and elsewhere have led to passivity rather than to disruptive protest. While this could again be the case in the event of widespread mass starvation, there are lesser gradients of famine which would be more conducive to political troubles than to human mortality. Indeed this is already occurring. Until roughly the 20th century, famines occurred in India every year. But they were regional, even local. Some areas had droughts and the less fortunate perished while their neighbors, even a few miles away, were enjoying a surplus.</p>
                        <p>Only after the British installed an efficient administration, covered the subcontinent with a national rail and road network, and brought the entire country into a monetary economy could mass starvation deaths be ended.<note n="25" xml:id="d165fn25" type="source">The British Indian government's Famine Code of 1883 signaled the beginning of a concerted attack on the problem. The last major disaster occurred in 1899.</note> Bounty in one region could then be shipped to make up for scarcity in another. “Famines” in India since then (except in Bengal in World War II) have been characterized by nationwide food shortages, price inflation, and political disruption rather than by stark human disaster in certain food deficit regions.<note n="26" xml:id="d165fn26" type="source">Some vestiges of the old ways are still seen in food scarcity periods when those Indian states which grow a surplus of food try to impose bans on shipments to states which do not have enough. Though these legal proscriptions are not decisive, major food shortages are still concentrated in specific regions (as in Bihar in 1967 and western India in 1973) which feel the effects far more severely than other areas.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this sense India in the past year has experienced food shortages which have led to famine-like conditions, including price rises, local scarcities, and widespread public unrest. It is likely over time to experience more, and on an increasingly serious scale. In these circumstances more and more people will be struggling for what, in relative terms, will be less and less. Without major improvements in food supplies, the country would eventually see a change from coping with increasingly painful shortages to facing the threat of mass starvation.</p>
                        <p>How would these grave human difficulties most likely be translated into political issues and contests? The politics of protest in a democratic India (and in its immediate neighbors) over the past decades does provide some clues as to what could occur. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Congress, leading the fight for independence, <pb n="22" xml:id="d165-22" facs="d165-22"/>embraced—through alliance or membership—most leaders and political groups throughout the country. Even then, it experienced dissent and defections; these have continued to the present day. In many instances the departures resulted from personal disputes and reflected only slight disagreement in ideas and methods, but in others they indicated more basic dissent. Over time, the Communists and the Muslim League split off. After independence Congress found (and still finds) itself being challenged by a number of lesser groups. In some cases their disagreement has been drawn on ideological, economic, and class lines. In others the differences were essentially communal, cultural, or regional. In both instances there are overtones of the have-nots assailing the haves, of those with grievances challenging the ruling establishment. In worsening times this pattern is likely to be repeated, but on a more intense scale, with regional, communal or class grievances being woven into protest movements characterized by demands and methods of a more extreme and anti-democratic nature.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                                <p>Regional Differences. These would play an important part. While strong national loyalties and a sense of Indian identity have taken deep root, India's people still speak several hundred different languages. There are 14 official ones, and of these only 10 or 12 are of real importance. The struggle over which, if any, should become the “national” language has been protracted, sometimes violent, and undecided. Though analogies are often misleading, roughly the same percentage (40 percent) of Indians speak Hindi (and closely related tongues)—the most widely used local language and the main candidate for becoming the national one—as the residents of the defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire spoke German. The latter, despite their long dominant political position, were unable to impose their control over the other nationalities. Under the shock of defeat in World War I, that empire disintegrated. More recent and closer to India geographically is the analogy of Pakistan. The residents of East and West Pakistan were fellow nationals and co-religionists, but over a span of only two dozen years the two regions became so inimical in political, linguistic, cultural, and economic terms that in 1971 they split into two separate nations.</p>
                                <p>A principal linguistic/regional antagonism in India is the north-south one. Historically the north and south were never united politically (at least not for any significant period) until the British conquest. And while the residents of each region all speak a number of different languages, the tongues of the north and those of the south have entirely different and mutually incompatible origins. The southerners speak Dravidian languages; i.e., those derived from the original, prehistoric inhabitants of South Asia. Most northern languages, Hindi included, are derived from the ones of the Aryan invaders of the subcontinent. While national sentiments are strong and north and south Indians remain united in a common nation, there remains considerable antagonism between many of them which could be exploited by protesting leaders in troubled times. Indeed, parts of south India, e.g., the state of Tamil Nadu, have already seen the flourishing of political movements demanding political autonomy or even secession.</p>
                                <p>There are other regional/linguistic rivalries as well. The residents of Kashmir—Muslims, distrustful of Hindus and of India, and long claimed by Pakistan—are a special case. So too are the many primitive tribes in northeast India (the Nagas are the best known) which have been in periodic rebellion for years. These peoples have been held in the Indian union by military force. Though they would not <pb n="23" xml:id="d165-23" facs="d165-23"/>[<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>: Language Distribution] <pb n="24" xml:id="d165-24" facs="d165-24"/>automatically rebel in times of trouble, their loyalty cannot be taken for granted. Both the Bengalis of eastern India and the Mahrattas (centered around Bombay) have some sense of separate identity and of distinct historical tradition. These have been manifested at one time or another in language riots, movements for greater autonomy, and local xenophobia.</p>

                                <p>Political Extremism. The development of radical movements in India aimed at revolutionary social and economic change are phenomena that observers have been predicting for several decades. But the predictions have not always been borne out by developments. India has had a fairly large and aggressive Communist movement since well before independence. In 1948 and 1949, the Communist Party of India (CPI) did try unsuccessfully to overthrow the government of India and seize power by violent means, but the results were disastrous to it. Failure brought widespread public alienation and effective government repression. Admitting its mistake, the CPI renounced violence as a means of seeking power, and began operating as a legal party in the early 1950s.</p>
                                <p>Its achievements since have been modest; they have amounted to electoral victories in two non-Hindi speaking states (Kerala and West Bengal) and strong showings in few others. Party membership has fluctuated from year to year, but the percentage of the electorate voting for Communists nation-wide has not changed much from the 10 percent or so of 20 years ago. Further, in the 1960s the CPI split into two antagonistic parties of roughly equal strength, and has also spawned several lesser groups. The two new Communist parties differ mainly on their ties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; one follows the traditional pattern of looking to Moscow for tutelage, while the other is rather xenophobic in its hostility to non-Indians, the USSR included. Each remains demonstrably weaker than its parent. This fact, and the less than inspiring performance of the state and local Communist governments of either faction elected in the past 20 years have tarnished the movement. The question of whether India will “go Communist” is no longer as relevant as once seemed to be the case—at least so far as these formally constituted Marxist groups are concerned.</p>
                                <p>But, as in many countries both in the developed and underdeveloped world, India has seen the emergence of various radical, activist youth groups. Most are highly politicized, but with so little formal or cohesive organization as to appear anarchic. They have been nihilist in their outlook and urban in their activity. The most significant and best known of these are the “Naxalbari Communists” or Naxalites. They say they are out to foment widespread peasant rebellion. In practice, most Naxalites have engaged in widespread terrorism in and around Calcutta. They draw their strength from that national potential for trouble—the educated, urban unemployed. The Naxalites are now of limited importance because of heavy official repression, but a few years ago were able to inflict serious blows.</p>
                                <p>Calcutta is probably not unique. Like others throughout the underdeveloped world, all of India's cities have seen a very large influx of people from the surrounding countryside.<note n="27" xml:id="d165fn27" type="source">Statistics tell the story. In 1920, 5 percent of South Asia's residents lived in cities of 20,000 or more. In 1950, the number was 8 percent, and in 1970 15 percent. Calcutta had 1.8 million in 1920, 7 million in 1969. Bombay had 1.3 million in 1920, 6.2 million in 1969. W. Howard Wriggins and James F. Guyot, Population, Politics, and the Future of Southern Asia, page 44 ff. The statistics are derived from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> sources and differ slightly from the official 1971 Indian census figures.</note> As the nation as a whole has become more overcrowded, the villages offer less <pb n="25" xml:id="d165-25" facs="d165-25"/>opportunity to make a suitable livelihood. Their surplus people move to the cities where even the most menial jobs offer them a marginal improvement in their lot. The longer term results are usually disruptive as the traditionalism of village life is eroded by urban pressures and begins to disappear. Among some of the new city dwellers, acceptance of the traditional way of behaving and believing changes into a discovery of political, economic, and social injustice.</p>
                                <p>This is particularly true among those who, thanks to the city's opportunities, are able to receive considerable schooling, to have their ambitious aroused, and who are then unable to find either a job commensurate with their expectations—or perhaps any job at all. The “educated unemployed,” disaffected and sometimes alienated, are already a serious problem in the subcontinent. Again there are few exact numbers or statistics. But the magnitude of the problem can be illustrated by the fact that 60,000 of India's 300,000 engineering graduates were registered as out of work in 1971. The number of unemployed teachers, lawyers, journalists, et al, was certainly very much higher. The ability of this group to make serious trouble for established authority has already been demonstrated in neighboring Pakistan and Ceylon, whose societies recently experienced major eruptions under stress.</p>
                                <p>There are also right-wing political extremists in India. They are generally traditionalist, ardent Hindus whose outlook is colored by authoritarianism and xenophobia. Most come from what would now be called the lower middle class; in fact, they draw their support from the shopkeepers, small farmers, and others who had an established place in traditional Indian society. Many belong to militant Hindu groups in north India and take harsh stands against all things foreign, including Communism, parliamentary democracy, the English language—and even other Indian languages besides Hindi. Their anti-Muslim biases are particularly strong.</p>
                                <p>Since well before independence, some of these right-wing extremists have been organized into disciplined paramilitary forces. They have been involved in very many anti-Muslim riots and various violent acts; one of their members assassinated Mahatma <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>. They have also, principally through the Jan Sangh party, sought power through legitimate political processes, though their achievements have been limited. In times of political tranquility they are little more than irritants, but in periods of disruption their impact would almost certainly be greater.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">The Official Response</hi>. Indian governments have been often, and justifiably, criticized as incapable of stimulating economic progress and of fulfilling promises of social reform, as enmeshed in red tape and ineffective. There is a danger of carrying this assessment too far and underestimating the capacities of New Delhi in fields where it has already demonstrated considerable strength. As noted above, it has already been faced with problems generated by regional dissent, attempted Communist insurrection, active insurgencies in tribal areas, urban terrorism, mass rioting and protests, and several international wars, among others. All have been contained and controlled, often with considerable skill and strength. However much this “soft state” has lagged in checking population growth, stimulating economic development, and solving the energy crisis, it has not failed to provide India with a functioning, legitimate political order and government.</p>

                                <p>In the following section, scenarios are presented of ways in which India's internal crises would intensify in kind and in scope. The case for such happening is a strong one. It is further postulated that the difficulties will become so severe as to cripple the power and authority of the Indian government itself, thereby permitting more widespread turbulence and disorder. The case for this happening is much weaker. Civilian (or if they fail) military authorities in New Delhi may be able to cope with problems far more severe than they have known in the past. They also may not. No confident judgment either way can be made, but the possibilities, and dangers, of failure are great enough to merit consideration of the contingency.</p>

Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have food/population problems of their own. Indeed Bangladesh's are worse than India's and turmoil could erupt there sooner, bringing another element of instability into the whole area. Sri Lanka's small size and its insularity would probably keep its difficulties from spilling over into India. Pakistan on the other hand, with a more favorable land to population ratio, and a better record in raising agricultural output, is the South Asian country least likely to be affected, at least in the next decade or so.</note>

                        <p>As an illustration, rioting could break out in one city and then spread to most other urban areas, in a manner similar to what happened in Pakistan in 1969. In various parts of the country, the initial issues might be economic and social; in others, regional or linguistic. The turmoil would sustain itself in area and scope; it would increase week after week, month after month. Normal commercial and economic activity would begin to be crippled. As official efforts at reconciliation and/or suppression fail, the dissidents' demands increase and their leaders become bolder. The police begin to lose heart and the bulk of the military would then find itself affected. The dissidents would then move from the cities to the surrounding countryside, and take over control of entire states.</p>
                        <pb n="27" xml:id="d165-27" facs="d165-27"/>
                        <p>In a second scenario, an insurgency—while led by members of the intelligentsia—would find its principal bases in rural areas. (This happened in a widespread and nearly successful uprising in Ceylon in 1971.) In the case postulated, armed insurgencies would be covertly planned, suddenly executed, and then succeed in capturing control of some areas of the country. Though revolutionary cadres would mostly come from the cities, universities, and other centers of protest, their movement would be characterized by their strength in certain substantial rural regions and by their effectiveness in conducting sustained guerrilla warfare. Some units of the police would go over to the rebels. The military, accustomed to and well equipped for fighting conventional campaigns, would be unable to suppress the insurgents. The latter would then take over more of the countryside, inhibit commercial and transport activity, and begin to disrupt activity in various cities.</p>
                        <p>In Pakistan, unexpected turmoil brought down President Ayub's government and set in train events which eventually led to the change of East Pakistan into independ ent Bangladesh. The Ceylon insurgency came close to success though it was finally suppressed. Neither of these analogies could be expected to apply precisely to the Indian case; India is quite a different country and society from either Pakistan or Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). But the kinds of crisis which struck India's immediate neighbors offer some clues about its own perils—and most of the causes of the troubles which afflicted Pakistan and Sri Lanka already exist to one degree or another in India. Under enough pressure they could erupt—and on a substantial scale. If the Indian government, say by accommodation, military suppression, or a combination of such efforts, were quickly able to restore tranquility the episode might become insignificant. If not, an Indian internal crisis would probably take on international dimensions.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The rest of the world might observe turmoil in India with detachment and a determination not to get involved. Each of the great powers would feel some strong incentives to do so. The US has no physical installation, military or otherwise, which could be threatened. Neither it nor Western Europe nor Japan has in India major investments whose security could come into question. Nor would a reduction of trade brought on by an economic slowdown have any major effect on those countries who buy from or sell to India. But, assuming that New Delhi's relations with its neighbors and the great powers have not changed much from what they are now,<note n="29" xml:id="d165fn29" type="source">This assumption may not, of course, be a valid one. The specific relationships of India, its neighbors, and the great powers could be quite different many years from now. In any event, it is valid to assume that India's relations with these countries are likely to remain of very considerable importance to all parties, whatever specific changes in attitude might have taken place.</note> most outsiders would probably feel they must watch the situation—and each other—carefully.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese would be delighted to see the Indian central government, which they have long detested, in worsening straits. But Peking could also face a decision: should it respond to pleas for arms, training, even safehaven from Indian insurgents who said they shared Chinese ideological views in a struggle against a bourgeois, reactionary Indian regime? Should it support, say through increased arms supplies, Pakistani efforts to take advantage of India's troubles? Whatever the views or sympathies of the <pb n="28" xml:id="d165-28" facs="d165-28"/>[<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>: India and Surrounding Area]<pb n="29" xml:id="d165-29" facs="d165-29"/>Chinese leaders, there would be strong pressures working on them not to interfere or to take sides.</p>
                        <p>[<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>: India and Surrounding Area]</p>
                        <p>Principally, the Chinese would have to take Soviet attitudes and reactions into consideration in deciding what to do. India has become perhaps the Soviet Union's closest friend in the non-Communist world. Government-to-government ties have become quite close; the November 1973 visit of Brezhnev to India, and the August 1971 Soviet-Indian Treaty of Peace and Friendship<note n="30" xml:id="d165fn30" type="source">This treaty pledges the two countries to mutual consultation in time of difficulty, and not to undertake any hostile acts against the other.</note> are but two examples of these links. Trade and commerce between the two have grown steadily in the past few years. Moscow probably sees India as playing a major role as a counterweight to China, as a stabilizing force in the great Asian land mass south of its own frontiers, and possibly as the principal factor in a future Asian security scheme.</p>
                        <p>A threatened disruption of India would probably bring on determined Soviet reactions. Direct military intervention in an Indian domestic crisis seems unlikely. Such a move could be counterproductive, both internationally and in India itself. But other Soviet efforts would be likely. Already the supplier of most of India's complex and sophisticated weaponry, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would accede to Indian requests for military equipment to suppress troubles. It would also probably advance such technical, economic, and commodity assistance as could be spared and was useful to New Delhi. There are precedents; emergency shipments of arms were sent from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> just prior to the Indo-Pakistani war in 1971. And though Moscow has consistently refused to accept any long-term responsibilities for aid to the India economy, it did lend two million tons of wheat to a hungry India in late 1973.<note n="31" xml:id="d165fn31" type="source">As of mid-1973, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had committed about $2 billion in economic aid, mostly for such large public-sector enterprises as steel mills and power plants.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Soviet political backing of the Indian government, and pressure against anyone else intervening or otherwise seeking to exploit the situation to India's detriment would be highly probable. Moscow would discourage (say by private or public warnings) efforts by the Chinese to involve themselves in India's troubles. An Indian crisis of sustained duration (as is postulated here) would almost inevitably increase Chinese-Soviet tensions, if only because of the deep suspicions and fear which now exist between the two Communist states. Even if all parties maintained an overtly hands-off posture, neither Moscow nor Peking could ever be sure of the true acts and intent of the other.</p>
                        <p>The reactions of Pakistan, a close friend of China and the US, and India's traditional foe, would probably become a concern of all interested parties. The threat of Pakistani intervention in a badly torn India would not be a remote one. The two have fought several wars in the past 25 years. Pakistan, the smaller and weaker, has lost all of them. The most recent conflict (1971) decisively established India's military paramountcy. India's capability to manufacture nuclear explosives further enhances its armed forces' superiority. The 1971 war appeared permanently to lay to rest Pakistan's quarter-century-old claim to Kashmir.</p>
                        <p>Whether the Pakistanis have finally renounced their emotional commitment to this long-sought Muslim territory is doubtful. They would calculate that an India torn by rioting <pb n="30" xml:id="d165-30" facs="d165-30"/>and insurrection could be so weakened that acquisition of Kashmir—either through enhanced diplomatic pressure, subversion, or even military seizure—would become feasible. In the past, Pakistani leaders— particularly the military leaders—have overestimated their strength with respect to the Indians. This propensity could reappear and encourage an added degree of recklessness. Beyond this, virtually any government in Islamabad would find itself under strong popular pressures to intervene in some way, particularly if Kashmir itself had become the scene of continuing troubles.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the nature and scope of Indian difficulties, Pakistani involvement in India's troubles could develop slowly and over a considerable period. Initially Islamabad would do little more than enjoy India's discomforts, but continued signs of weakness would bring domestic pressures for a more forceful policy—say in covertly supplying insurgents, or openly demanding Kashmir. These sentiments would not escape Delhi's attention, and Indian leaders, invoking the 1971 Soviet-Indian Treaty of Peace and Friendship, would urge the USSR to exert pressures for Pakistani non-involvement—both directly and through Pakistan's principal friends: the US, China, and Iran.</p>
                        <p>The Pakistanis in turn would seek backing from their friends. The US would certainly be approached in the hope of getting political support for its acts and a common front against its foes. Economic and material assistance would also be sought. The Pakistanis would also look to Peking, which is their principal source of military materiel, to apply enough pressure to divert the Indians from trying to counter the Pakistanis. Pakistan would surely turn to Iran as well. The Shah, with his powerful new military machine, has taken an increasingly proprietary view of Pakistani matters, and has openly committed himself to the maintenance of the territorial integrity of his neighbor.</p>
                        <p>Some of the developments postulated above are reminiscent of events which preceded the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani war. Future developments cannot, of course, be expected to duplicate the past, but the attitudes and possibly the actions of the principal actors, e.g., the governments of the US, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, China, Pakistan, and Iran, as well as of India itself would probably be somewhat similar.</p>
                        <p>The point can be made in illustrative fashion. Moscow, Peking, Washington, and other concerned capitals would all be seriously concerned were one of the following roughly sketched contingencies to apply:

                                <item>The leaders of one or more geographical regions in India get enough popular support along with defections from the army, police, and civil service to enable them to declare their independence and to fight off efforts at repression. They seek foreign recognition, supplies, and support—say from the US, China, and Pakistan. New Delhi asks for greater backing from Moscow.</item>

                                <item>A spiral begins wherein famine or near-famine conditions generate so much disorder that normal economic, commercial, and political activity is reduced to the degree that the central government can no longer provide the rudiments of public order and administration. Claimants to legitimate sovereignty over part or all of the country appear. But none has much hope, without outside assistance, of succeeding. Most ask for such aid.</item>
                                <label>d.</label>
                                <item>An insurgency suddenly erupts, sweeps through much of the countryside and many of the cities. It establishes a militant and perhaps nihilist regime dedicated to revolutionary upheaval both in India and in neighboring countries.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>Any attempt to create or play out specific scenarios is outside the scope of this study. But it is clear enough that aggravated Indian turmoil along the lines described above would generate a mix of temptation, suspicion, competition, and reaction among the principal powers. This is where India's “negative importance” to the world would surface—an importance which can be overlooked while that country, even though a member of the nuclear club, remains fairly stable and takes a passive (or largely ineffectual) role in international affairs. But in extremis, each of the great powers and the lesser ones abutting on India would be hyper-sensitive to what the other parties were doing or planning to do; each would be inclined to suspect the worst and would prepare to take countermeasures. The opportunities and incentives for one or another kind of interference in the matter would be very great; the chances of action and reaction leading to confrontation—or conflict—are large enough to merit serious US contingency study now.</p>

The Soviet Union is more restive about the fact that we are taking <pb n="2" xml:id="d166-02" facs="d166-02"/>a negative stand on the Asian Collective Security proposal. In March the soviet Ambassador said we were reactivating <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. He suggested we should join the Asian Collective Security system instead and make a public statement.</p>

The soviet diplomats are beginning to tell our chaps and opposition leaders: “You sign bilateral agreements with the Chinese (they are referring to the communiqué when our Prime Minister visited Peking) and with the U.S.; you participate in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, but what do your friends do for you when you are in trouble? The Soviets support their friends at all costs. You sign the Collective Security Treaty and you will have our support. “After the signing of the Peking communiqué, the Soviet Ambassador called me the next day. He expressed his displeasure and postponed the Prime Minister's visit to July.</p>

                            </hi>: They must have done that [in Islamabad]. It's an obsession with the Soviets to extend their influence against China. I can understand that. One way to advance their political interests in the area is to promote the Asian Collective Security system. They have no illusions about building a ring around China, but they believe they can extend their influence.</p>

                            </hi>: The Indians said at the time of the Brezhnev visit that they support it in principle. The Defense Minister or Deputy Defense Minister said in Parliament that the Soviets would supply SAM 6s or 7s to India. Afghanistan continues to receive military equipment from the Soviets. And the Soviets are arming India. India's defense budget is over $2.5 billion a year.</p>

                            </hi>: [Laughter] It's our only hope. Swaran <persName>Singh</persName> visited Kabul and a military mission followed. I had written to him before asking him to say nothing in Kabul to interfere with normalization in the Subcontinent. He sent a nice letter to me in response saying he had had a good talk with the Afghans and told them to take it easy in their relations with us. But then the military mission followed his visit. On top of that, when the Chinese announce at a banquet for our Prime Minister that they are ready to have friendly relations with all the nations of the Subcontinent, then four days later the Indians explode their nuclear device. Chou told us Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has written several letters suggesting they take a first step to raise the level of their representation.</p>

                            </hi>: No, they still have a Charge there [sic]. After our talks with the Chinese, we thought the Indians would be pleased. Then four days later - bang! It's an intriguing question. Was there Russian involvement in this? The date could have been shifted under Soviet influence. This has had a disturbing effect in Pakistan. It seems to us it is time for the U.S. to resume military aid to Pakistan. It is a good point in time. There is strong feeling against India. No one believes their peaceful intention. Even Radha Krishna of the <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> Peace Foundation disputes this. Therefore, we're in a tight squeeze. We think we have to have military aid. We propose defensive equipment at the beginning. We would define defensive as anti-aircraft SAMs, anti-tank missiles, radar coverage of our borders and submarines.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: That is totally out of the question.</p>

                            <persName>Ahmed</persName> We would also like a reiteration of the President's statement to the Prime Minister last September that the independence and integrity of Pakistan is a cornerstone of American policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: That is no problem. You want it publicly? Perhaps I can have a question planted at my next press conference.</p>

                            </hi>: I have discussed the question of military aid with many Congressmen and Senators with HAMILTON and Buchanan, with HUMPHREY, Church, Symington, Javits, <persName corresp="#p_GAE1">Griffin</persName> and Aiken. HUMPHREY, Javits and <persName corresp="#p_GAE1">Griffin</persName> all made the point strongly that they agree our position is difficult. But they said Congress doesn't make policy, the Executive Branch does. HAMILTON said that only one thing would save us — if you would make a forceful statement for military aid for Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: They want to destroy me. But I'll test that I will talk with them. I'm not the obstacle. I've always believed in military supply for Pakistan. It's absurd that the Soviets can arm India while our hands are tied. It's a massive problem, but I don't believe the Congress would let us do it. I'm going to talk to Javits. His intentions are honorable. HUMPHREY tells others what they want to hear. It's technically true that it's up to the Executive Branch, but they would raise unholy hell Have you heard of any change in attitude up there [to Sober]'?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: To join the Asian Collective Security system. That would ruin your relations with China. It would be a very risky thing for you to do - to join the same pact with India and the Soviets and give up your relations with China. What were Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s impressions during his visit to China?</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: In spite of speculations that Chou was not well, he was present during the talks with Mao and presided on the Chinese side the next day. We were told his doctors had said he could only attend for one hour but the talks went on for two.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Did you deal with Teng?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Ahmed</persName> The final wrap-up session was with Teng. The Chinese were a little more forthcoming on military assistance, although nothing sophisticated.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary. I'm glad to hear that. What are they giving you?</p>

                            </hi>: MIGs, anti-aircraft guns and tanks. First they said they could do nothing for two years because of the disruption caused by Lin Piao. We said two years was too long and then it was Mao who changed it and said we should get deliveries in 18 months. It was a <pb n="6" xml:id="d166-06" facs="d166-06"/>welcome surprise for us, after Chou had asked us to wait. But they only give us conventional weapons.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, we understand it will take a year to make the kits. Then they can refit 20 a day. It will be two and one-half years before it's done. It will help, but not much. In my message, there are two other points. The Prime Minister is visiting Moscow after President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. The Prime Minister hope's South Asia will come up during President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s trip as a main issue, not as a side issue.

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We more or less did that in 1971. We'll say something like that. I'll check with the President, but you can be quite certain that we'll say that.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: In the debate in Parliament when I referred to the President's statement during the Prime Minister's visit that Pakistan's independence and integrity is a cornerstone of American policy, the opposition leaders asked if these assurances are like the previous ones given during the Dulles era. There is a credibility problem. We can't say we have a secret understanding that you will take care of the Soviet threat. The opposition says “Look what happened in '65 and '71.”</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What sort of assurances? <persName>Ahmed</persName>: We have been thinking of the precedent at the time of the Sino-Indian conflict. You offered India an air umbrella. If India should use or threaten the use of nuclear weapons against a smaller neighbor, the U.S. would act to counter the threat, or any way you could put it. Others in the Security Council will not fall into line. Only the U.S. and UK are left.</p>

                            </hi>: We're sending our Foreign Secretary to Peking to find out about the Chinese attitude. We don't know their thinking on the Indian capability. The French won't fall in line. That leaves the U.S. and the UK. We don't know about the British. They're very sensitive about the Commonwealth.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: It's not a peaceful blast. No one has found a way to use a nuclear explosion peacefully. We haven't said a great deal about the explosion. I'm strongly allergic to placing the full weight of American prestige against an accomplished fact. It would be extremely dangerous for them to use nuclear weapons against their neighbors. They'll use it to threaten China.</p>

                            <item>SENSE OF ALARM AND URGENCY APPARENT IN CURRENT GOP QUEST FOR SECURITY GUARANTEE AND ARMS IS UNDOUBTEDLY GENUINE. WE DOUBT PAKS ARE SIMPLY PUTTING ON A SHOW IN ORDER TO ADVANCE ANY SUCH OBJECTIVE AS TO “DEVASTATE” US RELATIONS WITH INDIA, AND WE QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PAK POLICY OBJECTIVE OR WHETHER SOME ADJUSTMENT IN ARMS POLICY (E.G. PUTTING PAKISTAN AND INDIA ON SAME BASIS AS OTHER FRIENDS AND SELLING ARMS FOR CASH) WOULD “DEVASTATE” INDO-US RELATIONS. WHILE PAKS OBVIOUSLY HAVE NEVER RELISHED THOUGHT OF OVERLY CORDIAL US-INDIA RELATIONS, WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT BHUTTO REGIME WISHES THOSE RELATIONS TO BE “AS BAD AS POSSIBLE.” PAKS HAVE ON MANY OCCASIONS SOUGHT TO HAVE US EXERT PRESSURE IN DELHI ON THEIR BEHALF, AND WE DOUBT THEY CONSIDER THEIR INTERESTS WOULD BE ADVANCED BY DETERIORATION OF INDO-US RELATIONS TO POINT WHERE US LOSES ALL INFLUENCE IN DELHI.</item>

INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST, HOWEVER, HAS FURTHER SHARPENED ALREADY PAINFUL GOP AWARENESS THAT MOST OF THEIR MILITARY HARDWARE IS WORN AND OBSOLETE IN TERMS OF WHAT NOT ONLY INDIA BUT PAKISTAN'S OTHER NEIGHBORS POSSESS. WHILE BHUTTO HAS REJECTED OPPOSITION DEMANDS THAT PAKISTAN EMBARK ON ITS OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM, PRESSURE WILL BE INTENSE FOR QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN THE ARMED FORCES TO CREATE CREDIBLE DETERRENT AGAINST AT LEAST CONVENTIONAL INDIAN MILITARY THREAT.</item>

IT MAY BE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT OUR AID RELATIONS WERE NOT ESTABLISHED UNTIL EARLY 1950's AND OUR LETHAL ARMS PROGRAM HAS NOW BEEN DEFUNCT FOR SOME TEN YEARS. WE DID AND WE DO BELIEVE CENTO WAS IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES. PAKISTAN HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES VIS-À-VIS CHINA, RUSSIA, IRAN AND THE MIDDLE EAST. AS REGARDS PAKISTAN BEING ONLY SMALL AND TOTALLY UNIMPORTANT REGIONAL POWER, THIS MAY BE SO AS FAR AS INDIA IS CONCERNED, BUT NOT ALL THAT MUCH SO WITH SOME OTHERS IN THE GEOPOLITICAL SCHEME OF THINGS.</item>

                            <item>IF, AS STATED <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>, THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON RELATIONS WITH INDIA ARE IMPROVING IS THAT SINCE 1965 WE HAVE AT LEAST HAD A POLICY OF NOT SUPPLYING ARMS IN THE SUBCONTINENT, THEN IT DOES SEEM THAT IMPROVED RELATIONS WERE A LONG TIME COMING ABOUT AFTER POLICY ADOPTED. RELATIONS, IN FACT, DETERIORATED SERIOUSLY FOR LONG AFTER THE EMBARGO PLACED ON LETHAL MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO PAKISTAN AND INDIA. IT DOES NOT APPEAR US MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY IN SUBCONTINENT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN DOMINANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING DIRECTION OF US-INDIAN RELATIONS EVEN THOUGH INDIANS FOR TACTICAL REASONS OFTEN HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT APPEAR SO. THUS RELATIONS WERE AT THEIR BEST IN EARLY 1960'S DESPITE FACT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AT THAT TIME WAS STILL PAKISTAN'S CHIEF SOURCE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND HIT BOTTOM IN EARLY 1972, MORE THAN SIX YEARS AFTER WE ADOPTED POLICY OF RESTRICTING ARMS SALES TO SUBCONTINENT. IF RELATIONS HAVE BEGUN TO IMPROVE ONCE MORE, IT WOULD SEEM TO US <pb n="3" xml:id="d167-03" facs="d167-03"/>THAT IT MAY BE DUE AS MUCH TO DISSIPATION OF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'S GO-IT-ALONE RESOLVE AND 1972 EUPHORIA, INCREASING DOMESTIC TROUBLES, DISCOVERY THAT MASSIVE FOREIGN AID IS STILL NECESSARY, AND CONCERN OVER UNDUE DEPENDENCE ON <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> AS IT IS TO PRESENT US ARMS POLICY.</item>

                            <item>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS OFF COURSE FUNGIBLE. THIS WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY INDIA DURING THE 50'S AND EARLY 60'S. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, LIMITATIONS INASMUCH AS, ASIDE FROM RUSSIA, CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT CAN ONLY BE SECURED FROM THE UNITED STATES. MORE IMPORTANT, THE INTRODUCTION OF AMERICAN EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES PROVIDES BOTH A TIE AND LEVERAGE (BOTH FROM ASSOCIATION AND FROM DEPENDENCY) WHICH RECORD SHOWS WE HAVE WELL UNDERSTOOD. US EQUIPMENT IS NOW MOLDERING AWAY AND BECOMING OF INCREASINGLY SMALLER SIGNIFICANCE TO PAKISTAN AS ITS MILITARY BECOMES MORE AND MORE CHINA-ORIENTED. OUR VIRTUALLY UNCHANGING POLICY SINCE 1965 HAS WROUGHT CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN THE STATUS QUO ANTE WITH RESPECT TO OUR MILITARY TIES AND MILITARY LEVERAGE IN PAKISTAN. THIS IS DETRIMENTAL OF COURSE TO OUR POSITION HERE, AND WE QUESTION WHETHER LOSS OF INFLUENCE HERE IS REALLY IN BEST INTEREST OF INDIA.</item>

THERE IS NO REASON WHY APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ACHIEVE LATTER WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH GOOD RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN - QUITE THE CONTRARY. NO ONE SHOULD BE MORE PLEASED THAN PAKS IF THROUGH US OR MULTILATERAL EFFORTS <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WERE INDUCED TO BACK UP ITS CLAIM THAT NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS SOLELY FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES BY ITS PLACING PROGRAM UNDER SOME FORM OF INTERNATIONAL INSPECTION. THIS SHOULD, HOWEVER, NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS LONG-TERM GOAL TO BE ATTAINED THROUGH SLOW PROCESS OF PERSUASION AND INFORMAL MONITORING BUT, RATHER, AS MATTER OF GREAT URGENCY. WHILE IT WILL NO DOUBT TAKE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> CONSIDERABLE TIME TO DEVELOP SOPHISTICATED DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR ITS NUCLEAR DEVICE, INDIA - AS PAKS NOTE - ALREADY HAS THE “DELIVERY SYSTEM” TO TRANSPORT NUCLEAR DEVICES TO PAKISTAN.</item>

WHETHER INDIA WILL PRODUCE A NUCLEAR ARSENAL IS NOT THE VITAL RELEVANCY FOR IT CERTAINLY MUST BE HOPED AND BELIEVED THAT THE SAME IMPERATIVES WHICH HAVE STAYED THE HANDS OF NUCLEAR CLUB MEMBERS SINCE NAGASAKI WILL STAY INDIA'S.

WE DON'T, HOWEVER, SEE VALUE HERE OF REASSURANCES OF TYPE SUGGESTED IN REFTEL. ALSO VALUE OF ANY REASSURANCES WOULD BE GREATLY DIMINISHED IF BHUTTO WERE REQUIRED TO KEEP THEM ABSOLUTELY SECRET.

A TRUNCATED PAKISTAN HAS TURNED AWAY FROM MILITARY ROLE INTO PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY UNDER CIVIL LEADERSHIP. IT ALSO, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, HAS BEEN DOING PRETTY WELL BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND IN ITS FOREIGN AFFAIRS. UNDER <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S LEADERSHIP, IT HAS BEEN TURNING FROM THE PREVIOUS STATE OF ALMOST TOTAL BITTER PREOCCUPATION WITH INDIA, TO AN EXPANSION OF ITS INTEREST IN THE REGION TOWARDS THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST. IT HAS IN FACT OF LATE BEEN MORE DYNAMIC IN ACCELERATION OF IMPROVEMENT OF ITS STATURE AND IMAGE THAN INDIA AND WE HAVE TAKEN THE VIEW THAT THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS WOULD MAKE IT EASIER, RATHER THAN HARDER, FOR BHUTTO TO HAVE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR MOVING FORWARD UNDER THE SIMLA PROCESS TO COEXIST WITH INDIA UNDER TOERABLE RELATIONSHIPS.</item>

IN A LONG TALK WITH <persName corresp="#p_DDP2">DHAR</persName> YESTERDAY HE ASKED ME WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO ABOUT PAKISTAN. I REPLIED THAT THE REAL QUESTION WAS WHAT WAS INDIA GOING TO DO. INDIA WAS THE BIG NATION DOWN HERE, AND THE ONE WHICH HAD EXPLODED A NUCLEAR DEVICE IT WAS INDIA'S JOB TO ENABLE PAKISTAN TO LIVE WITH THIS. HE BEGAN RECOUNTING THINGS BEING SAID IN ISLAMABAD. I INTERRUPTED TO SAY THAT INDIA WAS STILL THINKING LIKE A LITTLE COUNTRY AND HAD GOT TO START THINKING LIKE A BIG COUNTRY. HE HAD BEGUN WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE BRITISH DECISION TO GRANT PARITY AS BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND “NONMUSLIMS”, THE MUSLIM LEAGUE AND THE CONGRESS PARTY, ETC.

You will no doubt already have seen the 18 June <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report [text not declassified] which arrived shortly before the memorandum was finished.

In this regard, I call your particular attention to two of our findings:

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> sent you a message on the eve of your trip to Moscow (Tab B). In this message, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> reiterated his long-held concerns about Soviet, Indian, and Afghan intentions toward Pakistan. He asked that during your Moscow visit you emphasize to Soviet leaders our support for Pakistan's territorial integrity. He also expressed the hope that, in view of India's recent nuclear test, we would soon lift our present limitations on sales of US arms to Pakistan and would provide further security assurances to Pakistan. These issues are currently under review within the US Government.</p>
                        <p>A suggested reply to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is at Tab A. It informs him that you made clear to Soviet leaders our continuing support for Pakistan's independence and integrity. The reply also informs <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> about other aspects of your talks in Moscow, particularly your discussion on Middle East issues, in which he has a strong interest.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">RECOMMENDATION</hi>: That you approve the message at Tab A. (Text approved by Mr. Gergen's office.) The message would be transmitted telegraphically to our embassy in Islamabad for immediate delivery to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I want to thank you for your message of June 24 which I received on the eve of my departure for the Soviet Union. In the spirit of the close cooperation which prevails both between our two nations and ourselves personally, I very much appreciate your sharing your concerns with me in this timely manner.</p>
                        <p>My talks with General Secretary BREZHNEV and other Soviet leaders were directed toward expanding the areas of understanding and cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union, and exchanging views on a wide range of international problems of mutual concern. While much of the focus of the talks was on strategic arms, we also had an opportunity to discuss other areas of both immediate and potential interest.</p>
                        <p>You know, Mr. Prime Minister, of the support of my Government for the independence and integrity of Pakistan and for further progress in the normalization of relations between the countries in South Asia which is so important to Pakistan's security. Having very much in mind the concerns expressed in your letter, I want you to know that I made our position clear to the Soviet leadership and pointed out the problems that would be created by any attempt to undermine Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Our talks also included discussions of the Middle East, in which I know you have a keen interest. I emphasized to the Soviet leaders that <pb n="3" xml:id="d170-03" facs="d170-03"/>we remain committed to a process of negotiation toward an Arab-Israeli peace settlement, and that we agree to a reconvening of the Geneva Conference as soon as possible, once the necessary groundwork has been prepared. I pointed out, however, that we cannot achieve a settlement in one step or in one meeting of the Geneva Conference. It remains our firm view that it is essential to formulate the issues at any given time in such a way that they can be handled politically by the parties to the negotiations. This approach also requires that careful attention be given to the timing of the negotiations on each issue so that premature consideration of an issue will not paralyze the negotiation and so that political support can be built for each decision that must be made. I believe we left Moscow with the foundation for the continued pursuit of peace in the Middle East firmly intact. While we will continue to stay in touch with the Soviet Union in this endeavor, we will also continue our own intensive effort to advance the negotiations which have been launched.</p>
                        <p>In closing, I want to say that I have deeply appreciated the opportunity to have your personal assessment of recent events in South Asia.</p>
                        <p>With personal best wishes,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>Distribution:</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Good day, Mr. Secretary. It is very kind of you to receive us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: It is a pleasure to see you. Do you mind if I rest my foot on the table? I had an ingrown toenail cut out and it is still painful. It feels better if I put it up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Not at all. I hope it is not phlebitis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: No. There are no heads of Government here. Would you like coffee or tea?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Tea. May I say that our Foreign Minister asked me to convey his warm personal regards, and to tell you how deeply he admires your efforts on detente. He also mentioned we are aware of the difference your personal and real interest has made in our relations. He looks forward to your visit. We would be very disappointed if you did not come.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d171-02" facs="d171-02"/>
                        <p>Secretary: Is Pat back there now?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I told Pat there is an unsettled situation here, as you know. I may have some problems on the timing of the visit. I will know in two weeks. If it has to be deferred, we will announce a firm date to the press, to remove any implication of constant delay.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: This would help.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Any delay would have nothing to do with foreign policy. It is simply a matter of whether I can get away. It is a matter of my schedule here in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: And what can we tell the press?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: We can repeat that I fully desire to go and that the dates are being finalized.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: You know, the Foreign Minister has made favorable statements about you in Parliament. He has mentioned you in Parliament. I will send copies to you.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Really? I have not seen them. Have you, Roy?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: No sir, although I think there was something about statements by the Foreign Minister recently.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: You know, the press people say that the Department is in league against me. They never let me see anything good about me. But when they protest about favorable press comments, this is too much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: We look forward to happy relations between our two countries. The present trend is a very good one.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I hope so also.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: I hope we can strengthen this, through the Joint Commission. The agreement should be finalized during your visit.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: As far as I know, there is only one problem of a substantive nature. We believe that each side should bear all of the expenses of any meetings hold on its territory. Your people have not accepted this position.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Are you aware of this, Roy?</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d171-03" facs="d171-03"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: I am aware of the problem, but don't know what the difficulty is on our side. It may be a problem with the GAO.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Their position makes sense. Would you check to see where the problem is? If it is with OMB, they can be overridden. If it is with the GAO, that is another matter. It shouldn't be a problem, it shouldn't cost us any more. We should go along with the Indian proposal unless there is some legal objection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Mr. Secretary. We appreciate your continuing interest in Indian affairs, and your willingness to help our Ambassador here. I understand you have been in the Indian Embassy more than all others put together.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I appreciate the opportunity to receive my good friend Tikki. He is doing a good job. He is a man of his word and dedicated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: We are impressed with his sincere and hard work.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: His job is more difficult these days. There is more criticism in the press of India.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Mr. Secretary, before coming here, I went to Canada. During my conversations there, we touched on all subjects. We spoke about nuclear matters, and India's peaceful nuclear explosion. We listened to them. They maintained there was no distinction between peaceful nuclear explosions and other types of explosions. We said the concept was an international one, and gave them assurances our intentions were peaceful. We have not gone back on our word. We wish to strengthen our relations with Canada. However, one of your remarks, Mr. Secretary, gave us a problem. You said at one time that U.S. safeguards are better than Canadian safeguards.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: That is true.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: We made it clear that this was one area where pressurization would not help them. We have internal pressures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Secretary, on most things we have agreement. On this I hope so too. Perhaps on your visit we can reach agreement on this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Can I ask a question?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Of course.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d171-04" facs="d171-04"/>
                        <p>Secretary: I don't believe in recriminations about past events. But I have wondered about the following. Intellectually, a peaceful nuclear explosion has a different meaning and significance for a developing country than it has for an advanced country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Yes?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: For example, we can establish criteria with which we can control the nature of a peaceful nuclear explosion with. precision. In the case of a developing country, one in the early stages of nuclear explosion technology, it is not possible to differentiate with this kind of precision. For a developing country, any nuclear explosion can he either peaceful or otherwise. I am just making a point here. Do you think it would be useful to have a very private discussion on means of preventing the further spread of nuclear technology beyond India? Whatever happened is past, but it is clearly in our mutual interest to do this. India clearly is militarily predominant now. But there is a curious thing about nuclear weapons. It is easy to equalize the situation if the other side develops nuclear weapons. We wish to develop a general proliferation strategy. In fact, we are having a meeting on this this afternoon. In our discussions with other countries on this, India would be treated as a nuclear power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: I think you have made a fair statement, and I can answer thusly. We would be happy to have an exchange of views.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: We have no proposals to make at this time. We are still studying the matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: One note of caution. We do not like discrimination. Discrimination like the IDA bill brings bad results.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I am totally opposed to such discrimination. You have read my testimony. I assume you are speaking of the Long Amendment? Where is that, Roy? Is it law yet?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: It has gone to the White House for signature.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I am opposed to such discrimination. I don't like what you did, but want no discrimination. It is not our policy to discriminate. On the Long Amendment, the Administration is opposed. We are not interested in seeing it implemented with concrete results. The amendment instructs the US delegate to vote against funds to India. But this vote can be overridden. We will not lobby against India within IDA. It is Administration strategy to get the discrimination against India taken out in <pb n="5" xml:id="d171-05" facs="d171-05"/>the Foreign Aid bill. Roy, Please make sure Holton and others know our views on this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: One point came up in Canada. They suggested that we should go in for nuclear power without peaceful nuclear explosives. Don't make this suggestion. On non-proliferation we are firm. Your suggestions would be welcome. But please, no pressurization.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: There is no pressure.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: This is one item.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Oh, yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: There are other things our Prime Minister wants. IDA is one. Debt rescheduling is another.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I understand the World Bank is coming up with a compromise formula.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: It is a matter of $29 million vs $64 million. You have offered $29 million. We wish an increase in the U.S. share. Otherwise the whole matter of debt rescheduling is held up. Other countries are waiting to see what the United States does.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I would support an increase.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: It would have to be at least $45-50 million. It would have to be at least this to affect decisions in such countries as the UK, Canada, Italy and Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I am seeing Secretary Simon tomorrow. I will raise this with him and let you know Monday if there is any change in our position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Then there is a recent problem with the Export Import Bank. Some loans have been turned down recently. A tire factory, I think, and some others.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Roy, do you know about this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: No sir, but I can find out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Please find out what the problem is and see if there is anything we can do.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d171-06" facs="d171-06"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Let me mention the internal economic scene now. We are in the midst of an energy crisis. We expect to spend 40% of our foreign currency allocated for imports on oil this year. If you add food and fertilizer, the figure is nearly 80%. Internally, the price of gasoline is $2 a gallon. This has affected agriculture very much. I wanted to mention this. We are having enormous difficulties. We are overhauling our priorities. Any understanding, there has been some, we appreciate. For the future, we are seeking oil deposits in our own country. We are undertaking offshore exploration. U.S. firms are involved, too, I believe. Bear in mind these matters. Our people cherish democracy. But we have problems and difficulties. You have a deep interest in India. Please consider our requirements for food, fertilizer and oil.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: When we set up the Joint Commission, we will have a systematic way to deal with these problems. In my speech at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I recognized the problem and said we would help. Now decisions have to be made on allocations by various agencies. India will have special consideration. However, we have had drought and floods in this country which may make things more difficult than we thought.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: I understand there has been some rain and that prices are already down a hit. I talked to Secretary SIMON. Food prospects are good here. We also have problems with fertilizer. We can't buy what we need. On both fronts we need help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: It is a matter of strict allocation of available supplies of fertilizer. The Foreign Secretary may be interested in knowing that, in our new bilateral cooperation efforts with the Saudis, we are giving priority to their desire to expand their fertilizer production. This will increase the amount available on the world market.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: We are doing this too, but it will take several years. We need help now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Mr. Secretary, this matter is already in your mind. Please keep it there. We have problems. Our terms of trade are not good. The trend is against India. Prices of needed imports are up drastically.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I agree India is one of those most seriously affected by the higher cost of oil and other products. India's export prices are not up.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: We cannot raise the price of something like tea very much.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d171-07" facs="d171-07"/>
                        <p>Secretary: We have undertaken a serious study of the dislocation caused by increases in oil prices. We want a solution to this problem, but don't want a confrontation with the producing countries. However, we have to help the consuming countries. If there is no solution, the results will be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: We have suggested a two or three tier price system for developing countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: This would make a negligible contribution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Even credits do not help.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: This simply compounds the problem in the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: We are trying to find oil in India. If we could get drilling platforms and drilling rigs it would help. But we have to wait so long for delivery. Perhaps the State Department could help us on this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Give us the names of the firms you have contacted and we shall see what we can do. Roy, BILL Clements ought to be able to help on this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: Let me tell you of the situation on the subcontinent. Since the Simla agreement, we have tried to build up trust with our neighbors. Our policies on POW's, movement of people and telecommunications, for instance, demonstrate this. We want to give the people confidence we are moving ahead on problems. But our relations with Pakistan are still not good. We had hoped that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s talks in Bangladesh would help. But lately, the comments we hear from Pakistan, from <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and in the press, are not good. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is not helpful. Our people have not said anything about the internal affairs of Pakistan. We have assured them about troops and troop movements. We are disturbed about comments in the press and by officials in Pakistan about India. We believe this creates hostility and ill will. People get worked up. Clashes might start. This would be crazy. The Pakistanis have encouraged problems along the Afghanistan border with arms and talk. We have appealed to Pakistan. We said we want peace and trust, we want to build up your trust. We believe this can happen if we go slowly, one step at a time. I am telling you this because I know of your deep interest in the subcontinent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I remember after your nuclear explosion, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> asked us to contact you and tell you he wanted to continue the Simla process. You responded.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d171-08" facs="d171-08"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: We have given a guarantee on the peaceful nuclear explosion. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has internal problems. India is his boogy. Some advice from you might help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: We are earnestly and sincerely willing to seek a solution to our problems with Pakistan. Apart from that, to show the direction of our Prime Minister's thinking, we have solved an old border problem with Sri Lanka. It was an old problem dating back to the days of the British. It was an emotional problem for the people of Madras. But we settled it. Some islands between the two countries were involved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Were they populated?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: No, but some of our Christian fisherman go there every year to worship. The DMK party in Madras was furious about it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Which party?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>: The DMK Party. They are a State party. They were furious about it. For three hundred years this was Madras territory. But the Prime Minister is determined to solve all problems. The problem of the Bangladesh border, 1700 miles of enclaves and uncertain boundaries, was settled. Our relations with Nepal, Bhutan, Iran and Sikkim are all improved. The Prime Minister is dedicated to building up good relations with our neighbors. Your understanding will be helpful on these matters. Mr. Secretary, we are grateful to you for giving us your time today.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Please convey my warm regards to your Prime Minister. Tell her improved relations between us will have a high priority with me. I am looking forward to my trip to India, and should be able to give you a final answer on that in two weeks, Tikki.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: There is also the question of debt rescheduling.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I shall have that answer for you next week. Mr. <persName>Singh</persName>, it was very nice to see you. I hope to see you again in India. Tikki, good to see you again.</p>

                        <p>Secretary: So good to see you again, Tikki. And who is this?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: This is Mr. Anandakrishnan, our Science Attache. I brought him along to get a glimpse of you. He wanted to be exposed to your inspiring face.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I hope he isn't disappointed. If you had said my inspiring personality, I might have believed you. Even my mother never considered my face inspiring.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: Mr. Secretary, I wish to convey the congratulations of our President, Our Prime Minister and our Foreign Minister on the democratic way in which the change took place. Please convey their felicitations and mine to President Ford. We are particularly happy to see it is the President's intention and yours to continue the present favorable trend in our mutual relations. I hope this trend will be pursued with even greater vigor and speed.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d172-02" facs="d172-02"/>
                        <p>Secretary: The President asked me to see you and express to you his very great interest in normalization of our relations. Perhaps normalization is not the right word, because our relations have been normal. Let's say improvement. The main lines of our policy will continue. We perhaps are in a better position now to act, since some of the domestic constraints are gone. Initiatives will be easier now. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> set us on a firm course. This will be continued and accelerated by President Ford. The President hopes to have an opportunity to see you next week. He had hoped to see you today, but decided he should see some Americans. It turned out he needed to call a Cabinet meeting and a meeting of the National Security Council. But the President wants to see you sometime in the next ten days. He asked me to say this to you.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: Thank you very much. I am not one of those Ambassadors who would feel slighted if he did not get the immediate attention of the President. I understand the situation. Mr. Secretary. Without taking too much of your time, may I present an Aide Memoire on Tarapur. The end result is what you want. We have agreed not to use the plutonium except for recycling purposes. The rest you can have.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Is this the first reply we have had?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: There was an earlier reply, sir, to which we have not yet replied. We are in touch with the AEC and were getting ready to respond a few days ago when other events intervened.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I assure you this matter shall be given high priority. Will you hear from Atherton before I do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: I hope not.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: For me, the transfer of authority is easy. I still get none.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: I don't believe that. Mr. Secretary, this is an important matter to us. The Tarapur plant's production is held up until this matter is settled.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Roy, can you get a recommendation as soon as possible?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: Yes, sir.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d172-03" facs="d172-03"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: Let me leave some thoughts with you. This is about Pakistan. I hope that your friendship and influence with Pakistan will be used to give a positive and constructive course to their response on our request for talks. I hope talks begin soon. There is another matter. We are a little concerned about the situation on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. We have given detailed instructions to our Ambassador in Kabul on this. There have been air intrusions of as much as 50 miles into Afghanistan by Pakistan. Our assessment is that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is using this situation as a diversion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: A diversion from what?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: The problem in Baluchistan. There is dissatisfaction there. There have been hand grenades thrown there.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I hope you are not encouraging the problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: No, we are against it. But we can't do anything. There is nothing for us to do. It is a Pakistani problem. We don't want it to be used as an excuse to delay talks with us. We are ready to start at any time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I would like to see great restraint exercised by both sides. We don't want to be in a position of being presented with difficult choices. We shall urge Pakistan to show restraint.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: Is there anything further on your visit to India?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Roy, hasn't Pat talked to the Prime Minister about this? Hasn't he asked her to fix a date?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: There was some discussion earlier about dates.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: You give us dates.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I am thinking about some firm date between the twentieth and the thirtieth of October. I really have to stay here for a bit now. The principal reason for a date in October is that I find it hard to leave now. But I have approved the fixing of a firm date.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: Yes, we should fix a firm date. There is already press speculation on this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Why don't you tell the press that the process of improving our relations will be continued and accelerated. We will continue on the same course.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d172-04" facs="d172-04"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: Can we say improved and strengthened?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Yes, improved and strengthened. Say that I have conveyed this to you.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: There is also the question of debt relief and the foreign aid bill. I saw Secretary Simon on August 5 and asked him about debt relief. He said he had gotten the message. Twenty nine million is not enough. We need more. You should understand that debt relief is more important to us than aid. The World Bank is still waiting for your reply.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I thought we agreed forty million would be enough.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: Sir, the World Bank has prepared a revised formula according to which the United States would be asked to participate at a level of about $40 million.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: Perhaps Mr. Ramakrishna can talk on this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ramakrishna: The Bank has prepared a new formula. Under this formula the lowest level of American participation would be $39 million. They still recommend the full $64 million, however. You can give as little as $39 million, but they are recommending $64 million. This would not require Congressional action.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: Until you have made a decision on this, Germany, France, the UK and Italy will not. If you reduce your participation to $39 million in the face of the Bank's recommendation for $64 million, they will reduce their participation as well.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I am seeing Simon Monday. I shall talk to him about it then.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: This would be the thing to do, Mr. Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I shall talk to him with a view to finding out what beyond $39 million can be done.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: I suggest $50 million or more. Senator Percy told me, Mr. Secretary, that the Senate will pass the foreign aid bill without amendment. There remains the problem with the House. Should I see various Congressmen?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Yes, I would recommend it. It may do some good. Our Congressional position is better now. You know what our position on this has been. Perhaps we can do something now.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d172-05" facs="d172-05"/>

                        <p>Secretary: That has not always been the case. At times, there has been opposition to me in the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>: That is not so.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: The President has sent a letter to your Prime Minister, and I have sent one to your Foreign Minister. They say we hope to continue and strengthen our relations with you. Tikki, I would like to see you for a few minutes alone. Mr. Ramakrishna, good to meet you. Mr. Anandakrishnan, glad to meet you.</p>

Our two countries can and should work together to promote understanding cooperation and peace, especially in this part of the world.</item>

                            </hi>: The Prime Minister appreciated your warm greetings. She is looking forward to an improvement of relations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>'s task when he was called from retirement was to see to this. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also works at this with characteristic enthusiasm.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> is a very effective Ambassador. He is becoming very popular in India.</p>

                            </hi>: In India your remarks have been greatly appreciated. Your idea of applying fresh thoughts. In India we don't brood—but we couldn't understand why there should be differences when there is no clash of interests. We thought the United States should want an island of stability in this one populous region, without outside influence or interference. So we were confused when we found we didn't see eye to eye with the United States.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: It is dangerous to cross India—they control half our press.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I am looking forward to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit to India. It is indicative of our wish to move closer together. I visited India in 1959 or 1960 for ten days. It was the TWA inaugural. I took a two-day train ride. I saw the Taj in the moonlight.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: I hope it was not in June or July or you had a poor impression.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Then we drove to Jaipur.</p>
                        <p>

                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: You have said what I wanted to. We too are looking forward to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit and we hope it will advance our relations. What we want to discuss is not to dwell on the past, but the future of our relations. It should be possible to have understanding between us.</p>
                        <p>We are trying in an earnest effort within our own region to solve the problems of the colonial past. Once it was all India under Britain. It takes time to resolve, but we are trying to bring about good relations among us. There were some problems with the Shah. With Pakistan <pb n="3" xml:id="d175-03" facs="d175-03"/>we are trying very hard under the Simla formula not to use force. If Pakistan responds favorably, there is a good chance for a durable peace. Compared to other bilateral areas, the two sides have got together themselves to settle the borders, prisoners of war, and other problems. In no other area have the parties themselves been able to do this. The benevolent interest of the United States has been helpful. In the past, others have looked over our shoulders and that tends to make the will to compromise evaporate.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Your way should lead to a more permanent solution. I enjoyed my visit to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: Let me give my congratulations on your speech, which touched upon basic and burning issues. You rightly said the details would be spelled out by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I discussed the controversial issues, but I didn't want to duck them.</p>

                            </hi>: Some things have to be said. Platitudes would not have done justice to the United States or the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I hope we can work together on some of the problems of Vietnam.</p>

                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: I will discuss this with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> because I think there should be cooperation. We would like to disabuse anyone of any ideas that we are committed to any country. We are committed to principles—and if we agree with the Soviet Union, it is because it is a point of our principle. The United Nations has been dominated for the past ten years on African and Middle East problems and we have strong views on these issues. But we judge our views on all matters…. President: We are trying to solve the Indochina problem as constructively as possible.</p>

                            </hi>: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> was helpful during the negotiations in passing information.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: We are grateful for that. It was harmful to the world. I would hope that if it is within your principles at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, if you could help to postpone the Khmer credentials issue.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We prefer to have a study done and then defer it to a later time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s tenacity and brilliance in negotiations has helped your country to get out of a difficult situation. It took brave decisions. Our big worry about Cambodia is that— unlike other states—there is no dialogue or even identification of negotiating parties.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We have some ideas for movement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: We appreciate the bold decision that it took for your extrication from Vietnam. We support the Paris Agreement. You phased out Laos but we are worried about Souvanna's health. We are worried about Cambodia because nothing is in sight. The Cambodian situation is different from Vietnam. But I will discuss this in detail with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We are looking forward to strengthening our bilateral relations, particularly in the economic field. We are hard hit by the oil prices. If we have to pay cash for crude oil, it will cut into our development program. We, as you said, have to keep ahead of the population increase. We don't want to depend on aid for long. We hope the progressive policies in trade which the United States supports will happen. If we can have some period of respite in payments…. this is new for the oil-producing countries; they tend to want the cash in hand. But feeding over 500 million people is a big problem. We made, with American help, great progress in the production of grain. But if there is a short fall, even if it is a marginal shortfall, its effect is disproportionately hard.</p>

                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I am pleased to see you. I look forward to my visit to Pakistan at the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We are looking forward to your visit too. It will be a very short visit, but I don't blame you. I know you are very hard-pressed. It is remarkable how much you can do.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I am very pressed for time. My program is the same in each country except for an extra day in India. I have never been there before as Secretary of State. I have had a telegram from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> conveying some concerns about my visit to India. We would like to move the Indians away from the Soviets. But we are not engaging in a reorientation of our foreign policy. You must not be rattled by our moves with India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: I had a call from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> yesterday and he asked me to convey some thoughts to you. He was concerned by reports that you had said there was a dramatic improvement in relations between the U.S. and India, and that all differences had been resolved.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I said there had been an improvement in relations and that is substantially true, although it is not so much from <pb n="2" xml:id="d176-02" facs="d176-02"/>what we are doing. We want to move them away from the Soviets. But we would never tolerate military aggression against Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: The Prime Minister also asked me to remind you of what you said in 1971, that you would teach them a lesson they would never forget. Now I know that positions change and that policies evolve. THE SECRETARY: Well, in practice, they are coming to us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: But the reverse impression has been created. The Weintraub article in the New York Times indicated that the U. S. is seeking ways to give aid to India…</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have seen that article. We have a budding novelist in our Embassy. He is busy writing chapters for his book. We are not eager to give aid to India and I would be amazed if Congress appropriated any. It was obvious that someone was talking to Embassy people. It is a classic example of masochism. We have to prove ourselves to the Indians. Even the Indians would not be so insolent as to demand that. It is an American masochistic sense of guilt that we must perform a national duty by giving aid to India. We want to create an impression and maybe the reality of greater Indian independence. We want the Soviets to understand that they get no permenent advantage anywhere when they touch something. We have no illusions about Indian policy, but their and our purposes may be served by the illusion of better relations. There are also domestic advantages in this. Internationally there is no significance, no real change.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: If I may say so, this is an old story. Twelve years ago we were told that you had to have better relations with India to prevent it from having closer relations with the Soviets. We think there is another way. You have to prove to the Indians the futility of arming themselves. This can only be demonstrated by indicating specifically what the U.S. will do in the event of an attack on Pakistan. This can also be demonstrated by supplying sophisticated arms to Pakistan. Then the Indians will realize it is futile to build up its arms.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: My going to India makes it easier to do something for Pakistan. Our problem is… It is essential that you see the President while you are here. He has already seen <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d176-03" facs="d176-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: There is another aspect. The prospect of better Sino-Indian relations.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We favor that, but the Indian action in Sikkim does not help.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: The Chinese have told us that if the Indians implement their agreement with us and Pakistan is satisfied, China will improve its relations with India. When we were in Peking, the Deputy Prime Minister said publicly at the banquet that China was ready for close and friendly relations with India. A week later - the bomb. That was a setback. And now Sikkim. Nepal and Bhutan are worried. Nepal is terribly worried. China is going to see that nothing happens to Nepal or Bhutan.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We have no great illusions about India. Perhaps that is the difference from 12 years ago. For us, the arms question is not an intellectual problem. In 1971 I did not understand how people in this government interpreted the President's orders on third-country transfers when we imposed the embargo on Pakistan. No one explained to me that it would hurt Pakistan more than India. The Government was pro-Pakistan at that time, but the bureaucracy was pro-India. To some extent that has changed now with the Indian bomb. The bureaucracy is anti-proliferation. My people will do anything but run foreign policy. I am less outraged by the Indian bomb than some. I see it as a trap for India. They will never be able to use it in practice. And if the bomb spreads, it will equalize India's military superiority.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: The French say the same thing but I do not agree. If the Indian army were in difficulty they would use the nuclear bomb in desperation as a last resort.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: They would lose the war first and very badly in my opinion. Will you beat them?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We can if we have arms. But we're not planning to do that. We just want enough to defend ourselves against India and Afghanistan who are being supported by the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have seen figures on the Afghanistan buildup. After elections I'll raise the arms question again. And you raise it when you see the President. [The Secretary then suggested to Mr. Oakley that the meeting with the President be arranged for Saturday, October 5.] It will be better if I am there.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d176-04" facs="d176-04"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: For the last three years we have been left to fend for ourselves.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I know. I am beginning to despair about domestic attitudes. Congress is now attacking Turkey, another ally. However, the mood is shifting on India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: What about the mood on arms for Pakistan?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: As I told you the last time that we met, we will work on the cash sales first. But there will be a massive problem. Somebody leaks even our internal papers on this. This is a happy little group.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: When it happens, there will be a big noise from the Indians.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Are you buying from the French?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We are buying some missiles, but the French are holding back deliveries for two to four years. Unfortunately I was here when the agreement was signed. We want them now, not in two to four years. The French are slick businessmen, they keep pushing us back. Our negotiators quietly accepted their terms.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I know of no Pakistani who quietly accepts reverses. Someone asked me how many Pakistanis would be able to carry out the mediation in Cyprus. I said you would be able to do it, and you are welcome to take over. But I would advise you to stay out. I'd like to get out. The Greeks have a new formula for negotiations: riots, attack me in the press and then invite me in. I said I would wait two more weeks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: The Greeks invited Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> to mediate and then posed unacceptable conditions for a settlement. We bought three Breguet-Atlantique aircraft from the French. If we had had them in 1971, we could have destroyed the Indian OSA's which attacked Karachi in the middle of the night. The French gave us half-price on the aircraft - 38 million francs - but with the service and modifications the total price was 220 million francs. They are not only fleecing us, but also skinning us. The Croatale missiles increased from 200 to 350 million francs by the time we reached agreement. They know we have nowhere else to go and they exploit us.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d176-05" facs="d176-05"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How about Iran?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We don't know. They have offered to help us in the dieselization of our tanks.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Yes. We helped on that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We have suggested to the Iranians cross-training of our people on their equipment, but they are reluctant on that. We have had no training on their equipment.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Would you like me to raise that with the Shah?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: No. We don't want him to know that we complained. He has been very good to us.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Why not? I will see him alone on my trip. We have a very good relationship.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: If war, God forbid, should come, we only want equipment from Iran, not troops. The Shah talks in sweeping terms of support, but we don't know specifically what it would be.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Even against Afghanistan?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: Yes, against Afghanistan. The most we could hope for would be the transfer of equipment if we saw war coming.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Their Air Force could help.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We would only want their equipment but that requires training.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Let me talk to the Shah. What are you doing on the Cambodian Resolution?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: What is it?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: One resolution would expel the Cambodians. We want deferral of the issue for one year.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We will look into it, with your views in mind.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How is the Prime Minister?</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d176-06" facs="d176-06"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: Fine. He has been touring the northern areas. We picked up Hunza, but there is no change in our stand on Jammu and Kashmir. Hunza will be a directly administered area. We could not leave it with the Mir of Hunza. On another matter I want to bring up. In spite of the promises made by oil producers, we have not had much help. They say that balance of payments assistance is against their policy. The Saudis have provided $100 million in loans for four projects - $50 million now and the rest in two years. Our oil deficit is $200 million. We have $150 million in a loan from Iran and will get another $50 million from the Saudis. We are even on the deficit, but this increases our debt and we will have problems in years ahead. We are in difficulty on wheat and vegetable oil. We appreciate your problems.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Have any arrangements been made for wheat for Pakistan?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: We have made recommendation for the second quarter but no action has been taken as yet.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: The word is around that Pakistan is better off than India or Bangladesh and that Pakistan is not the most severely hit. Well, we are better off than India and Bangladesh, but not so well off as to get nothing. We have a difficult problem with wheat. We had hoped to be even this year, but because of bad weather and too optimistic forecasting, we find we have a deficit of 1.1 million tons.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We insist on a high priority for Pakistan in our internal discussions on food assistance. We have lots of problems with other departments, with Agriculture which wants a medium-sized allocation, and OMB which wants a low allocation. There is concern over the effect on our food prices. But I hope we will have a decision on the second quarter before you come down to see the President. We will be sympathetic. We will not be able to give you all you want, but we will be very sympathetic. We'll let you know.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We have imported 650,000 tons from our own resources.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: On food we can't do everything but we'll do something. I saw Mujib today for the first time. He keeps talking about “my oil, my people, my food”. He said he wants some assets from Pakistan.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d176-07" facs="d176-07"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: When Bhutto visited Dacca, Mujib said he wanted immediate agreement on 56 percent of Pakistan's ships and planes. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> told him he could not make an immediate decision, because he is accountable to his people in Parliament. <persName corresp="#p_HK2">KAMAL HOSSAIN</persName> talked to me later and forced me to say that when the liabilities and assets are counted, the balance may be against Bangladesh. I told him not to be too anxious for a full accounting.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Mujib said he will explain the whole situation to me. I have never been to Dacca before. He wants you to take 67,000 families of Biharis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: MUJIB's position is sheer cussedness and vindictiveness. I have been told by a diplomat in Bangladesh that it is extraordinary to see the jute mills running at half capacity, while outside the mills there are Biharis in camps. They won't employ them, even though they have the skills to run the mills.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Why don't you want them?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: We have debated this at length. The Sind already has a high proportion of non-Sindhis. There is a delicate political balance.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Who are the non-Sindhis?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: They are refugees from India. There was a massive move to Karachi at partition. We took 150,000 non-Bengalees and we tried to spread them around the country. But once they come, they drift to Karachi.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Because the employment is there?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: Yes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> says that he doesn't believe in provincialism, but he has to take it into account. He explained this to MUJIB. We have offered to set up a commission on assets that would report its conclusions within six months. On the Biharis, after good relations are established and there is some movement in our relations, maybe the problem can be resolved quietly. But Mujib said no.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I will see you in Washington and then later in Islamabad.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: The press may want to know after this meeting what you have discussed.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d176-08" facs="d176-08"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Say that we had very warm talks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: Can you say “in the context of our special relationship"?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Let us say that we had warm talks in the context of our very special friendship.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: That's fine.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We are very conscious of your needs on arms. On food we will try to move very fast.</p>

                        <p>The President: Thank you for the letter from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. How long have you been here now?</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Three weeks, two of which I was in the hospital.</p>

                        <p>[The press was ushered out.].</p>

                            </hi>: They say that death is nature's way of telling your husband to slow down.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The President</hi>: I am pleased to welcome you here and to assure you of my desire to continue the good relationship we have between us and Pakistan.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d177-02" facs="d177-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: We are proud of this relationship. It is our only guarantee of survival as an independent state. We thought that India would want to leave us alone after having reduced us in size. We don't think India's designs have changed, basically. What we didn't count on was the Soviet Union. The breaking-up of Pakistan whetted the Soviet appetite. The Soviet modus operandi is to have us join the Asian Collective Security pact. They are becoming more insistent all the time and they raise it incessantly.</p>
                        <p>India is five times as strong as us, but the Soviet Union continues to supply them with military equipment. The Indian budget is the highest ever.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: If we didn't know they were pacifists, we would be worried.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: We know that India is not planning to invade China, so they must be for us. Now they are arming Afghanistan. Our information — and the information the Chinese have — is that the Soviet Union had a hand in the <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> revolution. <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName> has now for the fist time come out with a territorial demand against Pakistan. Before they had only propagandized, inciting the tribes. Now they have publicly said they don't regard the North West Territory or Baluchistan as part of Pakistan. They have finally come out into the open — and only because of Soviet encouragement. Otherwise they wouldn't have done it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The President</hi>: What kind of capability do they have?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: They are no problem by themselves. But in concert with India and with the backing of the Soviet Union, they are dangerous.</p>
                        <p>So we are in a jam. There is a pincer against us — India with sophisticated weapons and a defense budget of $2 1/2 billion. We ask them why do they need it? Who is it against? India's Foreign Minister said we would have to discuss that. I told him their actions don't match their profession. The Soviet Union has its eye on the Persian Gulf — Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Of these, Iraq, Afghanistan and India are in the Soviet pocket. Only Pakistan stands in their way. Also we are friendly with the PRC, which they don't like, and also with you.</p>
                        <p>We think the Soviet Union doesn't want the disintegration of Pakistan but only to bend our will to their policies. Over the past years I have had the honor to meet your predecessor two times and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> four times. <pb n="3" xml:id="d177-03" facs="d177-03"/>Your government has been sympathetic. But I think you don't think the threat is as great as we do - but we are on the firing line. It also has been tempting to think that political action would take care of the problem. Your predecessor, I believe, spoke to the Kremlin leaders about this. It doesn't seem to have been effective. In 1948 and 1949 you agreed to give us equipment. That was cut off in 1964-65, and there has been nothing since we cut if off.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The President</hi>: There has been some aid.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: On a descending scale.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The President</hi>: Congress has had almost a 180-degree change of heart on aid — the first vote I cast was $7 billion for the Marshall Plan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: That served Europe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The President</hi>: So I am as concerned as others that Congress doesn't seem to see the importance of these tools for us. We struggle to get what we have. It is very disturbing to me.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: We find it so to our cost. For nine years we have been shut off. We can't even buy it from another country. The Chinese have been good to us but they have no sophisticated weapons, and tanks are no good without missiles. We are at the mercy of India militarily, and also of Afghanistan if it is supported by the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The next war can come easily whenever the Soviet Union, India and Afghanistan want it — and we would be wiped out. The next time Afghanistan won't stay neutral.</p>
                        <p>We bought some things from France, but they fleeced us — they skinned us.</p>
                        <p>We are getting weaker and weaker and in greater and greater peril. Your predecessor and the Secretary of State said, “Be patient, wait for our elections, don't embarrass us,” and on and on. We have been patient, but the Prime Minister wanted me to tell you we are desperate.</p>
                        <p>I told our Parliament that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said the independence and integrity of Pakistan are a cornerstone of United States policy. The opposition <pb n="4" xml:id="d177-04" facs="d177-04"/>said, “Tell us another one.” No one believes in the reliability of the United States. We leave what we can do to your judgment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The President</hi>: I am personally very sympathetic. I don't want to reiterate a story you have already heard, but we do have a problem. To get the boost in economic aid, we have to take a beating on military aid. We took a terrible beating on the restrictive amendments on the aid bill. Our question is how best to distribute it when the pile is smaller. And the elections may make Congress even more against aid. We will do the best we can. We will review the military grant and sales. We will do what we can in economic aid. We have given 100,000 tons of wheat. When the crops are in, we will see what more we can do. We stopped a Soviet grain sale which would have made things even more difficult. We will do the best we can.</p>

                            </hi>: There is distinction to be made on military assistance. On grants there is no hope, but we will try to permit cash military sales. We did, however, help in 1971. We are exploring a change which would permit third country sales. We will pursue that in the new Congress.</p>
                        <p>I will be prepared to make a public statement about the independence and territorial integrity of Pakistan. I would be glad to do that, and it would be even more useful if I do it in Pakistan.</p>

It was a great surprise and a blow to us. We need a minimum of 100,000 tons of oil. We thought we would earn $1.5 billion on exports. But the cotton market has crashed and we earn only $1 billion now. So, subtract $300 million for oil and there isn't much left. We have already bought 650,000 tons of wheat and 60,000 (?) tons of oil. The 100,000 of oil will cost us about $150 million, out of about $300 million left.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked that I pass the following report to you of his initial discussions in India:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I met this morning in the royal splendor of the former British Viceroy's palace in New Delhi with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> in private and with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> for a brief word in private and then with his senior aides. My talks were frank but very warm. It is evident that they are very pleased by the visit and our recognition of India as an important country in the world and the predominant power in the sub-continent. Despite Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s almost pathological need to criticize the United States, she, too, desires to see relations between us improve on this new and more equal basis. She and her minister very much want you to visit India next year. As you approved, we will announce your acceptance of her invitation in the joint statement at the end of my Delhi visit. In addition, the Foreign Minister wants to visit Washington, symbolizing our better relationship, and we will also announce this for early next year.</p>
                                <p>“The Indian leaders are aware of our concerns over their nuclear policy which I raised privately with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, in order not to embarrass them before others on a very sensitive subject. With Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> I said very frankly that their nuclear explosion was a bomb no matter how India described it; that her undertaking not to produce nuclear weapons did not mean the next government would not do so; and that we were not interested in recriminations but in how to prevent further proliferation. By our second meeting, she seemed to have reflected on this and asked if we had any specific proposals. I have asked <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> to follow up this possible opening with her. The Foreign Minister has reaffirmed that India will not develop nuclear weapons, and this point will be included in the joint statement. In addition, at the Foreign Minister's request, I stated in my speech tonight that we take this pledge seriously, which makes their commitment even more binding.</p>
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d179-02" facs="d179-02"/>
                                <p>“They are eager to see our new relationship transformed into specific, material forms of cooperation, and welcomed the formal establishment this afternoon of a US-India Joint Commission. We set up three sub-commissions to develop concrete programs in the fields of economy and commerce, science and technology, and education and culture. With the subcommissions and the new trade bill our troublesome economic relations with India ought to improve. While clearly welcoming what economic and food assistance we can provide and disappointed that we cannot make more available under PL 480, they remain sensitive about letting what the Foreign Minister called an “aid complex” dominate our relationship and did not press me on this subject.</p>
                                <p>“Their preoccupation with our never providing lethal weapons to Pakistan is obsessive. I tried to reassure them and place the matter in perspective by stating that we will not become part of an arms race in the sub-continent and will never engage in any action which would threaten India's superior military relationship with the other countries of the sub-continent. In private with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, I made the point that at most what would be involved would be limited cash sales to Pakistan and that she should reflect on the risk that, if frustrated on conventional arms purchases, Pakistan would be under even greater pressure to go nuclear. In brief, I kept our options open on possible future changes in our South Asian arms supply policy, which I expect Bhutto to press very hard. I hope that the dialogue I began today will make this issue a less overshadowing one in India's perception of our relationship. I also reminded them that Pakistan and Iran have been anxious about India's attitude toward Pakistani minority tribes.</p>
                                <p>“They asked us to assure Pakistan of their concern for its independence and territorial integrity. I assured them our relations with Russia and China do not in any way impinge upon India's interests but I warned them of the long-term danger of the so-called non-aligned appearing to seek a confrontation with the developing countries at a time when the latter are experiencing difficulties and less able to ignore provocation.</p>
                                <p>“Tomorrow I will continue with talks in India, and travel on to Bangladesh Wednesday.”</p>

                            </hi>: There is a lot of talk about a “Pentagon” here too. But it's more disciplined.</p>

                            </hi>: The Pentagon is more disciplined than the State Department. Or will be when I get through with it.</p>

                            </hi>: Unless I last long enough. Our Foreign Service all think they should be Secretary of State, and if I don't do what they tell me, they go to the favorable newspapers and complain.</p>

                        <p>I am still getting used to being in my new job and im still thinking Like my old job. But they say external affairs and defense are really two sides of the same coin.</p>
                        <p>May I, Mr. Secretary, first of all express my pleasure to welcome you here. When we had contacts before, I used an my efforts to have you come here.</p>

                            </hi>: I see your visit has gone well. I'm glad to say it will have a lingering effect and impact. You have brought a breath of fresh air. You have introduced new elements, in your inimitable manner. The effect will last.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: I hope that will be true, because that was the purpose of my visit. I will follow it up in Washington. And your Foreign Minister is coming to Washington. Now these contacts are established.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: They have to flog both sides. I am glad Tikki Kaul is doing so well.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I had something to do with his appointment here, and it was one of the best decisions President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> made.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: And his decision to accept.</p>

                            </hi>: I can say now that when I became Secretary of State I tried to get him to come back to Washington. He resisted. It was the right decision.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: I read your speech. You gave an excellent expression to the possibilities and also to the limitations.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: I tried to.</p>

                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: My recollection is — I'm trying to forget my Foreign Office mucking-up — that this is the first Secretary of State to recognize nonalignment. We feel flattered you chose Delhi for saying that. We genuinely believe in nonalignment. It's not neutrality. We are not neutral between justice and injustice. Irrespective of who gets offended at what we say, we have to say what we feel. So I am glad the concept of nonalignment is no longer unacceptable in the State Department.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: No.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: It's a philosophy of nonalignment, not a slogan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: As I said, it would be a concern if it became an alignment like a bloc, with the same rigidity.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: No, we wouldn't become part of such a bloc.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: NEHRU said, “the nonaligned are also nonaligned inter se.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: We greatly value your support for the process of bilateralism and the Simla spirit. I am a modest man but I can't help taking credit for India, that compared to other areas of tension, we have achieved something in resolving tensions. We can understand your saying all the countries contributed, but in the situation as it was thrown up after the war, all the give was on our side. Because we had their territory and their prisoners. It was a sensation in the international community. We did it not as a favor to Pakistan but because we thought it was a good thing. We never gave the Pakistanis a sense of being a defeated country. It had a psychological impact in Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>We have dealt with their military regimes — Ayub, Yahya — and democratic regimes. We are glad to see democracy emerge. We see even ZULFIKAR ALI BHUTTO not hesitating to use a big stick.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: Internally?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes, but we have educated our people and our press. We've taken care not to react unduly. For example, his actions on Pushtunistan, Punjab and Sind. We know that because the democratic system was restored after some time, we can't expect him to act with the full balance of the democratic system.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: The Secretary of State made a crucial contribution at a critical moment on the exchange of prisoners and Bengalis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes, we exchanged some messages.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: But we have the feeling that once he got a short-term advantage — getting the territory and prisoners — he's reverted to his policy of confrontation. He even wrote a book on it — which we will give you. The concept was that for Pakistan to remain viable and have a valid entity for its people, a policy of confrontation was essential. At Simla he said, “I used to be a believer in confrontation, but after the wars, I see it helps you more.” We took him at his word, but he reverts to it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: He told me he would recognize Bangladesh but first he had to go through a phase of confrontation with India internally. But then he would recognize Bangladesh, which he did.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: But you should never encourage him in such a policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: After Simla he said he would do it in two weeks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: Well, broken promises aren't something we pay much attention to because we're used to expecting it from him. Minor things are not a problem. When it comes to hard things — that you recognize India as the major power in the region… And I also noticed you said any great country has to have a sense of responsibility — we accept that. But you should study our attitude over the past five years, and the future, and I want to assure you. we will be responsible. I don't want to dilate long on this.</p>
                        <p>On the north, there are two kingdoms, Nepal and Bhutan. On the east, Burma and the Communist system. We have a democracy. To the west, Pakistan. It's a diverse region. But we have never, I repeat, never, tried to impose our concept on others. I recall two instances. When Sri Lanka was in danger of a Communist takeover, in 24 hours we gave her all the assistance she required, and two naval ships started patrolling in 12 hours.</p>

                        <p>Our general approach in the region is to have an understanding on the basis of mutual understanding and sovereign equality. Look at our approach to relations with Iran, and with Afghanistan; I sent a message to you from there. And similarly on the eastern side. Our objective is not hegemonistic. When the Chinese say this, we would like you to know of our policy. Perhaps a big country has a disadvantage in dealing with its neighbors; it has not only not to do anything, but to give the impression it's not doing anything. We would like you to ponder over this.</p>

So any attempt to introduce arms in Pakistan will certainly wipe out our efforts. Perhaps sitting in an air-condined room and calculating 500 tanks and planes, it looks all right.

But I owe it to ourselves. I read somewhere that you were making comparisons.

                            </hi>: I want to explain our bureaucratic situation. It's a mistake, frankly, to escalate it to high-level consideration. I've tried to keep it at a low level.</p>

                            </hi>: But it is in your interest to keep it at a low level in our government. Because the low level can't do anything. I keep reading in the newspapers that there is a review. You can look at it two ways: review is a way of doing nothing. If we were seriously giving arms to Pakistan, I wouldn't give it to the South Asia desk, which is against it and will certainly leak it.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked that I pass you the following report of his meetings in India:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I spent this morning in talks with the three Indian Cabinet Ministers who, with the Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>, and the Prime Minister, form the ‘inner cabinet’of the Indian Government. These are men of great political durability — one, the Minister of Agriculture, who is a leader of the ‘untouchables’has been in every Cabinet since 1946 save for three years in the 1960's. They are moderate men, and, decently disposed to the United States. Certainly more so than the Prime Minister. As much as India can be said to work, it is men such as these who make it do so. Each has a new post, the Prime Minister having shifted them all around three weeks ago. C. Subramaniam is Minister of Finance. He is one of the ‘technocrats’ in the Cabinet and has long had close relations with us. He began by welcoming the ‘reinstatement of old relations’ between the US and India, noting that he had been the main beneficiary of those relations. (He was Minister of Food and Agriculture in the drought years 1966, when the US shipped India 8 million tons of wheat, and 1967, when 6 million tons were provided.) He said we need assistance again. India had bought or was buying $620 million worth of American wheat, and $1 billion of fertilizer, much of it from the United States, but that resources were being exhausted. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> said they hoped for 3 million tons from us.</p>
                                <p>“I said we had not restored an old relationship, but had begun a new and innovative one. I could not be optimistic about anything so large in the way of PL 480 food shipments. If we were to ship that much and price rises followed, Congress might abolish the whole program. The United States, I said, had to put its agricultural exports on a much more systematic basis, and we hoped to do so in the aftermath of the Rome Conference. We hoped India would benefit from this change.</p>
                                <p>“We talked of debt rescheduling, to which I said we were sympathetic, Subramaniam having reported that India will have a $700 million trade imbalance with the United States this year. He talked of his ideas for the World Food Conference, with emphasis on the need for a greater commitment of scientific resources to agricultural questions, and, of particular interest to me, of post-harvest technology. The United States loses about 7 percent of its crop <pb n="2" xml:id="d181-02" facs="d181-02"/>to spoilage and pests; India as much as 15 percent. We agreed this is a matter our new Joint Commission should take up.</p>
                                <p>“Jagjivan Ray, is Food Minister now, and was Food Minister once before in the late 1960's. Until just now he has been Defense Minister. He seems a quiet untouchable, but he plainly enough won the third Indo-Pakistan War. He began by saying, as Subramaniam had said, that India needs American assistance. The amount we have so far offered, 300,000 tons for the first half of 1975, would not be enough. I explained that we wanted to increase this amount, that we will try to move it toward 1 million tons, but that to do so we would have to take food away from other countries, and that I would have to get back to Washington before this could be done. I, however, said we would definitely increase our food aid, and that he would hear from us about two weeks after my return.</p>
                                <p>“We talked of India's long run agricultural prospects. If they can get themselves together out here, and get irrigation going, Northern India could become a giant imperial valley.</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName>, now Defense Minister, formerly Defense Minister, and in between, Foreign Minister, is an old friend. We had a long, thoroughly frank and genuinely useful exchange. Referring to the passage in my address yesterday in which I said ‘the United States accepts nonalignment,’ he said this was the first such statement ever by an American official. It was immensely important, and immensely flattering to India that it should have been said in New Delhi. He hoped it could be followed by serious talks about the principle of nonalignment: ‘It is not neutrality. We are not neutral where injustice occurs.’ I agreed, adding that the danger now seemed to lie in the emergence of what in effect is a bloc of nonaligned. Swaran Singh got the point clearly, saying ‘we would never be a member of such a group.'</p>
                                <p>“We talked then on regional relations, the Simla process, and the never-failing subject of arms to Pakistan. I said that we do not and could not regard Pakistan as being in the same category of power as India; that we would never support an arms race here; that we did not think of South Asia in balance-of-power terms. He spoke of the great harm that would be done to our relations if the United States resumed arms shipments, and of his concern that Pakistan might be thinking of a confrontation with India that would bring China into armed conflict as well.</p>
                                <p>“We had absolutely no interest in military confrontation between India and Pakistan. For historic reasons we could not be indifferent to the independence of Pakistan, but we do not look at Pakistan as a counterbalance to India. That issue, I said, has been settled. On the other hand we had to consider cash <pb n="3" xml:id="d181-03" facs="d181-03"/>sales of arms to Pakistan. Nothing was imminent. Conceivably we would respond. But, I assured him, if the matter ever reaches the point of being by the President, I would inform the Indian Ambassador. In any event I saw no such prospect for the immediate future. I said he had my absolute assurance that there would be no secret, clandestine arms shipments to Pakistan.</p>
                                <p>“I had said that frankly the arms-to-Pakistan issue was a problem for us with China which on every visit pleads with us in such matters. He spoke of his concern about Chinese intentions; they now have 150,000 troops on the Indian border. I said that if China were to attack India they would find us on the other side. I said we have absolutely no interest to let China weaken India. Our relations with China were a marriage of convenience: H should read what they say about us in their <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speeches.</p>
                                <p>“In sum, we have had a successful visit; as much as we would have wanted. A Russian reading the Indian press today might wonder what they had to show for their efforts of the past four years and more.</p>
                                <p>“Half of the front page of both the English language and the vernacular press is devoted to headlines, photographs, cartoons, and stories of the visit. Most of the editorial pages are given over to the same subject, as they have been for a week now. One would not know there was a country called Russia. A Chinese might have to consider that the Americans can operate in the Third World as well as they. If there is a problem, it will be in keeping the Indians from exaggerating the success. This Prime Minister is not likely to do this; her suspicions of the United States are pathological. But the Cabinet might and the public might. India is in desperate economic condition, and the only prospect is for things to grow worse. But the American capacity to make any very great difference is drastically limited now, as it was not, or at least was not thought to be, in the 1960's.</p>
                                <p>“They would consider a visit from you a great event, and know that you have been invited. You may well want to consider coming.”</p>

                        <p>1. BEGIN SUMMARY. SECRETARY MET WITH INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> IN TWO-HOUR SESSION MORNING OCTOBER 28. ATMOSPHERE FRANK BUT VERY CORDIAL. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> SAW MUCH OF PAST US-INDIAN PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM US RELUCTANCE RECOGNIZE INDIA'S ROEL IN SOUTH ASIA AND EFFORTS TO BALANCE PAKISTAN AGAINST INDIA. THOUGH 1971 HAD CAUSED BASIC CHANGE, AND OUTLOOK NOW MUCH IMPROVED. SECRETARY DESCRIBED PROBLEMS IN PAST FLOWING FROM WHAT PROVED TO BE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF INDIAN STANCE IN INTERNATIONAL ISSUES AFFECTING US INTERESTS. US RECOGNIZED INDIA AS A MAJOR POWER IN WORLD AND IN SOUTH ASIA. SAID THAT WHILE THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF BALANCING PAKISTAN AGAINST INDIA, US WOULD CONTINUE TRADITIONALLY CLOSE TIES WITH PAKISTAN AND HIGHLY INTERESTED IN UNITY, INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF PAKISTAN. EMPHASIZED STRONG SUPPORT FOR SIMLA</p>

                        <p>PROCESS. POLICIES TOWARD SOVIETS AND CHINESE ALSO</p>
                        <p>DISCUSSED. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> BEGAN ATTH LONG OPENING STATEMENT IN WHICH HE REVIEWED AT LENGTH INDO-US RELATIONS. SAID HIS PURPOSE WAS NOT TO HIGHLIGHT PAST DIFFICULTIES AS SUCH BUT TO TRY TO FOCUS ON WHY SOME OF THESE AROSE. HE THOUGHT THERE HAD BEEN A CERTAIN HESITANCY IN RECOGNIZING INDIA'S POSITION IN SUBCONTINENT, PARTICULARLY IN WHAT INDIA SAW AS EFFORTS IN THE PAST TO SEE THAT SOME KIND OF MILITARY PARITY BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN. THE EVENTS OF 1971 HAD RESULTED IN BASIC CHANGE IN THIS SITUATION AND A RECOGNITION OF NEW REALITIES AND INDIA WANTED THIS TO CONTINUE.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> THEN REVIEWED EVOLUTION IN INDIA'S RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS, NOTING CONSISTENT POLICY SINCE 1971 TO FOSTER SIMLA PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY TODAY, ONE HEARD RENEWED TALK OF OLD QUESTION OF MILITARY PARTIY. IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT ANY FORM OF SUPPLY OF LETHAL WEAPONS TO PAKISTAN WOULD CREATE THE SAME PROBLEMS AS BEFORE. REGARDING SOVIETS, CHAVAN EMPHASIZED TRADITIONALLY CLOSE RELATIONS; 1971 TREATY NOT DIRECTED AGAINST ANY OTHER COUNTRIES. CHINESE POLICY UNFORTUNATELY REMAINED DIFFICULT, NOTING EVIDENCE OF SUBVERSIVE EFFORTS AMONG MIZOS AND NAGAS AND MORE RECENTLY CHINA'S “OUTBURSTS" REGARDING SIKKIM. INDIA WELCOMED US DETENTE WITH CHINA BUT HOPED INDIAN POSITION WOULD BE KEPT IN MIND AND THAT US MIGHT BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE CHINESE POLICY TOWARD SOUTH ASIA.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> COMPLETED REVIEW BY EMPHASIZING INDIAN INTEREST IN PEACE AND STABILITY AND GOOD RELATIONS WITH ALL NEIGHBORS AND SAID THAT ONCE THIS APPROACH WAS UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR US AND INDIA TO WORK TOGETHER IN THIS REGION, AS WELL AS IN LARGER AREA OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC ISSUES.</p>
                        <p>5. SECRETARY RESPONDED BY REVIEWING DIFFICULTIES IN PAST US-INDIAN RELATIONS, MUCH OF WHICH HE SAW GROWING OUT OF EXCESSIVELY HIGH EXPECTATION ON PART OF MANY</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

                        <p>AMERICANS WITH SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS TOWARDS INDIA IN EARLIER YEARS THAT INDIA WOULD ACT AS A SORT OF MORAL CONSCIENCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. CONSEQUENTLY MANY AMERICANS HAD EXPECTED MORE OF INDIA THAN PERHAPS OF OTHERS AND WHEN INDIA DID NOT ACT AS AMERICANS HAD HOPED, THERE WAS UNNECESSARY DISAPPOINTMENT. AAORTUNATELY WE NOW HAVE NEW SITUATION AND IMPORVEMENT IN RELATIONS. BY MODERATING OUR CLAIMS ON EACH OTHER WE CAN HAVE A MORE REALISTIC RELATIONSHIP. US RECOGNIZED INDIA AS A MAJOR WORLD POWER AND AS THE DOMINANT POWER IN SOUTH ASIA. US HAD NO INTEREST IN ACTIONS DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE BALANCE OF POWER IN SUBCONTINENT IN TERMS OF MILITARY EQUALITY.</p>
                        <p>6. SECRETARY EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR SIMLA PROCESS. NOTED PARALLEL INTERST OF US AND INDIA IN STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF BANGLADESH AND SAID US WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO COORDINATING AID POLICIES THERE WITH INDIA.</p>
                        <p>7. ON PAKISTAN SECRETARY RECALLED CLOSE AND HISTORIC TIES WITH THAT COUNTRY WHICH WOULD NOT BE ALTERED BY THE FACT OF OUR RECOGNIZING SUPERIOR STRENGTH OF INDIA. US WOULD NOT ENGAGE IN ARMS BUILD UP IN PAKISTAN DESIGNED TO CHANGE BALANCE OF POWER.</p>
                        <p>8. SECRETARY STRESSED US DESIRE FOR GOOD RELATIONS WITH CHINA. EVOLUTION OF US POLICY TOWARD CHINA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH INDIA, AND US WOULD OPPOSE ANY ACTIONS ON PART OF CHINESE TO EXTEND INFLUENCE IN SOUTH ASIA IN WAYS THAT WOULD CONTRICUTE TO INSTABILITY. TO EXTENT US HAD INFLUENCE TO DO SO, IT WOULD USE IT TO ENCOURAGE BETTERN INDO-CHINESE RELATIONS.</p>
                        <p>9. WITH THE SOVIETS, US REMAINED ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TOWARD DETENTE. US HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH CLOSE INDIAN-SOVIET RELATIONS SO LONG AS INDIAN POLICY NOT SO COORDINATED WITH THAT OF THE SOVIETS AS TO LINE UP WITH THEM ON EVERY ISSUE. THAT DID NOT SEEM TO US TO BE THE CASE NOW.</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

                        <p>10. SECRETARY SUMMARIZED BY REAFFIRMING US INTEREST IN SOUTH ASIAN PEACE AND STABILITY AND END TO ALL OUTSIDE INTERVENTION. US POLICY TOWARD INDIA WOULD BE BASED ON OUR INTERESTS AS WE SEE THEM AND NOT IN TERMS OF DOING FAVORS. US ASSUMED INDIA WOULD DO LIKEWISE IN ITS APPROACH TO US, AND IF THIS WERE THE CASE, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH ISSUES SUCH AS AID DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE COULD BE TALKED ABOUT ON REALISTIC BASIS.</p>
                        <p>1. SECRETARY EXPRESSED ENDORSEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF INDIAN NON-ALIGNMENT BUT EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER CURRENT EVOLUTION ON INTERNATIONAL SCENE OF A NEW AND DISTURBING PATTERN OF ALIGNMENT AMONG THE NON-ALIGNED, DIRECTED AGAINST THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND AFTEN MORE RIGID THAN EARLIER ALIGNMENTS. THOUGHT INDIA COULD BE HELPFUL IN MODERATING THIS TREND.</p>
                        <p>12. DURING MEETING <persName corresp="#p_SK2">KEWAL SIGH</persName> TOOK OPPORTUNITY REVIEW HIS RECENT TALKS IN ISLAMABAD. WHILE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> APPRECIATIVE OF PROGRESS MADE, HE REGRETTED THAT PROGRESS STILL RATHER HALTING; INDIA WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT PICK UP SPEED. HIS TALKS WITH BHUTTO CAUSED HIM TO CONCLUDE THAT WAY STILL NOT CLEAR FOR SMOOTH AND STEADY RELATIONS. EXPRESSED HOPE SECRETARY COULD ENCOURAGE A MORE FORTH-COMING PAKISTANI ATTITUDE. SECRETARY SAID HE WOULD DISCUSS SOUTH ASIA MATTERS WITH <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>, AND <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> COULD BE CERTAIN THAT US WOULD USE ITS INFLUENCE IN SUPPORT OF SIMLA PROCESS.</p>

                            </hi>: Did you get some rest?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Not much. I have been working on my World Food Conference Speech. I am learning a lot about agriculture. I am trying to say something at Rome despite the united opposition of the bureaucracy in Washington. For once the problem is not my favorite whipping boy, the Foreign Service, but the people in agriculture. They are accustomed to selling on a free market when there is a surplus whereas there is now a need to allocate resources. This is a new conception and they are not geared to it.</p>

                            </hi>: I remember we had a team of American advisors on our development program in the early 1960s, from Harvard I think. They advised us not to become self-sufficient in wheat but to industrialize instead because there would always be a U.S. surplus.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: I was told of two problems when I first came into the government. One was whether to use U.S. oil at $2.75 a barrel or to use Arab oil at $2.25 a barrel. I was told that the thing to do was to use Arab oil so our oil would stay at the same price. Then there was the proposition of the SHAH to guarantee us a 25-year supply of all of Iran's oil production at a fixed price of about $4 a barrel. The experts rejected this on the grounds it would be seen as a plot against Libya. If we had made that deal we would not have trouble today.</p>

                            </hi>: She is at Murree. The last time a <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> went to a Pakistan hill station, he ended up in China.</p>

                            </hi>: I hope Nancy comes back. The last time you were here you were so fatigued. Your eyes were leaden. I thought it would be cruel to talk to you about our small problems.</p>

But we have a protocol problem among ourselves. <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> is a former bureaucrat and very conscious of protocol while I am formally the Foreign Minister. I am also the Minister of Defense since one has to maintain tight control in order to avoid a coup.</p>

                            </hi>: We have no problems between our countries. We are your friend and your ally. We would like to have your views on our area of the world, which includes a little of the Middle East such as Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia. We have good relations with the other Arabs, too, including Syria and Algeria, with whom we have an excellent rapport.</p>

                            </hi>: I tried to get the Russians to let me see you. I referred to this often in my talks with them but they never took the hint. You have to hit them over the head with a mallet to get them to understand. I even told the Soviets that the Chinese had arranged for me to meet you when we were in Peking at the same time. This usually makes them do the same thing in order to keep up.</p>

                            </hi>: I understand a problem has been raised about this. But we do not see the present phrase at all as endorsing the hegemony of India. Rather we see it as a lever against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. To be quite frank, I never thought about the special Indian interpretation until Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> talked to me this morning. But in any event, you can be sure we will not he influenced at all by what the Indians say the phrase means but by our own perception of the situation. Our interpretation is that we are free to help you in an emergency. You will soon see President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and he will tell you himself that is still our position. Those are the judgments that will matter and not some dependent clause in a communique. What counts is our perception. Maybe I did not analyze this enough but it never occurred to me that you could be upset.</p>

                            </hi>: I don't argue over small things like a few words of a communique. It is our talks that count. But someone in the Foreign Office saw it as a sort of a Monroe Doctrine.</p>

                            </hi>: I never thought of that interpretation until you had it called to my attention. It is not a frivolous comment. But our interpretation should be seen in light of our attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its role in the Sub-Continent.</p>

                            </hi>: Can you agree to our proposed wording for the communique here about no expansionism or hegemony? It is taken directly from the Shanghai Communique.</p>

                            </hi>: Let's forget about it, then. But don't you come from New Delhi thinking that India is really expansionist?</p>

                            </hi>: After seeing India, I am thinking about supplying nuclear weapons, not only conventional arms, to Pakistan and even Bangladesh! There seems to me a difference between what they say and what they mean. In every meeting I had in Delhi I put on the record that the independence of integrity of Pakistan was a fundamental principle of American foreign policy. They know it. I called attention to your concerns about Afghanistan and Baluchistan. They swore they were exercising a moderating influence. They said it so strongly that I would be in a good position to go back to them. If you can get evidence that I can produce, I would make a case with them. They asked me to tell you they have no harmful intentions toward you. But their real perception is probably different. They may have a hegemonial tendency in the Sub-Continent. The Monroe Doctrine idea may not be so far off. But everything they said was in the other sense. I repeatedly told them of our support for you and they never commented or objected, thereby indicating acquiescence. But my perception is that we are dealing with a rather single-minded political approach which sees the Sub-Continent as eventually coming under their influence. This affects their entire attitude, including toward Nepal, etc.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, and even Afghanistan. NEHRU talked about India extending from the Ganges to the Himalayas.</p>

                            </hi>: I always say that the rest of the world can be fortunate they are pacifists! I remember Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> talking to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. She said little on Bangladesh but spent a lot of time on Baluchistan and Pushtunistan and of how her father had been accused of abandoning these areas.</p>

                            </hi>: They have a perverse interpretation of history. The fact that they demand to be recognied as a major power shows they really are not one. No truly great power makes such a demand. They do not really have such a position.</p>

                            </hi>: Their thinking is extremely convoluted. Look at Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s interview the day before I arrived. She is hard to deal with but Simla is nevertheless a useful contribution. I am accused by her of two things; not taking seriously India's position on the subcontinent and excluding India from our global strategy. Both can't be true.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: She can't have it both ways. she is a difficult person to deal with. But she can be a nice person too. And she did a good thing at Simla.</p>
                        <p>Some of my advisers say that India has such economic problems she will not be free to cause trouble. But this is precisely what worries us. In India's history, it is always trying to thrust out. Sikkim and Bangladesh are two points in evidence. She took on Bangladesh and burned her fingers. One would have thought once bitten, twice shy. But no! Despite their problems they constitute a menace.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: I agree, and Bhutan. The whole historic process is the problem. The daughter does not depart from her father's books. Pakistan is the barrier to India's territorial ambitions. If it were not for that, we would not be concerned. It is not that we want toys to play with. We would like to be able to strip our army of its power and put it in its place. But we must protect our borders. If we are stronger, it will enable us to do more in negotiating. But the Indians are so stupid and arrogant they can not negotiate. They are getting so uppity!</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d183-06" facs="d183-06"/>
                        <p>It requires a great deal of mental discipline to pursue with negotiations. I don't mind her so much. But her entourage! They're the cat's whiskers! When they came here the last time, I spoke to Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SK2">Singh</persName> about Sikkim, telling him that the whole world wants normal relations with us and vice versa. We try our best to normalize relations with India and then you explode an atomic device. He told us not to take any cognizance of it, not to worry, that it did not represent a militarist policy and that negotiations would resume within three months. But I told him they gobbled up Sikkim in the process.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Why did they do it? Didn't they already control the foreign policy of Sikkim?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: They continue to get more arrogant. It's outside the scope of logic. They lie. It is the history of the SubContinent. The British gave representation to parts of states. Ceylon was also such a fragment. The Indians say their nuclear device is a PNE but no one believes it that. It was a bomb.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Kisssinger</hi>: We have said publicly that we take seriously their assurances in order to recall to them their responsibilities. But I told all Indian officials to whom I spoke that they had a bomb and not to be so naive as to pretend otherwise. It is useful to take their assurances seriously since it strengthens the assurances. It makes it more difficult for them to call attention to their nuclear capability in a crisis. But I have no illusions and I said so even to a group of Indian intellectuals.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Who knows the intentions of the Devil! In a secret meeting of the Congress Party leaders the Indian Minister of State for Defense said they were planning the disintegration of Pakistan. We have evidence through the Swiss. We are going to lodge a strong protest. We have so many people here whom they take to London and then to Delhi, I try to subvert them. Being a political leader, I don't shoot them. I try to establish contact with them in London. They are professional agitators. One was a classmate of mine in school; later Governor of Baluchistan.</p>

                            </hi>: We have serious cause to be concerned. If Pakistan's existence is not important to the US, then say so. But I'd like to respectfully submit that it does concern the US. With our ties with Iran, China, and the Gulf, we can be useful to you. But. you cannot say that our relations have gone up and down, they have gone only up and further up. The only time it didn't was when you had your illogical policy on China. Our own survival is so important that we could not support your China policy during the <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> period. But how do you tell a Great Power that its policy is illogical? I told <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> frankly that our relations with China were such that we could not accommodate the us. The only set-back to our relations was then, but it was a result of your global misunderstandings. Where, since 1947, has it been Pakistan that has been responsible for any downturns? I wanted to leave everything aside and not take up our problems in front of you. We respect our relations with you. We can not play the game of putting an a sad face for your benefit like India. I hope your relations with India have matured but your Ambassador to New Delhi seems to be taken in by all that baloney.</p>

                            </hi>: Not <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>. Absolutely not. I think he has a rather mature view of the situation. He said that he would resign if we sent you arms but when we shipped them he did not resign. We had reached agreement earlier for an over-time shipment but they actually arrived after he got to New Delhi; yet he stayed on. That sort of thing can not influence our policy. Pakistan is too important. If India were permitted to swallow Pakistan that would have profound implications, with China especially and throughout the sub-Continent. It would set a precedent we would be bound to resist. Seventy million people can not be swallowed up and made to disappear.</p>

                            </hi>: But we would like to be able to resist it. Then we wouldn't have to put you in a difficult position. We need sufficient arms for our defense. We have no grandiose ideas. We don't want the quantities the Soviets give India. If we bad that we could be on top of the world, but we do not want it. All we want is enough for our needs.</p>

                            </hi>: I have always found him all there, also. There are few Chiefs of State who can conduct a conversation as he does. I now think Mao spent so much time with me during my last visit in order to support what Chou had been telling me. The basic Chinese bible is “as Mao said” so his personal intervention will cement my exchanges with Chou. But I have no feel for what will happen after they disappear.</p>

We do have a mutual interest in preventing a nuclear conflict but we also have regional, ideological competition. The Chinese tell me the Soviet threat is to everyone but China. I tell them the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is closer to China than the US and more of a threat to them.

                            </hi>: Faisal is trying to bring about the end of his own monarchy by bringing in foreign resources and exports and techniques, which will speed up radicalization at home, and at the same time weakening the countries abroad on whom he must depend for support. He is also making Saudi Arabia more attractive for its covetous neighbors. I am saying this to you, a friend of Faisal, just as I am. But when he tells me of the modernizing he is encouraging, I think “Oh, you fool.”</p>

                            </hi>: I am not surprised by the recognition received by the PLO at Rabat but I can not tell who did what to whom. I can not figure out how they see the next phase of negotiations taking place. <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">Sadat</persName> on the one hand says they don't need Geneva. On the other hand, there is Rabat and the Egyptian endorsement of the PLO. I really like the Arabs. Their personalities count for so much. Those I like the best are Asad and Boumediene, who cause me so much trouble. But I can not be sure where reality ends with the Arabs and where epic poetry begins. I can't tell if Rabat was epic poetry or insanity. If they try to settle all the issues simultaneously Israel will give an evasive reply and stall and we will be in a 1967-73 situation all over again. The US can never bring off a settlement of all the issues at once. Israel can not win the war with history but over the next three years the Arabs can not win, so neither side has a real option for war. Only the US can produce peace. But we need the cooperation of Asad and the crazy Israelis have put settlements right up to the line and will give him nothing. If we could get 10 kilometers for Asad this year, we would not hear from him again. He is a likeable, honorable man even if he is tough. <pb n="12" xml:id="d183-12" facs="d183-12"/>

                            </hi>: So you did. The fact is that there must be a stop to this all-or-nothing approach or the Arabs will drive themselves into hostility to the US and Israel will have won this round. There will be a war of terrible consequences and Israel will turn it into a US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> confrontation. The Arabs will play the Israeli game. Right now I am being attacked at home because of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and because Israel wants to weaken me and to undermine a step by step approach - not to get rid of me yet but to fix it so my advice will no longer prevail. No U.S. administration can impose a total solution on Israel. I will go to the Middle East to see Asad and Faisal and <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">Sadat</persName> and Hussein after Rome, to try and find out what happened. The Arabs would make a terrible mistake if they turn it into a global confrontation. No one else in the U.S. can do as much as I can. Look at what happened to ROGERS when he tried to bring about a total settlement all at once. We can not accept another oil embargo from the Arabs. I don't know what the Western Europeans will do, they are so weak and shortsighted. We have had reasonable communications from Egypt and Saudi Arabia since Rabat hut I will have to go to find out where things stand. The Soviets want to block any solitary U.S. initiative but what can they do if they succeed in blocking us? GROMYKO then will give me a long list of ten points and forty sub-points and demand that the US force Israel to accept them. If we do it, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> gets the credit. If not, we are blamed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Why should the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> get the credit?

                            </hi>: As a practical matter, it will end up as a total solution. But I believe we must go a few steps each time. We must decide if this is still a possibility. The Israelis should have given the West Bank to Jordan under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> administration and then have a plebiscite in 2-3 years. The PLO would have won. But now we are in a real mess. If the Arabs had made a secret arrangement to give the West Bank to the PLO after Hussein got it back, that would have been all right. But to do it this way is all wrong. If there is no solution, there will be a series of wars over the next 20-30 years, leading to the eventual destruction of Israel.</p>

                            </hi>: Tell them we stuck our necks out to uphold our China policy in Moscow. I told Kosygin very firmly what our China policy was. I told him we can't afford bad relations with China. We recognized China in 1960 before there was a problem with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. At that time the problem was with our ally, the USA. Now they want us to go back on good relations of 24 years. We will not do it but our relations with China will not harm Soviet interests. I told this to Kosygin.</p>

                            </hi>: Very good. There is the stupid quarrel over the name of the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Gulf. We have no problem with the name of the Indian Ocean. But if it comes to a crunch we will call it the Persian Gulf. Iran is our neighbor. Saudi Arabia is far away.</p>

                            </hi>: I have taken it philosophically. The SHAH is a Monarch and you can't question a Monarch! He will eventually awaken to the contradictions of his policy. Iran has a problem with Baluchistan and so do we. The SHAH has a concept of a new region from Ethiopia to Indonesia but we did not talk about it much.</p>

                        <p>CHARACTERIZED CERTAIN IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF PAKISTAN'S FOREIGN RELATIONS EARLIER IN THE YEAR. THE SIMLA PROCESS, INTERRUPTED BY INDIA'S PEACEFUL NUCLEAR EXPLOSION IN MAY, RESUMED ITS FORWARD PROGRESS. TIES WITH AFGHANISTAN REMAIN STRAINED, BUT THE EARLIER DETERIORATION WHICH HAD LED SOME TO FEAR IMMINENT ARMED CLASHES HAS SEEMINGLY BEEN STEMMED AND BOTH SIDES NOW SEEM DETERMNED TO AVOID OPEN CONFLICT. RELATIONS WITH ANOTHER SOUTH ASIAN STATE, BANGLADESH, REMAIN ON DEAD CENTER, HOWEVER. PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH IRAN APPEAR TO HAVE STABILIZED.</p>
                        <p>THE IMPORTANT ADVANCES SCORED ON THE PATH OF NORMALIZATION OF INDO-PAK RELATIONS SHOULD NOT OBSCURE THE CONTINUING EXISTENCE OF DEEP PAK SUSPICIONS OF INDIAN INTENTIONS IN THE SUBCONTINENT OR THE UNLIKELIHOOD, BARRING A PRESENTLY UNFORESEEN SUB-STANTIAL CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE HERE, THAT THESE FORWARD STEPS WILL LEAD TO A FORMAL SOLUTION OF WHAT THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> REGARDS AS ITS BASIC OUTSTANDING PROBLEM WITH INDIA, THE DISPUTE OVER KASHMIR. WHETHER THEY WILL PRODUCE A RESTORATION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IS SEEN, IN PAKISTAN, AS A MATTER FOR THE INDIANS TO DECIDE. PROSPECTS FOR AN IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS WITH AFGHANISTAN ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST; THE KEY WOULD APPEAR TO LIE IN KABUL RATHER THAN IN ISLAMABAD.</p>
                        <p>DESPITE MANY COMINGS AND GOINGS, INCLUDING A VISIT BY <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> TO MOSCOW AND BY SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> TO ISLAMABAD, THERE WAS LITTLE CHANGE OF ANY FUNDAMENTAL NATURE IN PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE MAJOR POWERS. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SATISFIED BY THEIR MOSCOW TALKS, THE PAKS REMAIN VERY WARY OF SOVIET INTENTIONS IN THE AREA AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> HAS CHANGED ITS BASICALLY PRO-INDIAN APPROACH TO THE SUBCONTINENT. THE SECRETARY'S VISIT HERE LATER IN OCTOBER WENT WELL, BUT LEFT UNRESOLVED OUR ONLY MAJOR BILATERAL PROBLEM WITH THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, THE ISSUE OF US SOUTH ASIAN MILITARY SUPPLY POLICY. THIS ISSUE, UNLESS SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED, WILL BECOME AN INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT POLITICAL PROBLEM FOR <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> TO HANDLE. PAK RELATIONS WITH PEKING REMAINED WARM. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN A PERCEPTIBLE LESSENING OF THE TENSION AND UNEASINESS WHICH HAD CHARACTERIZED CERTAIN IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF PAKISTAN'S FOREIGN RELATIONS</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

                        <p>EARLIER IN THE YEAR. THIS SENSE OF RELAXATION WAS PARTICULARLY NOTABLE IN PAKISTAN'S TIES WITH INDIA, THE KEY INDICATOR OF OVERALL CLIMATE, BUT IT WAS ALSO EVIDENT, IF TO A LESSER DEGREE, IN THE SIGNIFICANT AREA OF PAK-AFGHAN RELATIONS. PAK APPREHENSIONS OF DANGEROUS AND PURPOSEFUL COLLUSION BETWEEN THESE TWO STATES RECEDED MARKEDLY IN THE COURSE OF THE QUARTER.</p>
                        <p>2. INDIA. THE SIMLA PROCESS, INTERRUPTED BY PAKISTAN FOLLOWING INDIA'S NUCLEAR EXPLOSION IN MAY, RESUMED ITS FORWARD PROGRESS IN SEPTEMBER WITH THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF NEGOTIATIONS ON THE RESUMPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS LINKS AND THE EASING OF TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO SUBCONTINENTAL NEIGHBORS. ALTHOUGH KNOTTY LEGAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM THE HIJACKING OF AN INDIAN COMMERCIAL AIRLINER IN 1971 OBSTRUCTED ADVANCE ON THE NEXT ITEM OF THE SIMLA AGENDA, THE RESUMPTION OF CIVIL OVERFLIGHTS AND AIR LINKS, BOTH SIDES MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEIR INABILITY TO ACHIEVE A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE MID-NOVEMBER NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS ISSUE WOULD NOT DELAY PROGRESS TOWARD NORMALIZATION IN OTHER AREAS. THEIR SUCCESS IN AGREEING THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO LIFT THE NINE-YEAR TRADE EMBARGO BETWEEN THEM SERVED TO CONFIRM THESE GOOD INTENTIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. ALTHOUGH THE RESUMPTION OF THE SIMLA PROCESS IS A SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE GRATIFICATION TO THE US—BOTH THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> WERE AGAIN REMINDED OF THIS BY THE SECRETARY DURING HIS SUBCONTINENTAL VISIT IN LATE OCTOBER—IT IS UNLIKELY, BARRING A PRESENTLY UNFORESEEN CHANGE OF SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTIONS IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE HERE, TO LEAD TO A FORMAL SOLUTION OF WHAT THE PAKS REGARD AS THEIR BASIC OUTSTANDING PROBLEM WITH INDIA, THE DISPUTE OVER KASHMIR. RESPONSIBLE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> OFFICIALS EXPRESS DOUBT THAT THE PROGRESS ALREADY MADE CAN BUILD UP SUFFICIENT MOMENTUM TO BRING ABOUT AN AGREEMENT, NOR IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT PRIME MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> IS SEEKING TO EDUCATE PAKISTAN TO ACCEPT THE HARD POLITICAL REALITIES WHICH SUCH A SETTLEMENT COULD ENTAIL. THE PAKS THEMSELVES SEEM TO LOOK ON EACH SUCCESSIVE STEP IN THE SIMLA PROCESS LARGELY AS AN END IN ITSELF, TO BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF CONCRETE ADVANTAGE TO THEM,RATHER THAN AS A SERIES WHICH WILL CULMINATE IN A TRUE RECONCILIATION WITH INDIA.</p>

                        <p>4. ALTHOUG PROGRESS ON THE SIMLA ROAD HAS PROBABLY HELPED SOMEWHAT IN REDUCING PAK SUSPICIONS ABOUT INDIAN INTENTIONS IN THE SUBCONTINENT, THESE REMAIN SUBSTANTIAL. THEY WERE HEIGHTENED IN SEPTEMBER BY <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> MOVES IN SIKKIM, WHICH THE PAKS REGARDED AS FRESH EVIDENCE OF INDIAN HEGEMOISC DESIGN AND OF THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'S INSENSITIVITY TO THE FEELINGS OF SMALLER NEIGHBORS. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> APPREHENSIONS ABOUT INDIA'S NUCLEAR POTENTIAL, WHICH HAD EARLIER PROMPTED IT TO LAUNCH A DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE AMONG THE MAJOR POWERS TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR GUARANTEES, DISCOURAGE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND IMPROVE PAK MILITARY DETERRENT CAPABILITIES, LED PAKISTAN TO FURTHER VIGOROUS ACTION AT THE <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. THE GOP DEVOTED MUCH TIME AND TALENT TO PUSHING RESOLUTIONS THERE CALLING FOR A SOUTH ASIAN NUCLEAR FREE ZONE AND ENHANCED ASSURANCES FOR NON-NUCLEAR NATIONS. THE RESULTS WERE VIEWED IN PAKISTAN WITH CONSIDERABLE SATISFACTION, THOUGH THE PAKS ARE CERTAINLY AWARE THAT INDIA IS UNLIKELY TO FORESWEAR ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON OPTION WHATEVER DIPLOMATIC SUCCESSES THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> MAY HAVE ACHIEVED IN NEW YORK.</p>
                        <p>5. AFGHANISTAN. PAK-AFGHAN RELATIONS REMAIN STRAINED, BUT THE DETERIORATION WHICH HAD LED IN SOME QUARTERS TO APPREHENSION OF ARMED CLASHES HAS SEEMINGLY BEEN STEMMED AND BOTH SIDES NOW SEEM DETERMINED TO AVOID OPEN CONFLICT. ALTHOUGH FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES REMAINED BETWEEN A GOA COMMITED TO SELF-DETERMINATION FOR PUSHTU AND BALUCH AREAS WITHIN PAKISTAN AND A <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO BRING THE TRIBALS OF THESE BORDER AREAS INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF PAKISTAN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE, THE LEVEL OF INVECTIVE ON THE PART OF RESPONSIBLE LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES HAD DIMINISHED SOMEWHAT BY</p>

                        <p>THE END OF THE QUARTER. BUT PROPAGANDA CONTINUED WITHOUT APPRECIABLE LET UP—EACH SIDE HAS NOW TURNED TO ACCUSING THE OTHER OF PROMPTING AN EXIT OF REFUGEES—AND THE PAKS FOR THEIR PART REPORTED FRESH EVIDENCE OF <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> INVOLVEMENT IN VIOLENT INCIDENTS BOTH IN THE FRONTIER AREAS AND OUTSIDE “PAKHTUNISTAN" AND OF CONTINUING COLLUSION BETWEEN THE AFGHANS AND THE NORTH WEST FRONTIER-AND BALUCHISTAN-BASED OPPOSITION NATIONAL AWAMI PARTY.</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

                        <p>6. IN APPRAISING THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH AFGHANISTAN, THE PAKS MAINTAIN THAT THEY WILL BE SATISFIED WITH SOMETHING LESS THAN FORMAL <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> ABANDONMENT OF ITS PAKHTUNISTAN DEMANDS AND SAY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH AN ARRANGEMENT UNDER WHICH THE AFGHANS WOULD TONE DOWN THEIR ACTIVITY IN SUPPORT OF THESE CLAIMS TO THE LEVEL WHICH PREVAILED BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN COUP LAST YEAR. THEY STATE THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AFGHANS ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND ON OTHER ISSUES APART FROM THE PAKHTUNISTAN CLAIM, WHICH THEY REGARD AS A CALL FOR THE DISMEMBERMENT OF PAKISTAN HOWEVER IT MAY BE INTERPRETED BY KABUL. ALTHOUGH THE SECURITY AND POLITICAL SITUATIONS IN BALUCHISTAN HAVE IMPROVED AND THE IRANIANS HAVE APPARENTLY NOW MADE IT CLEAR TO THE <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> THAT THEY DO NOT LOOK KINDLY ON AFGHAN EFFORTS TO INTERNATIONALIZE THE INSURGENCY IN THAT PROVINCE, TWO DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE BOLSTERED PAK SELF-CONFIDENCE IN HANDLING THE PAKHTUNISTAN PROBLEM, THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> CONTINUES TO VIEW THE AFGHANS WITH DEEP SUSPICION. THEY ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS A MASSIVE BUILDUP BY THE SOVIETS OF AFGHAN ARMORED STRENGTH, AND CALLED THIS TO OUR ATTENTION DURING THE SECRETARY'S VISIT.</p>
                        <p>7. BANGLADESH. RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND AOTHER SOUTH ASIAN NATION, BANGLADESH, REMAIN ON DEAD CENTER. THE TWO COUNTRIES REMAIN AS FAR APART AS THEY DID WHEN TALKS BETWEEN BHUTTO AND BD PRIME MINISTER MUJIB ABORTED IN JUNE. TWO CONTENTIOUS ISSUES, THE DIVISION OF PRE-1971 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE FURTHER REPATRIATION OF BIHARIS TO PAKISTAN, REMAIN THE STUMBLING BLOCKS TO FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARD NORMALIZATION. BOTH SIDES APPEAR TO FEEL THAT THE FIRST MOVE TO GET MATTERS OFF THE DIME RESTS WITH THE OTHER. THE PAKS, FOR THEIR PART, SEEM TO TAKE A RELAXED VIEW OF THE IMPASSE. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BD IN ITS PRESENT PARLOUS STATE NEEDS THEM MORE THAN THEY NEED BD, AND THEY APPARENTLY DO NOT FEEL UNDER ANY SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC PRESSURE TO PROCEED FURTHER AT THIS TIME. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND THE RESTORATION OF TRADE TIES ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ATTRACTIVE ENDS TO INDUCE PAKISTAN TO MOVE IN THE ABSENCE OF WORD FROM DACCA OF A SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION IN THE <gloss target="#t_BDG1">BDG</gloss> POSITION.</p>
                        <p>CONFIDENTIAL</p>

                        <p>8. IRAN. PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH IRAN APPEAR TO HAVE STABILIZED. THE PAKS HAVE NOW LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THE SHAH'S MORE EVEN-HANDED POLICY IN SOUTH ASIA, HOWEVER MUCH THEY MAY REGRET THE PASSING OF WHAT FOR THEM WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF IRAN'S PRO-PAKISTAN STANCE. IRAN'S FRIENDSHIP, EVEN ON THE REDUCED SCALE IT IS NOW OFFERED, CONTINUES TO MEAN A GREAT</p>
                        <p>DEAL TO PAKISTAN IN SEVERAL AREAS, PARTICULARLY IN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>'S EFFORTS TO QUELL THE BALUCHISTAN INSURGENCY. ON THE LATTER FRONT, THE PAKS HAVE BEEN GRATIFIED BY THE SHAH'S DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO DETER THE AFGHANS AND COOL THE SITUATION(A SENIOR IRANIAN OFFICIAL WAS SENT TO KABUL AND ISLAMABAD WITH THESE ENDS IN VIEW) AND BY AN IRANIAN LOAN OF HELICOPTERS. PAK PARTICIPATION IN THE CENTO NAVAL EXERCISE MIDLINK 74 ALSO REINFORCED CONTACTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIS (AND STRENGTHENED MILITARY TIES WITH PAKISTAN'S OTHER <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> PARTNERS), AS DID <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S BRIEF STOPOVER IN TEHRAN FOLLOWING HIS OCTOBER VISIT TO MOSCOW. ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF MILD PAK ANNOYANCE WITH SOME OF THE SHAH'S MORE IMPERIAL REGIONAL PRETENSIONS, THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> AND THE PAK PRESS ARE CAREFUL TO AVOID ANY PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF THIS AND TO DESIST FROM ANY QUESTIONING OF IRANIAN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INITIATIVES. THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE SHAH'S SUSCEPTIBILITIES AND HAVE DOUBTLESS CONCLUDED THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN AND MUCH TO LOSE IN THE SURFACING OF SUCH MISGIVINGS.</p>
                        <p>9. THE MAJOR POWERS: THE UNITED STATES. THERE WASMUCH COMING AND GOING INVOLVING PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE MAJOR POWERS, BUT LITTLE CHANGE OF ANY FUNDAMENTAL NATURE TOOK PLACE. SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>'S VISIT TO THE SUBCONTINENT, BILLED PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF IMPROVING INDO-US RELATIONS, HAD CAUSED SOME ADVANCE APPREHENSION IN PAKISTAN. IT WAS FEARED THAT IN HIS EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT CLOSER TIES WITH NEW DELHI, THE SECRETARY WOULD SACRIFICE THE INTERESTS OF THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>. THESE APPREHENSIONS WERE NOT REALIZED, AND THE TALKS HELD HERE SUBSEQUENTLY, CARRIED OUT IN THE CANDID, INFORMAL MANNER WHICH HAS CHAR1</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> MEETINGS, WENT WELL. THE PAKS WERE PARTICULARLY PLEASED BY THE SECRETARY'S RENEWED EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN'S INTEGRITY AND SECURITY AND FOR PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">FORD</persName>'S INVITATION TO <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> TO VISIT WASHINGTON EARLY IN 1975.</p>
                        <p>10. THE TALKS STILL LEFT UNSETTLED THE ONLY MAJOR PROBLEM IN BILATERAL US-PAK RELATIONS, THE ISSUE OF US ARMS SUPPLY POLICY IN SOUTH ASIAA. RESPONSIBLE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> LEADERS, IF NOT THE BROADER PUBLIC, WERE SUFFICIENTLY SOPHISTICATED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE SECRETARY WOULD BE UNABLE TO AGREE TO THE CHANGES PAKISTAN HAS PUBLICLY SOUGHT (I.E. THE LIFTING OF THE EMBARGO ON THE SHIPMENT OF LETHAL WEAPONS) A MERE 24 HOURS AFTER HE HAD LEFT NEW DELHI, AND <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SPOKE UP FORCEFULLY IN AN EFFORT TO ALLAY THE GENERAL SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH HE WAS AWARE WOULD NONETHELESS FOLLOW THE ABSENCE OF ANY REFERENCE TO THE MATTER IN THE JOINT US-PAK STATEMENT. BUT HOWEVER SUCCESSFUL THE PRIME MINISTER MAY HAVE BEEN IN THIS EFFORT, IT IS CLEAR THAT PAK PATIENCE ON THIS LONG-STANDING</p>

                        <p>PROBLEM IS GROWING INCREASINGLY THIN AND THAT THE MATTER, UNLESS SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED, WILL BECOME A MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT POLITICAL ISSUE FOR BHUTTO TO HANDLE.</p>

THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S TWICE-POSTPONED VISIT TO THE SOVIET UNION TOOK PLACE ON THE EVE OF THE SECRETARY'S TRIP TO ISLAMABAD.

                        <p>MOMENT TO ADOPT A MORE EVEN-HANDED APPROACH TO SOME OF THEIR PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THEY HAVE WITH AFGHANISTAN AND BANGLADESH. BUT THE PAKS ARE UNDER NO ILLUSIONS THAT THE VISIT WILL LEADE TO ANY FUNDAMENTAL REORDERING IN THE SOVIETS' BASICALLY PRO-INDIAN VIEW OF SOUTH ASIA. THEY REMAIN VERY WARY OF <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> INTENTIONS IN THE AREA, AND DO NOT RULE OUT FURTHER SOVIET FISHING IN TROUBLED SUBCONTINENTAL WASTERS—TO PAKISTAN'S DETRIMENT—SHOULD IT SUIT MOSCOW'S PURPOSES TO DO SO.</p>
                        <p>12. CHINA. IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS IN MOSCOW, THE PAKS WERE CAREFUL TO STRESS THAT ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> COULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR TIES WITH CHINA. THESE REMAIN VERY CLOSE, AND THE EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL AND SEMI-OFFICIAL DELEGATIONS PRAISING EACH OTHER'S COUNTRY IS STANDARD FARE. IN A CRUCIAL UNITED NATIONS TEST, PAKISTAN WITHSTOOD STRONG PRESSURE FROM THE US AND THE ASEAN NATIONS AND SUPPORTED THE CHINESE POSITION ON KHMER RECOGNITION, THOUGH IT DID NOT TAKE A LEAD IN THIS EFFORT. (THE PAKS EXPLAINED TO US THAT IN TERMS OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE PRC THEY WOULD NOT AFFORD TO DO OTHERWISE.) THE PAKS HAILED THE SHARP PRC REACTION TO INDIA'S MOVE IN SIKKIM, CHEERFULLY SEEING IN IT A XZK ENKHBH</p>

                        <p>13. THIRD WORLD AND MUSLIM NATIONS. WHILE PROFESSING ITSELF A MODERATE AND EXPRESSING PRIVATE CONSTERNATION AT THE STEAMROLLER TACTICS OF THE “NON-ALIGNED” BLOC IN THE <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, THE PAKS ORDINARILY VOTE WITH THAT GROUP.

PAK-ARAB MILITARY RELATIONS REMAIN CLOSE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS SOME APPREHENSION IN ISLAMABAD THAT THE DRAIN OF PAF PILOTS SECONDED TO THE MIDEAST PLACES A STRAIN ON PAKISTAN'S OWN AIR DEFENSE CAPABILITIES. (THIS POSSIBLE STRAIN IS BALANCED BY THE OBVIOUS POLITICAL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS INVOLVED, AND BY THE EXPECTATION THAT THE PAKS WILL BE ABLE TO RECALL THEIR PILOTS, POSSIBLY WITH THEIR ARAB PLANES, IN EVENT OF NEED.) THE PAKS CONTINUE THEIR PURSUIT OF FUNDS FROM THE OIL-RICH ARAB STATES, AND THOUGH NO NEW CREDITS OR GRANTS HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE SAUDIS HAVE RECENTLY AGREED TO PROVIDE FURTHER LARGE SUMS. AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE, THE PAKS HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN GETTNG CONCESSIONAL TERMS FOR THEIR PETROLEUM NEEDS, HOEVER.</p>
                        <p>14. PROGNOSIS. RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN WILL CONTINUE TO BE KEY AREAS TO WATCH IN THE COMING MONTHS. NO FURTHER TALKS AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL BETWEEN THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> AND THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> ARE PRESENTLY IN THE CARDS, THOUGH EXPERTS' DISCUSSIONS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION TO LIFT THE TRADE EMBARGO ARE DUE IN JANUARY. THE PAKS ARE TAKING A RELAXED ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FAILURE OF THE NOVEMBER CIVIL AVIATION TALKS AND PROFESS TO CONSIDER THE MATTER OF LIMITED SIGNIFICANCE; THEY WILL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IF ANY BREAKTHROUGH IS ACHIEVED IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THEY REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF A SETTLEMENT BETWEEN <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND SHEIKH <persName corresp="p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> ON THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS, BUT MAINTAIN THAT THE “TENSION” WHICH THIS WILL CREATE WILL NOT ENDANGER PROGRESS ALREADY MADE. THE DECISION ON THE RESTORATION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS APPEARS TO REST AT THIS TIME WITH THE INDIANS. THE PAKISTANIS HAVE DETERMINED NOT TO PRESS FURTHER ON THE ISSUE, PROBABLY</p>

                        <p>BECAUSE THEY MAY CONSIDER THAT THIS WOULD BE VIEWED AS A BARGAINING COUNTER BY THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. PAK INTEREST IN AN EXCHANGE OF PERMANENT MISSIONS COULD WANE, OF COURSE, WERE AN <persName corresp="#p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName>- INDIA AGREEMENT OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS TO PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE.</p>
                        <p>15. THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE COURSE OF RELATIONS WITH AFGHANISTAN IS DIFFICULT TO FORECASE. FROM OUR VIEWPOINT, THE KEY WOULD APPEAR TO LIE IN KABUL RATHER THAN IN ISLAMABAD. PROSPECTS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SATISFACTORY MODUS VIVENDI IF NOT FOR A REAL RECONCILIATION SEEM BETTER NOW THAN THEY WERE THREE MONTHS AGO.</p>
                        <p>16. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES CAN BE FORESEEN IN PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH CHINA OR THE SOVIET UNION OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THE COURSE OF US-PAK RELATIONS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY WASHINGTN'S DECISION ON THE ARMS SUPPLY ISSUE.</p>

                        <p>REQUEST, IN MEETING WITH <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> REPORTED <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>, FOR CHANGE OF VOTE FROM ABSTENTION TO SUPPORT. HE TOLD YAQUB THAT HE HAD REVIEWED MATTER CLOSELY WITH ALL CONCERNED OFFICES IN DEPARTMENT AND THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CHANGE OUR POSITION TO ONE OF SUPPORT FOR THE RES IN PLENARY VOTE. HE ADDED THAT YAQUB'S DEMARCHE DID, HOWEVER, MAKE AN IMPACT AND THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>'S CONCERNS WOULD CERTAIN- LY WEIGH IN THE BALANCE IN THE FUTURE.</p>
                        <p>2. AMB YAQUB EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR OUR REVIEW OF THE MATTER AND NOTED THAT HE REALIZED ISSUE WAS PROBABLY TOO FAR ADVANCED FOR US TO CHANGE POSITION.</p>
                        <p>3. FYI. BASIC CONCLUSION OF REVIEW WAS THAT US FIRST COMMITTEE POSITION, BASED ON UNDESIRABILITY OF <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> ACTION ON SANFZ PROPOSAL IN LIGHT OF VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES PUT FORWARD IN PAKISTANI AND INDIAN RESES, REMAINS VALID. WE ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIVE PROBLEMS WITH PAKISTANI RES STATEMENT THAT A SANFZ WOULD ENTAIL</p>
                        <p>UNDERTAKINGS BY NUCLEAR-WEAPON STATES NOT TO USE OR THREATEN THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND IMPLICIT ASSUMPTION IN RES THAT PARTIES WOULD HAVE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT OF INDIGENOUS PNE CAPABILITY. ANY EXPLANATION OF CHANGED VOTE WE COULD GIVE WOULD HAVE TO BE QUALIFIED BY REFERENCES TO OUR CONCERNS FOR FULL REGIONAL COOPERATION, ACCEPTABLE TREATMENT OF PNE ISSUE, AND OUR RESERVATIONS ON NON-USE UNDERTAKINGS. NET RESULT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE TO ANTAGONIZE INDIANS WITHOUT FULLY SATISFYING PAKISTANIS AND WITHOUT FURTHERING SANFZ CONCEPT OR CONSTRUCTIVELY SERVING OUR BROADER NON-PROLIFERATION OBJECTIVES. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, CONTINUED US ABSTENTION WAS CONSIDERED BEST COURSE. END FYI.</p>

                        <p>Secretary: I want the Commission to establish the maximum possible relationship in the most creative possible manner. With India, perhaps the economics are not so fruitful, but in the field of education and science there should be ample opportunities. I would like to use non-governmental resources as well. I would like the commissions to do things imaginatively. Americans should be good at being innovative. One area about which I am fanatic is food production. I cannot get people to focus on this. I would like a coherent policy and program that deals with food, fertilizers, pesticide, water. More generally, I have the conviction that if we do not find new ways to relate to other countries, Congressional restrictions will make it increasingly difficult for us to do business abroad. How are you developing the education program?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Goheen: We have a number in the group who are very knowledgeable and we should be able to tap them.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d186-02" facs="d186-02"/>
                        <p>Secretary: What do you want to do?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Goheen: We are still feeling our way, but some of the traditional things seem to have merit. There are important differences of cross-cultural communication to be overcome. There are a number of interesting joint research projects we can develop. In the academic world there needs to be more discussion of mutual interests and points of friction. There is scope for more exchanges in the arts and culture. But as yet we have no sense we have a real handle on what to do.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: It is true that the connection between Indian and American intellectuals has weakened during the past decade. Frankly, you are better staying away from political topics like discussions on non-alignment and neutralism with the Indians. Some of their more obnoxious characteristics are a sign of defensiveness. I think this can be overcome to some extent. When is <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> coming?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: We have spoken of the third week in March.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Can I do it then? Isn't there the Buenos Aires meeting?</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary: We will check.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: When do the groups meet?</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary: All three are meeting in January or early February, two here and one in India.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: This is a major effort and I appreciate your taking it on. I have no guidance on specifics, but will be glad to comment on proposals you make. I am in favor of doing this first class and big in terms of projects. What about an Indian art show like the Chinese exhibit? I was struck by the feeling of history this conveys. Even though I had seen the individual pieces in China, the setting here makes a great deal of difference. I don't know what we could do in return for an Indian show. Has there been one recently?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Goheen: I don't think so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ENDERS: How energetic do you want us to be in the economic/commercial group? Not in terms of giving things away or aid but in terms of removing barriers to trade and investment.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d186-03" facs="d186-03"/>
                        <p>Secretary: I am in favor of the maximum number of ties. However, we cannot promise funds since we will not get Congressional support.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary: The Indians have been objecting to foreign investment for a long time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ENDERS: There are some things that we can do.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I think it is important to let the Indians feel that by moving toward us they are not moving toward another bureaucratic morass.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ENDERS: One problem is the question of how to associate the private sector with the subcommission. Because of antitrust and other problems, this is difficult. We are unable to work closely with the private sector the way others do, like the Germans. They are able to tie up an entire package at once. Just associating Chambers of Commerce is not good enough.</p>

                        <p>The session opened with an exchange of pleasantries and mention of a discussion earlier in the day whether the next NATO meeting would be held in London.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: I had lunch last week with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>. His attitude was interesting. He said the $50 million in aid we were offering was so small they might turn it down. He also complained we were only offering 250,000 tons of wheat under PL 480 Title I.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: If they don't want our aid, we won't push it on them. We won't bargain with them to take aid.</p>

                        <p>Secretary: There is something rather nuts about this issue. The Indians can get arms from the Russians. They have their own industry. And the Pakistanis don't have this.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d187-02" facs="d187-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: It seems illogical for us to get in the middle of a regional dispute. If the President plans to come out, arms to Pakistan will blow him out of the water.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: We have not made a decision. I am slightly leaning toward a small arms sale to Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: Might as well make it a big one. Why do we want to back into a regional confrontation?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: All Ambassadors to India say arms to Pakistan will undermine our position. That's part of their job. What do you think, Roy?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: We think there will be an Indian reaction. Possibly Chavan will postpone his visit. It could well freeze the Joint Commission.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: It would also make me pretty unpopular in India.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I'll be the unpopular guy. I have been through that before.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: But what do we get out of this in the long run? We should keep out of a regional hassle.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: No one is telling us to stay out of economic aid which the Indians can convert to arms from the Soviet Union. The Pakistanis are not in as good a position.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: Yes, but the Pakistanis get arms from China and from France.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: France puts them at the end of the list and China doesn't have much.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: Pakistan's real protection comes from Iran and the OPEC countries. She has close ties with other Muslim countries and there is not much India can do about this. I think with India's dependence on Iran and its hopes with the Arabs, it will be careful. This gives Pakistan a special position. Do you have any special instructions for me?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: When are you leaving?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: I will be around until after <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> leaves. I am planning to leave about February 15 and arrive February 21 or 22.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d187-03" facs="d187-03"/>
                        <p>Secretary: Forgetting about arms, which is not yet decided and on which we may not make a decision for a month or so after <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> comes-</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: I thought he was assuming we would be.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Why did we schedule <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in early February?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: It just came out that way. On the trip you talked of early in the year.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: That means until April.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: Does the Bangladesh coup change anything?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Things are going exactly as predicted. I never thought Bangladesh would be a democracy. Did you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: I never thought it would amount to anything. I toured the entire country last year and things were in a mess.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: During the Bangladesh war, I called the place a basket case and this was in the press.</p>
                        <p>About India, we have improved relations. We are eager to continue this process. We don't want too high a visibility which might upset the Chinese who loathe the Indians, but we are anxious for steady improvement. The President may go later in the year. I don't think we should pay anything for that. Don't let Tikki Kaul tell us that this or that move would cloud the visit.</p>
                        <p>We are interested in India. It is a democracy. It is the largest underdeveloped country. We want to help them in their development, but we don't want to be blackmailed by them. I would like to put emphasis behind the Joint Commission. In fact, our relations with them have been progressing along quite well. We don't expect them to support us all the time on international issues.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: But we don't expect them to kick us in the ass either. I told that to <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName> the other day. Congress is mad at India. Now the big papers are questioning India because of their PLO stand. From what I gather, they are also losing support among their university friends. They are using up their good will.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I hope you will make that clear in India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> had some interesting comments on their nuclear test. He says it was disastrous for them. If the PAKS also go nuclear, then there is again military parity between the two and India loses its advantage.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d187-04" facs="d187-04"/>
                        <p>Secretary: Yes, that is true. The major thing is that we recognize India as a great power. We want good relations. We see no basic conflict of interest. We have no desire to upset the balance of power in the subcontinent. But they have to show respect for our concerns and in fact their record lately has not been too bad.</p>
                        <p>I would like the Indians to realize that we are not using China against them, but I don't want to promote better Sino-Indian relations in a way that makes the Chinese nervous. This is not particularly in our interest. Be especially careful what you say on this. The Chinese do not believe in such a thing as uninstructed Ambassadors. It is almost certainly true that if the Chinese attacked we would support India, but we don't want the Chinese to think we are dumping them for the Indians. If you are asked by the Indians about their relations with China, say that we have absolutely no objection to an improvement. But I would avoid getting into this in public.</p>
                        <p>Roy, are there other issues to be covered?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">Atherton</persName>: The nuclear question.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: When I talked of this in Delhi, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> said they would not accept bilateral controls, but would possibly participate with multilateral controls. We have given her a paper with our ideas. We passed this through her Secretary P.N. DHAR. He is apparently a good man. We would like to find out what their response is.</p>
                        <p>I also like <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> although he is not very eloquent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: His experience in dealing with us is not bad.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Yes, <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> is all right. The major thing for an American Ambassador in India is to be sympathetic but strong. We are committed to improving relations, but our experience is that every once in a while you will get clobbered.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: I like the people very much.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: That is a real asset. You know they asked for you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>: I also like the food.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: That is a terrific asset if you like their food. I can't even stand the smell of it.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I can remember when I first met Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> in 1953. I was on a subcommittee on foreign aid.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: I was Assistant Secretary for <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: You had just gotten out of the military. I am pleased to have you here, Mr. Prime Minister, as well as your wife and your two children.</p>
                        <p>My whole career I have felt that American foreign policy has to look at the whole world and not just in its narrow interests. For us to lapse into the policy of the 1920s and 30s would be disaster. So we want to work with you and other countries for stability and progress. Our efforts — and those of all the departments of our Government — will aim at that.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d188-02" facs="d188-02"/>
                        <p>You have traveled recently. I would appreciate hearing your observations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: I wish to thank you for your hospitable welcome. I am sorry to impose on the American taxpayers. I was here just last year, but there are so many complex issues I thought we needed this opportunity to exchange views. Thank you for asking about my children. <persName>Ahmed</persName> thinks undergraduates should study at home and go abroad afterward. I disagree — I went to Berkeley in 1947 and I learned much and I admire the vitality and strength of the United States.</p>
                        <p>For two decades, to those of us who live in the Middle East and South Asia, the American presence was thought to be omnipresent. Now the view is that the American presence is weakening. I think now this view is accurate. But if the pendulum swings too far, it is bad. We don't think the U.S. is exhausted and that after Vietnam, the U.S. wants to withdraw into a shell. We welcome your statements that the U.S. must play a strong role in the world. There are some basic factors on which we rely. For us — especially after 1971 when we broke up. I was in New York and met <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: The Prime Minister took over under very tragic conditions and behaved magnificently.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: It was a painful experience, but the U.S. behaved very responsibly in stabilizing the situation and not letting it fall to pieces.</p>
                        <p>We don't understand India's objections to the relative stability of Pakistan. India idea seems to be total security for India and total insecurity for Pakistan. We can understand her wanting to be recognized as the most powerful and most important power in South Asia, but she abuses that. It was India which previously dismembered us, with Soviet help. In Kashmir also, India behaved badly and now is maneuvering again.</p>
                        <p>India is not our only neighbor. We have good relations with all of them and are working to improve those with Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>For the last three years—and really since 1965 we have been discussing this [arms embargo] matter. We have not tried to add to your complications. Our attitude is of patience and understanding. But the international situation has become more complex and a policy change is now more imperative. If it is a matter of timing, I would like to give a thought or two. The situation may get more complex. With Congress, the Turkey matter is a tragedy. Congressmen think when they are elected they become foreign policy experts.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d188-03" facs="d188-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: The Congress have put us in a very difficult situation with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: The Prime Minister knows Turkey well through his <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> as associations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Congress is now very defensive on it. It is a matter of how they can extricate themselves and save face. We are working on it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: Ecevit had to take the action he did. His position was so tenuous, with the military, he had to do that. An embargo on allies, one after another, is not the best way to run a good alliance. So we think the passage of time may complicate this. Basically, the position of Turkey and Pakistan is the same. As time passes, the disenchantment between Pakistan and Congress increases.</p>
                        <p>As far as India is concerned, we have taken the Simla route. Now India, if the embargo is not lifted, will say she has won; if it is, she will say it is a slap in the face.</p>
                        <p>If on the merits — the substance — there is agreement, I am ready to talk about the timing.</p>
                        <p>Putting myself in your shoes, which I try to do, I think with the Congressional situation, the Simla process maturing, the Middle East, and so on, that now is the most valuable time to come. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> is coming next month. There will be much speculation. If it happens after that, India will be more aggrieved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: It is obvious that <persName>Henry</persName> and I have worked together very closely. Our views are identical. When he speaks, he speaks for me. Our views have matched. On the substance, you are correct — we have decided to go along with the matter of sales. It is a matter of timing, so let's forget the substance.</p>
                        <p>I understand your interest in the revised announcement. We have some problems. <persName>Henry</persName>, why don't you explain.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We promised India we would give them a chance to comment before making a decision. That will take a few days, and we have to do it.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Next week, I and all my people will be out of the country if there is a Congressional uproar. If <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> cancels his trip, that would compound the problem. so we have two options</hi>: To announce it in two weeks and take our chances on <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>, or hold until after his visit. In either case, the decision won't change. We have created a climate for the change and we can probably manage. The choice is to do it the end of this month or in early April. The decision won't change. The question is how to proceed and what to say now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Let me give you something which might be helpful in a decision. I decided Saturday on the PL 480 allotments. You know we promised you 100,000 tons; my decision allows us to provide you 300,000 more tons. We have not yet announced it, but we can do that any time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Henry</persName>, do you want to say something on the Middle East?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: Our plan is as follows: I don't plan to settle anything on this trip, but to tell Israel some facts of life. The chances of another settlement are about 60-40 by the middle of March. That will create a good climate for April, but we want your views.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            </hi>: I want to be candid and speak our point of view. With all due respect to <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>, he made a tempest in a teacup by agreeing with the Indian position. In the Algerian war, the French were doing barbaric things but always defended their position. They never flinched. To hear <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName> support India — which is music to their ears — is an act of a simpleton. He has a simple face — I didn't know his mind matched.</p>
                        <p>It is not a matter of an arms race. We can't match India. We didn't take exception to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s statement about India's being the principal state in the subcontinent — though we don't agree. We kept quiet. The U.S. has chosen in the past to spoil India. But now, her position is so precarious — there may be a few speeches in Parliament, and a few articles, but weighted in the balance it will be a tempest in a teacup. So I think it is better to do it before <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> comes, so you don't have to argue it out with him and he goes back to say he failed. Putting it off I think makes it more complicated.</p>

                            </hi>: I agree. But I am baffled by the limitation of $25 million. Weapons are expensive. That is a slap in the face.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: That was your figure. We wouldn't announce a figure, just cash sales. The important thing is the principle — this would allow third-country sales. You must permit us to manage it here — we will stress the defensiveness of your needs. We say it is not right to embargo a friend, and it's strengthening your defensive capability. Once it is lifted, the Congress would need an act to change it. We will emphasize the small size and the defensive character at first to minimize the reaction. If the weapons would be TOW rather than attack aircraft, that would help. We can work out a schedule.</p>

                            </hi>: You have other things to take up with him — commercial credits, fertilizer, etcetera.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Second, on PL 480</hi>: We are very grateful. But I came all this way for scotch and soda and got a Coca Cola. The PL 480 is now more important than the arms, but it is a matter of presentation. We will have to make adjustments. So if you could announce it by the end of February, we would appreciate it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: I am not clear how you want the PL 480.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: In low key.</p>

                            </hi>: We could put it in a joint statement.</p>
                        <p>If we could say to the Congress that we had discussed your nuclear program, that would help much. If we could say we achieved some nuclear <pb n="6" xml:id="d188-06" facs="d188-06"/>restraint for some help in conventional arms, that really would defuse the opposition. Because HAMILTON said “what will you get for it?”</p>

                            </hi>: We are always frank in our relations. You know where we are on this — you have your people there. We have made some progress. We have some good people and it is within reach not like some Arab states. We come after India in capability. I am not enchanted by the grandiose notion that we must explode something, no matter how dirty, if our security needs are met. I want to spend the money on something else. We will have a nuclear program, but if our security is assured, we will be reasonable.</p>

                            </hi>: If you could formulate something — we can discuss it further this afternoon. Some sort of statement would really help. I think the Congress will consider it conclusive, and with all the other problems we have now, it would help.</p>
                        <p>We are not unrealistic about the facts of life. The Japanese could have weapons in six months, but in this time frame it would be useful.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Coming from you it would be better than from us and look good on the Hill.</p>

                            </hi>: It would make you look good in comparison with India. They lost a great deal by their explosion.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, and they set theirs off right on our border and didn't expect us to react. The Indians also say that arms will upset the balance in South Asia aid destroy Simla. If that is their attitude, it is better to find out, Simla works best if both sides have security. As the Indian Ambassador said…</p>

                        <p>COPIES TO: S; S/S; <gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss> (General <persName corresp="#p_SB3">Scowcroft</persName>)</p>
                        <p>THE PRIME MINISTER: I want to thank you for your support. I deeply appreciate it.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: The way you worked on Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> I couldn't do anything else.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: We should have done it earlier.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Since she was there with me during my last trip to South Asia she has developed an enormous affection for Pakistan. It was the highlight of the trip for her.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: The highlight for me when I last visited Pakistan with you, Mr. Secretary, was what the Prime Minister said, when he told <pb n="2" xml:id="d189-02" facs="d189-02"/>his Chief of Protocol to give you the royal treatment. He said so many heads of state who are boobs are treated so well, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> needed more. Were you married the last time you went, Mr. Secretary?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What was the significance of whether I was married or not?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: Well, they were working on Nancy…</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Don't explain. You make it worse. When I travel with Nancy in communist countries, when we go into the bedroom, I say so all the bugs can hear, “Shouldn't we get married now that we are traveling together?”</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Marriage is in their eyes a bourgeois institution.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: They are more puritanical than we are.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, I am very happy to see you, to have this opportunity to strengthen my personal relations with you. I am always pleased to hear from you about the world situation. I don't believe the American people trust your intelligence. You are more European.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have no trouble with the people. My problem is with the press.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: This decision affects my country but I am sure objectively history will endorse it.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I am sure of it, too. Otherwise I would not recommend doing it. Let's agree on the public position. We will announce it after my return, about the 20th of February. We'll tell the Indians and the Congress, beginning at the end of next week. We'll suggest a date to you. No technical or formal decision has been taken. However, it is my firm judgment that we will do this. This is a commitment. But we must be in a position to say we have this under final review after your discussions with the President, but no final decision has been taken. I know you understand this.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: We've done this very carefully up to now. Your White House spokesman used the phrase, “under active consideration”. We'll use that phrase, too.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d189-03" facs="d189-03"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You have been very good. The problem is within my own department. It's better now, though. They only leak the facts. They're not working against me. Morale must be better!</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Apart from the pleasure of seeing you, I always appreciate the constructive discussions we have on world issues. I believe your next trip will be beneficial in terms of results.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That depends on the Israelis. Also we need something from the Egyptians, a quid pro quo so the Israelis can save face. <persName corresp="#p_SASM1">Sadat</persName> is wise enough to understand that. If you have a chance with the Syrians you can repeat what I have said. They will take it seriously coming from you. [To <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>] Will I run into you on this trip in the area?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: No danger of it this time.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: But do let us know if we can do anything.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: There will be no final settlement, but hopefully we will be successful in the next step.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: As you have outlined the step-by-step approach, there is really no difference between that and a meeting of the Geneva Conference.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Anything you can do in public to make that point would be most helpful, only the American press does not seem to understand that there is no difference. A Geneva Conference would soon deadlock and dissolve into a step-by-step approach. There would not be an overall settlement. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> wouldn't permit it. He has been working on the Middle East since 1959. He spends 90 percent of his time on it. What would he do if we had a settlement?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: South Asia would keep me busy.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: We won't give you any problems with South Asia.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: It is remarkable what you have done in South Asia to reconcile your differences on your own.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d189-04" facs="d189-04"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What are your views on China?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: The press often asks me this. I tell them that if they think after Mao there will be a reversion to war lords and struggles of the old China, they are wrong. Yes, there may be dislocations and some fall-out when the great giant disappears, but I don't see any big changes. Now, Sino-Soviet relations might change.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Chou En-Lai is really remarkable hiding out in the hospital for a year. I would like to do that and place all my people in key positions and manipulate them from the hospital bed.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Of course the struggle in China with the extremists will continue.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: The so-called victory of Chou En-Lai is overdrawn. The whole leadership is over 70. They will all go at the same time.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: There the tangible factor is of Sino-Soviet relations and the changes that might occur after Mao.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It would be a grave mistake for the Chinese to move irrevocably toward the Soviets. In the first place the Soviets won't trust the Chinese and secondly the Chinese would be at the Soviets' mercy. I don't think they will do it.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: And of course the territorial dispute is still there and it is a very long border.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Has the Chinese attitude toward the U.S. cooled?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I think they feel that there has been a lack of progress on the Shanghai communique.</p>
                        <p>[To <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>] You were there recently. Do they talk to you about this?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: Yes. I talked to the Foreign Minister. He was very understanding about this. They didn't seem in any great hurry.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Our impression is the same. The Chinese do not seem particularly anxious about our relationship. You are going to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this afternoon?</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d189-05" facs="d189-05"/>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We'll see if Senator Sparkman knows who you are. Last week when Prime Minister WILSON went up there Sparkman tried to seat CALLAGHAN in the Prime Minister's seat and WILSON in CALLAGHAN's chair. Someone pointed out to him that he had made a mistake so he tried to put Ambassador Ramsbotham in the Prime Minister's chair. He never did get WILSON into the Prime Minister's seat.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, if the Tories win again he won't have any trouble understanding who the Prime Minister is. Has she won it? I believe she won the second ballot.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: It's not final yet but there is no contest.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Mr. SHAHI is our only fissionable material. SHAHI, what can you say on the subject the Secretary raised this morning?</p>
                        <p>MR. SHAHI: We have agreed to safeguards on the facilities that we have. There is no way of carrying out a clandestine program of trying to go nuclear. We have only a 130 megawatt reactor which is under safeguards. We are a long way from having the capability.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Could we say that you have assured us that you intend to observe safeguards, that there will be no nuclear development outside of safeguards? Yesterday when I was before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in closed session, I briefed the Committee on the arms problem and on some of the things we were thinking of. Lee Hamilton asked me, “What do you get out of this?” I answered that for me it was a matter of principle. Lee Hamilton, whose reaction on the arms problem will be a key factor, asked if Pakistan could not do something in the nuclear field. I have tried to prepare the way in my statements. I have said in India that we would not fuel an arms race but I have left the door open. If the Indians have read my statements carefully they should have the message. We will draft some things we think you should say after the President makes the decision final; a draft that says Pakistan intends to observe safeguards and will not undertake any experiments outside the scope of the safeguards.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d189-06" facs="d189-06"/>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I will be asked about the non-proliferation treaty. Our objections to that are on a moral basis. India has not signed. Of course we will sign if India signs.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Of course under safeguards you couldn't divert your efforts to a nuclear explosion.</p>
                        <p>MR. SHAHI: The Soviets now appear to be making a distinction on peaceful nuclear explosions and we understand the United States is prepared to study it.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Absolutely not. We agreed with the Soviets to study the threshold on peaceful explosions but we are not proceeding on this. We have found there is no way to distinguish between a peaceful explosion and weapons technology. I always tell the Indians when they talk about their peaceful explosion that it is nonsense. There is no way to make this distinction. Perhaps there is a theoretical distinction for the United States and the Soviet Union with their highly sophisticated technology, but there is no distinction for emerging nuclear powers. Our position on safeguards is clear. It does not permit diversions.</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">BYROADE</persName>: Is the Prime Minister to say something here?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It would be better if you say it is something you have raised with us and you have it under active consideration. The Indians have the bomb and there is concern for proliferation. You understand the concerns of President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and the Secretary over proliferation questions and these are under active consideration. We can marry the two “active considerations”. Two weeks from now it makes it more interesting when we make our announcement and you indicate that you are committed to place your nuclear installations under safeguards.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: The South Asia Nuclear Free Zone will come up again.</p>
                        <p>MR. SHAHI: The Prime Minister's position is that we need a political solution to India's nuclear threat. We need security assurances by the nuclear powers for non-nuclear states. Perhaps there could be a restrictive formula that covered only countries outside of alliances.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d189-07" facs="d189-07"/>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: One of the problems with that is the Soviets would use it against us.</p>
                        <p>MR. SHAHI: China also wants it.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We have a problem with the concept of nonuse of nuclear weapons. We can't defend Europe. We have to be free, we have to have the flexibility to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states. It is only in Europe that we would use them. For example, in the event of a European war we might have to use them in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter for the United Nations. We can leave this aside and talk about bilateral matters.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: If the Indians used a nuclear weapon against Pakistan we would view it with the utmost gravity and the world would view it with the utmost gravity.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I have said many times that I am committed to the Simla process. We agreed at Simla on a formula for Kashmir, that it would be a subject for bilateral negotiations with India. We don't intend to heat up the situation over Kashmir but now Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has worked out a settlement with SHEIKH <persName corresp="p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> and we understand it will be announced soon. Maybe even while I am here. There will be some re action in Pakistan, but it will be controlled. The Indians shouldn't say that we are heating it up. They do these things and then say we're heating it up.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: It would help us on the arms question if you could make some motion on the Simla process. I don't know what moves may be possible but maybe there is something that you could do.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: We have done many things. We have signed the trade agreement. I do not know what is left that we can do.</p>
                        <p>AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">BYROADE</persName>: The Pakistanis are ready to resume diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have a message to give you from the Bangladesh Government. They are prepared for discussions without preconditions. They wanted me to convey it to you.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d189-08" facs="d189-08"/>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Thank you. We are happy to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Were you surprised by the changes in Bangladesh?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: No.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: My estimate is that MUJIB's talents lie in oratory rather than government. In 1971 I predicted that Bangladesh would be an international basket case.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Bangladesh is poverty and poetry. Mujib gives the poetry and the people have the poverty. But this has been no surprise.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Can Mujib last?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: I doubt it.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What happens then? The Army?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes, and they will turn increasingly anti-Indian.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: After my trip to South Asia last October, the head of my policy planning staff said after he had seen India we should give nuclear weapons to both Pakistan and Bangladesh. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>: I told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AMH2">Ali</persName> [the Bangladesh Ambassador] here the other day that Pakistan and Bangladesh are natural allies.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: It would have been so much better if we had been a confederation from the start.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>: And if they had had more autonomy.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Will the Bengalees turn against India?</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: There are anti-Indian sentiments now. There are problems over smuggling. Bangladesh produces jute and tea, the same things India exports. They are competing in international markets. The Chinese have not recognized Bangladesh yet.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: They will do so.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: They asked us about it and we requested that they hold back. It was during the period while <persName corresp="#p_DM6">Daoud</persName>'s <pb n="9" xml:id="d189-09" facs="d189-09"/>brother <persName corresp="#p_NMA2">Naim</persName> was going to Peking and I was off to Moscow. It did not seem a good time and they held up on that score, but they will do it.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You have to go to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sparkman will probably call you Prime Minister WILSON. Our Chairman is a little advanced in years and he is out of focus at the end of the day. In some ways Fulbright was better for us than Sparkman. He was very intelligent. Sparkman will sign any harassing letter to me that his staff prepares.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: Has Fulbright gone to London?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: No, Fulbright turned it down. Eliot Richardson is going to London. It has already been announced in the press that it is a training ground for my job. But he'll have to deal with <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> to get it. I always tell the Syrians that I bring <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> with me on my Middle East trips so that he won't plan a coup while I am gone. The Syrians know it is a joke, but at the same time in their own context it is still plausible. You didn't bring my favorite child here with you.</p>
                        <p>PRIME MINISTER: No, she is in London studying at Oxford.</p>
                        <p>[The Secretary then said his farewells and the meeting ended at approximately 3:30.]</p>

I AM CONVEYING HERE THE FOREIGN SECRETARY'S SPECIAL REQUEST, MADE FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND SEVERAL OF HIS CABINET COLLEAGUES, WHETHER IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE US DECISION TO BE DEFERRED AND MADE AFTER THE FOREIGN MINISTER'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON IN MARCH 13-14.</item>

IN FACT, <persName corresp="#p_SK2">KEWAL SINGH</persName> SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN SPECULATING ONLY YESTERDAY THAT WE WOULD NOT MAKE A DECISION BEFORE THEN UNLESS WE INTENDED TO DAMAGE INDIA-US RELATIONS. NE NOTED IMMEDIATELY THE UNFORTUNATE COINCIDENCE OF THE DATE OF OUR ANNOUNCEMENT AND THAT OF THE PRESENTATION OF AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">SAXBE</persName>'S CREDENTIALS (THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> MOVED UP THE DATE TO FEBRUARY 24 ONLY TWO DAYS AGO SO THAT <pb n="2" xml:id="d190-02" facs="d190-02"/>THERE WOULD THE LEAST POSSIBLE DELAY AFTER THE AMBASSADOR'S ARRIVAL).</item>

INDIAN REACTION TO OUR DECISION IS CERTAIN TO BE STRONG—IT ALREADY IS. IF WE PROCEED ON OUR SCHEDULE IT WILL BE COLORED BY THIS FURTHER PERSONAL ELEMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, A DELAY UNTIL AFTER THE <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> VISIT WOULD GIVE US A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS DECISION NEED NOT HARM INDIAN INTERESTS OR INDIA-US RELATIONS AND WOULD BE A GESTURE OF RESPECT TO CHAVAN, WHO WAS PERSONALLY EXTREMELY PROUD OF HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU LAST OCTOBER, AND HIS GOVERNMENT.</item>

                        <p>Indian Reaction to the Arms Supply Decision - <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> Postpones Visit</p>
                        <p>Official Indian reaction in Delhi to our February 24 announcement on arms policy became somewhat sharper on February 26. The Indians have informed us that External Affairs Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> was postponing his visit to Washington for the Joint Commission meeting scheduled March 13-14.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> also made some brief but critical remarks about the new U.S. policy in the Indian Upper House. She said the U.S. decision would “reopen old wounds and hinder the process of healing and normalization (with Pakistan) for which we have worked so persistently”. It showed that the “policy makers of that great country continued to subscribe to the fallacy of equating Pakistan and India. It is a policy that has caused tension in the Subcontinent.” With apparent reference to things the Pakistanis have said, she also declared it “dishonest” to assert India's nuclear program posed a danger to Pakistan and “specious” to argue Pakistan needs arms because India is developing self-sufficiency in defense production.</p>
                        <p>Indian press reactions February 26 prominently covered <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>'s remarks, your response, and <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>'s statement. Editorial comment was relatively balanced. The Times of India commented “In all fairness it cannot be said that the U.S. decision will gravely upset the status quo in the Subcontinent”. The Hindustan Times warned against “hysterical denunciations or any cancellation of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>'s projected visit to Washington”.</p>

                        <p>WE BOTH SEEK.</p>
                        <p>THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR THE SALE UNDER TITLE I OF PUBLIC LAW 480 OF 800,000 TONS OF WHEAT — A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLY TO INDIA THIS FISCAL YEAR. THE SALE IS BEING FINANCED BY A LONG-TERM LOW-INTEREST LOAN AND PAYMENT WILL BE MADE IN DOLLARS.</p>
                        <p>I WANT TO OFFER A SPECIAL WORD OF THANKS TO THOSE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES WHO WORKED SO HARD TO BRING THESE NEGOTIATIONS TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION.</p>
                        <p>IN NEW DELHI LAST OCTOBER, SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> STATED THAT “THE INTERESTS OF INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE COMPATIBLE, AND WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING OF COOPERATION WHOSE POSSIBILITIES HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO BE EXPLOITED.” TODAY'S AGREEMENT SHOULD BE SEEN IN THAT CONTEXT. I AM HONORED TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A PART.</p>
                        <p>3. TEXT OF USDA PRESS LEASE (RELEASED TO PRESS AFTER CEREMONY): SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE EARL L. BUTZ TODAY ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING IN WASHINGTON OF A PUBLIC LAW 480 TITLE I CONVERTIBLE LOCAL CURRENCY CREDIT SALES AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA PROVIDING FOR THE SALE OF $128 MILLION WORTH OF WHEAT/WHEAT FLOUR ON A GRAIN BASIS (ABOUT 800,000 METRIC TONS). THIS IS THE FIRST PL 480 AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH INDIA SINCE 1971.</p>
                        <p>“INDIA IS A VALUABLE CUSTOMER AND A FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES,” SECRETARY BUTZ SAID, “AND I AM PLEASED THAT AMERICAN AGRICULTURE IS IN A POSITION TO ASSIST INDIA IN MEETING ITS CURRENT FOOD REQUIREMENTS.”</p>
                        <p>INDIA HAS BEEN FACED WITH INCREASED IMPORT REQUIREMENTS OF GRAIN AS A RESULT OF POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS IN ITS CROP PRODUCING REGIONS. AT THE RECENT WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE IN ROME, INDIA WAS LISTED AS ONE OF THE 32 NATIONS “MOST SERIOUSLY AFFECTED (MSA)” BY SHORTAGES. INDIA HAD PURCHASED ABOUT 4.5 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN COMMERCIALLY FROM THE UNITED STATES SINCE LAST YEAR.</p>

                        <p>THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ANNOUNCED DURING NEGOTIATION OF THE AGREEMENT THAT IT WOULD USE THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF WHEAT/WHEAT FLOUR TO HELP IMPROVE THE AGRICULTURAL SITUATION IN INDIA.</p>

                        <p>WILL BE IN DOLLARS.</p>

                        <p>A: $128 MILLION</p>

                        <p>A: WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DETERMINED TO DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ASSIST INDIA IN OVERCOMING ITS FOOD SHORTAGES. THE 300,000 TONS FIGURE WAS A PRELIMINARY ONE, BASED ON EARLIER ESTIMATES OF WHAT WAS POSSIBLE, GIVEN SUPPLY AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINS. WE FOUND WE COULD DO MORE, AND DID SO.</p>
                        <p>Q: IS 800,000 TONS ALL THAT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR INDIA IN <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75?</p>
                        <p>A: UNDER TITLE I, YES. HOWEVER, UNDER TITLE II, WE ARE PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL 243,000 TONS OF FOOD IN THIS FISCAL YEAR. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF COMMODITIES SUPPLIED UNDER BOTH TITLES APPROXIMATES $200,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Q: IS THE DECISION TO INCREASE FOOD AID TO INDIA RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE RECENT CHANGE IN OUR ARMS POLICY IN SOUTH ASIA?</p>
                        <p>A: NO. AS I STATED EARLIER, WE HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO ALL WE COULD TO HELP INDIA OVERCOME ITS FOOD SHORTAGES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR TITLE II PROGRAM ENABLES U.S. VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS TO DISTRIBUTE FOOD IN INDIA UNDER INDIA'S CHILD-FEEDING PROGRAM.</p>
                        <p>Q: DOES THE U.S. PLAN TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FOOD AID TO INDIA NEXT YEAR?</p>
                        <p>A: WE HAVE MADE NO COMMITMENTS, BUT IF INDIA NEEDS AND REQUESTS ADDITIONAL FOOD AID, WE WOULD CONSIDER SUCH A REQUEST. THE FINAL DECISION WOULD DEPEND ON BUDGET-ARY AND SUPPLY CONSIDERATIONS, AND THE NEED FOR PL 480 FOOD IN OTHER COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>Q: AT ONE POINT I HEARD THE U.S. WOULD PROVIDE ONE MILLION TONS OF FOOD UNDER TITLE I THIS YEAR. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT FIGURE? A: WE HAVE NEVER ANNOUNCED A FIGURE HIGHER THAN 300,000</p>

                        <p>TONS. WE MADE A DECISION EARLIER THIS YEAR TO SUPPLY 300,000 TONS AND TO REVIEW THE SITUATION OVER TIME TO SEE WHAT MORE COULD BE DONE. WE FOUND WE COULD SUPPLY 800,000 TONS UNDER TITLE I (GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CONCESSIONAL SALES). NOTE THAT I HAVE SAID WE ARE ALSO SUPPLYING 243,000 TONS OF FOOD UNDER TITLE II (GRANTS TO U.S. VOLUNTARY AGENCIES OPERATING IN INDIA).</p>
                        <p>Q: HOW MUCH FOOD HAS INDIA BOUGHT COMMERCIALLY IN THE U.S. SINCE LAST SUMMER?</p>
                        <p>A: ABOUT 4.5 MILLION TONS OF FOODGRAIN. I UNDERSTAND INDIA WAS THE LARGEST FOREIGN COMMERICAL PURCHASER OF U.S. WHEAT.</p>
                        <p>Q: CAN ANY OF THIS FOOD BE RE-EXPORTED TO THE SOVIET UNION TO REPAY INDIAN COMMITMENTS TO MOSCOW?</p>
                        <p>A: NO. THE FOOD WILL BE CONSUMED ENTIRELY WITHIN INDIA.</p>

                        <p>As reflected in the public announcement of February 24, 1975, I have decided to lift the embargo on US sales of lethal military equipment to Pakistan and India. The US Government, subject to the guidelines below, should in the future be as responsive as possible to requests for the sale of defense articles and services which will meet the legitimate security needs for modern and effective forces in Pakistan and India.</p>
                        <p>Sales will be subject to the following guidelines:
<list>
                                <item>— Sales of US military equipment to Pakistan and India will be on a cash basis only. There will be no grant military assistance or <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credits for the purchase of military equipment by either Pakistan or India.</item>
                                <item>— All sales of military equipment will be reviewed on a case by case basis.</item>
                                <item>— All sales will be consistent with the overall US policy in South Asia to encourage the process of normalization and reconciliation between Pakistan and India. Sales should not stimulate an arms race in that region or restore the pre-1965 situation in which the US was a major regional arms supplier.</item>
                                <item>— At least in the initial stages, the emphasis should be on weapons and equipment which clearly enhance defensive capabilities.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d193-02" facs="d193-02"/>
                        <p>These guidelines as set forth above should also apply to any requests for the transfer of US-controlled military equipment from third countries to Pakistan or India.</p>
                        <p>In order to assist in the implementation of this decision in the initial stages, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council staff, shall be responsible for ensuring that each request received under this policy is reviewed and decided upon in accordance with the above guidelines and in full compliance with legal and congressional requirements. Requests with potential for major political or military impact should be referred to me for consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible for monitoring arms shipments to Pakistan and India from all sources on a continuing basis. A report summarizing such shipments and providing an assessment of the prospective military capabilities, including nuclear capability as appropriate, should be prepared for my attention semi-annually on June 30 and December 30 of each year.</p>

                            <item>I HAVE NOW COMPLETED THE INITIAL FORMALITIES EXPECTED OF AN AMBASSADOR HERE AND CAN REPORT THAT WHILE MY RECEPTION HAS BEEN WARM AND CORRECT, THE INDIANS ARE NOT TAKING PARTICULARLY GOOD CARE OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE US THESE DAYS.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>NEEDLESS TO SAY, I COULD HAVE ARRIVED IN INDIA AT A BETTER TIME (I AGREE THAT IT WAS BEST THAT I WAIT OUT THE EARLY FIREWORKS IN BANGKOK). NEVERTHELESS, WITH THE PRESS CORPS LOOKING ON, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA VERY CAREFULLY ARRANGED MY PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS AND FIRST CALLS SO THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR SPECULATION THAT I WAS KEPT WAITING. I DELIBERATELY DECIDED TO AVOID DOING MUCH BUSINESS DURING MY TALKS WITH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY, THE DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER, THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND THE PRIME MINISTER. ONE OR TWO THINGS WERE OF SIGNIFICANCE, HOWEVER. WHEN I TALKED TO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ON MARCH 5, I MENTIONED THE CONTROVERSY OVER INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE US AND SAID THAT THESE WERE BEING BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL. WITH INDIA IN MIND HE SAID THAT IT COULD HAPPEN THAT SOMETHING COULD BE DONE WHICH WAS NOT AUTHORIZED. I TOLD HIM THAT I INTENDED TO WATCH OVER ALL US ACTIVITIES IN INDIA AND CATEGORICALLY ASSURED HIM THAT THERE WOULD <pb n="2" xml:id="d194-02" facs="d194-02"/>BE NO US INTERFERENCE IN INDIAN AFFAIRS. (I CERTAINLY DON'T EXPECT THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST US TO STOP BUT I DO INTEND CAREFULLY TO SUPERVISE OUR ACTIVITIES HERE AND HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TO AVOID AROUSING SUSPICIONS BY UNNECESSARY TRAVEL.)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>ONE ASPECT OF MY CONVERSATION WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER ON APRIL 1 ILLUSTRATES WHAT I MEAN BY THE INDIANS NOT TAKING MUCH CARE OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH US. MAKING CONVERSATION, I SAID THAT I WAS PLEASED THAT THE PL 480 AGREEMENT HAD BEEN COMPLETED. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> WAS NOT EVEN AWARE OF THIS AND HAD TO ASK HIS MAN TEJA WHAT HAD HAPPENED. (THE INDIANS IN WASHINGTON TOLD US THAT THEY WOULD ISSUE A PRESS RELEASE IN NEW DELHI. THEY DIDN'T AND THE SIGNING DIDN'T GET MUCH ATTENTION IN THE PAPERS HERE AS USUAL THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE NEGOTIATIONS GOT MUCH MORE.)</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>AS I HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, THE PRIME MINISTER SEEMED UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY (THE MOST IN MY VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH HER). THERE WERE STILL THE LONG SILENCES. IT IS A CURIOUS GOVERNMENT IN WHICH NEITHER THE PRIME MINISTER NOR THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAY MUCH TO REPRESENTATIVES FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID SO FAR THAT MY OFFICIAL CONVERSATIONS HAVE DONE LITTLE TO GIVE ME A FEEL FOR THE SITUATION OUT HERE, BUT I HAVE, IN THE COURSE OF THE ORDINARY THINGS A NEW AMBASSADOR DOES, INCLUDING MY FIRST OFFICIAL VISITS TO BOMBAY AND MADRAS, DONE A LOT OF LISTENING TO INDIANS AND DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES. ALSO INDIA'S REMARKABLY FREE PRESS IS REVEALING. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HERE WANTS TO PRESERVE A BASIS FOR A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US WHICH WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR IT TO GET THE THINGS FROM US IT WANTS, IT ISNT WORKING VERY HARD AT IT. IT IS TRUE THAT THE INDIANS MAY HAVE MADE SOME EFFORT TO CONTAIN THEIR REACTION TO OUR ARMS SALES POLICY, BUT I DISAGREE WITH WASHINGTON THAT THEIR REACTION HAS BEEN MODERATE. I BELIEVE THAT WASHINGTON MAY ALSO UNDERESTIMATE THE INTENSITY AND SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR CONCERN OVER THE POLICY. ANOTHER <pb n="3" xml:id="d194-03" facs="d194-03"/>THING WHICH I HAVE NOTICED IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE INDIANS CONTINUE TO JOIN UP WITH THE RADICAL NONALIGNED AND IN THE PROCESS TAKE ISSUE WITH US. WHETHER AT HAVANA OR LIMA, THEY PREACH AN INTERNATIONAL SHARE THE WEALTH DOCTRINE WHICH WOULD DESTROY US ALL. I HOPE TO GOD THE EGYPTIANS DO NOT GET THEM INVOLVED IN THE GENEVA TALKS ON PALESTINE.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>GIVEN ALL OF THIS, I THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT I START OUT HERE ON THE RIGHT FOOT. I COULD NOT POSSIBLY ACCEPT THIS DISREGARD FOR US INTERESTS. CONSEQUENTLY, WHEN I HAVE HAD OFFICIAL TALKS, I HAVE STUCK CAREFULLY TO PROTOCOL AND AVOIDED BUSINESS: OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN UNPLEASANT. I HAVE DELIBERATELY SPOKEN QUITE FRANKLY TO THE PRESS IN ORDER TO GET GREATER REALISM INTO OUR RELATIONS. I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR I WAS NOT HERE TO IMPROVE THE CLIMATE OF RELATIONS: I WAS HERE REPRESENT MY GOVERNMENT. I HAVE SAID THAT GOOD RELATIONS WERE A TWO-WAY STREET AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE INITIATIVE WAS THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT HERE. I ALSO POINTED OUT THAT INDIA PAYS IN THE US FOR ITS RADICAL ACTIONS WITH THE NONALIGNED (RECOGNITION OF THE PLO). IN SAYING SUCH THINGS, I HAVE TAKEN SOME HEAT IN THE PRESS AND FROM LEFTIST POLITICIANS. I EXPECTED THIS AND TAKE IT AS EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARD.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>ANOTHER IMPRESSION WHICH MAY BE WORTH REPORTING IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE US IS BLAMED FOR INDIA'S AND THE WORLD'S ILLS. THERE IS A FASCINATION WITH THE US IN INDIA AND OUR DIFFICULTIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE REPORTED IN DETAIL AND FREQUENTLY WITH SATISFACTION. THE CHORUS ON THE <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> HAS BUILT UP AGAIN AND WE ARE ACCUSED OF EVERYTHING FROM PLOTTING THE MURDER OF INDIAN OFFICIALS TO SUPPORTING JAYAPRAKASH NARAYAN IN HIS AGITATION AGAINST MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>. IN FAIRNESS, MOST OF THIS COMES FROM THE IRRESPONSIBLE PAPERS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS BUT ON OCCASION A STATE POLITICAL LEADER OR A CONGRESS PARTY OFFICIAL CHIMES IN. THIS WILL PROBABLY INCREASE UNTIL MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> HOLDS ELECTIONS IN THE NEXT 8-12 MONTHS.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>ALL OF THIS CONVINCES ME THAT LIFE IS GOING TO BE <pb n="4" xml:id="d194-04" facs="d194-04"/>SLOW IN NEW DELHI FOR A WHILE. I DON'T INTEND ANY INITIATIVES TO SPEED IT UP: THAT IS FOR THE INDIANS. I AM QUITE PREPARED TO TAKE IT EASY FOR A WHILE.</item>

                        <p>1. TWO WEEKS AGO I REPORTED THAT THE INDIANS DID NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING VERY HARDAT THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE US. I CONTINUE TO GET EVIDENCE WHICH SUPPORTS THIS CONCLUSION. IN A FORMAL DEBATE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN THE PARLIAMENT ON APRIL 16 <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> DISTORTED OUR ARMS POLICY BY ATTACKING US FOR CREATING A BALANCE OF POWER THROUGH ARMS SUPPLY. HE SAID THAT INDIA'S RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND THE US SHOULD NOT BE EQUATED BECAUSE THE SOVIET UNION STOOD BY INDIA IN TIME OF CRISIS. THE FUTURE OF INDO-US RELATIONS, ACCORDING TO <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName>, DEPENDED UPON OUR ACCEPTING INDIAN SENSITIVITIES. (SEE NEW DELHI 5121 FOR DETAILS.)</p>
                        <p>2. AT THE SAME GENERAL TIME <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> WAS SAYING THIS, MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>, DEFENSE MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName>, THE HOME MINISTER, AND A COUPLE OF STATE CHIEF MINISTERS PUT THE US TO USE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IN QUITE AN UNACCEPTABLE WAY. THEY ALL OPPOSED OPPOSITION DEMANDS FOR THE END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN EFFECT SINCE THE 1971 WAR ON THE GROUNDS OF US ARMS TO PAKISTAN, THE “FEVERISH ARMS BUILD-UP” IN THE REGION, AND THE THREAT OF AGRESSION FROM THE SEA FROM SOME UNNAMED SEA POWER.</p>

                        <p>INDICATIVE OF THE STATE OF OUR RELATIONS OUT HERE IS THAT ANYONE HEARING SUCH REMARKS UNDERSTANDS THAT THEY ALL REFER TO THE US. (SEE NEW DELHI 5200.)</p>
                        <p>3. SINCE THE INDIANS DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ON THE ROAD TO A MATURE RELATIONSHIP, XI TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE INDIAN DINNER FOR SECRETARY SIMON TO SPEAK PRIVATELY TO BOTH P.N. DHAR, MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S PRIVATE SECRETARY, AND G. PARTHASARATHY, THE SENIOR OFFICIAL PRESENT FROM THE FOREIGN MINISTRY. I NOTED THE NEW OFFICIAL INDIAN LINE ON THE US AND SAID THAT WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T APPRECIATE BEING CLASSED AS A BELLIGERENT, NOR DID WE ENJOY THE DAILY ABUSE WE WERE TAKING. WHAT DID THEY WANT, THAT THE US GET COMPLETELY OUT OF INDIA? <persName corresp="#p_DDP2">DHAR</persName> AND PARTHASARATHY DID NOT DENY THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> LINE (ALTHOUGH DHAR LAMELY CLAIMED THAT MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> COULDN'T HAVE MEANT THE US WHEN SHE SPOKE OF THE NAVAL THREAT) AND ONLY ADVISED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THINGS QUIETED DOWN. THEY EXPLAINED THAT I SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE SHOCK WHICH OUR ARMS DECISION HAD CAUSED IN INDIA.</p>
                        <p>4. I HAVE NOT BEEN EKNCOURAGED BY THIS LATEST EXCHANGE AND DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH INDIA WHILE WE ARE BEING ACCUSED OF BEING A THREAT TO IT. IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THE INDIANS HAVE MADE A DECISION THAT WE ARE MORE USEFUL TO THEM AS A FOE TO BE USED IN THEIR POLITICAL BATTLES THAN AS A FRIEND WHO COULD HELP IN PERHAPS LESS IMMEDIATE WAYS. OF COURSE, THEY WOULD LIKE TO USE US FOR BOTH, BUT I HAVE BY DOUBTS ABOUT PER-MITTING THIS.</p>
                        <p>5. I AM SADDENED BY ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THIS TURN FOR THE WORSE WILL ENDURE FOR SOME TIME AND BECAUSE I AM CONVINCED IT IS THE RESUL OF OUR ARMS DECISION. THE INDIANS HAVE MISREAD OUR POLICY AND CERTANILY ARE NOT BEHAVING RATIONALLY. BUT XTHIS HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE WHICH PROMPTED RATIONALITY. WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THAT AFTER THE SHOCK OF THE ARMS POLICY CHANGE, THE INDIANS MAY HAVE LOOKED AROUND AT OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONS AND FOUND THEM SO THIN THAT THEY SAW LITTLE INCENTIVE TO LOOK AFTER THEIR RELATIONS WITH US. AND THE PROSPECT OF MORE FOOD NEXT YEAR WILL NOT ALTER THE</p>

                        <p>6 I INTEND TO CONTINUE MAKING INDIAN OFFICIALS AWARE OF HOW WE FEEL ABOUT THEIR ATTACKS AND WHAT THEIR EFFECT WILL BE ON OUR RELATIONS. I WILL SPEAK TO <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> ABOUT IT THE NEXT CHANCE I GET.</p>

                        <p>1. WE TOO HAVE BEEN DISTURBED BY RECENT INCREASE IN PUBLIC CRITICISM OF U.S. BY MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName>, AND OTHERS. IN FACT, WHEN <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss> ARRIVED HERE WE WERE IN PROCESS OF DRAFTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU TO RESPOND IN WAY YOU ALREADY HAVE WITH DHAR AND PARTHASARATHY. WE COMMEND YOUR TAKING THE INITIATIVE AND YOUR INTENTION TO RAISE PROBLEM WITH <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName>. WHEN YOU SEE HIM, THINK YOU COULD USEFULLY DRAW ON FOLLOWING IN ADDITION TO POINTS YOU MADE IN <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>— ONE PREMISE OF MATURE RELATIONSHIP WHICH WE SUPPOSEDLY ARE SEEKING IS MUTUAL RESTRAINT IN CRITICISM OF EACH OTHER AND WILLINGNESS TO USE PRIVATE GOVERNMENT</p>

                        <p>TO GOVERNMENT CHANNELS TO SORT OUR PROBLEMS RATHER THAN RESORTING TO PUBLIC NAME-CALLING.</p>
                        <p>— WE CAN APPRECIATE INDIAN CONCERNS ON LIFTING OF THE ARMS EMBARGO, EVEN IF WE DO NOT AGREE WITH INDIAN VIEWPOINT, AND WE RECOGNIZE GENUINE PUBLIC SENTIMENT THAT EXISTS IN INDIA ON THIS ISSUE. ON OTHER HAND, WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR APPRECIATE RECENT WAVE OF PUBLIC CRITICISM OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> BY INDIAN LEADERS, PARTICULARLY IMPLICATION THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> REPRESENTS “SEA THREAT” TO INDIA.</p>
                        <p>— U.S. HAS REFRAINED FROM PUBLIC CRITICISM OF INDIA OVER HANDLING OF SIKKIM AFFAIR AS WE APPRECIATE INDIAN SENSITIVITIES ON THIS SCORE AND HAVE NO DESIRE TO FURTHER DAMAGE INDIAN IMAGE IN U.S. RECENT SPEECHES INDICATE SIMILAR RESTRAINT ON INDIAN SIDE SEEMS TO BE LACKING.</p>
                        <p>— AS WE HAVE REPEATEDLY STATED, MOST RECENTLY BY SECRETARY SIMON IN HIS APRIL 18 BOMBAY SPEECH, U.S. WANTS GOOD RELATIONS WITH INDIA. HOWEVER, THIS HAS TO BE 2-WAY STREET. IT IS FOR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> TO DECIDE IF IT WISHES TO CREATE PUBLIC CLIMATE THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR U.S. TO HAVE MATURE AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH INDIA BY USING US AS DOMESTIC POLITICAL WHIPPING BOY. WE WOULD HOPE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WOULD DESIST FROM SUCH AN APPROACH, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT INDO-U.S. RELATIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. COMMENT. OUR EXPERIENCE IN PAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS BEEN THAT INDIANS MAY TONE DOWN OR DROP ATTACKS IF WE TAKE TOUGH LINE. FOR REASONS YOU CITE THIS APPROACH MAY PROVE LESS EFFECTIVE AT PRESENT TIME, BUT NONETHELESS WE THINK IT WORTHWHILE TO TRY TO PUT STOPPER ON THESE ATTACKS BEFORE THEY BECOME PART OF ELECTION CAMPAIGN RHETORIC.</p>

                        <p>INDIAN CHARGES SUCH AS BAROOAH'S THAT U.S. ARMS SUPPLIES TO PAKISTAN CREATING TENSION IN SUBCONTINENT, YOU SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT INTEMPERATE INDIAN STATEMENTS ON THIS SCORE CAN BECOME SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY. IN REALITY, THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> HAS NOT YET REQUESTED ANY NEW ARMS FROM US AND WE INTEND TO REVIEW EACH REQUEST CAREFULLY IN LIGHT OF OUR ANNOUNCED POLICY GUIDELINES. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ARE AWARE THATGOI AND USSR ARE IN PROCESS OF CONCLUDING MAJOR RPT MAJOR NEW ARMS DEAL (STRICTLY FYI, <gloss target="#t_NOFORN1">NOFORN</gloss>: ACCORDING TO OUR INTELLIGENCE, ON ORDER OF U.S. 200-500 MILLION DOLLARS END FYI). IT IS HYPOCRISY FOR <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> TO CRY WOLF UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
                        <p>3. YOU SHOULD ALSO STATE THAT HIGHEST LEVELS OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WANT GOI CLEARLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT RELATIONS CANNOT BE ONE-WAY STREET. CONTINUED LACK OF RESTRAINT ON PUBLIC STATEMENTS WILL INEVITABLY TRIGGER NEW DOWNWARD SPIRAL IN INDO-U.S. RELATIONS. WE WOULD LIKE TO AVOID THIS, BUT DECISION IS UP TO INDIANS.</p>
                        <p>4. FINALLY, YOU SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT RPT NOT SAYING WE EXPECT INDIA TO AGREE WITH US ON ALL ISSUES, ANYMORE THAN WE WILL AGREE ON MANY ISSUES WITH INDIA. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT PUBLIC AIRING OF DISAGREEMENTS AND CRITICISMS IN SO OFFENSIVE A MANNER IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE KIND OF NEW MATURE RELATIONSHIP WE THOUGHT OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS HAD AGREED WE WOULD PURSUE.</p>

                            <item>I HAVE A MESSAGE FROM JOE SISCO TELLING ME TO SPEAK STRONGLY TO <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> ABOUT RECENT INDIAN CRITICISMS OF THE US. I DON'T BELIEVE HOWEVER, THAT I SHOULD START THIS PROCESS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT OUR STRATEGY IS. THAT IS, WHAT WOULD WE DO IF THE INDIANS DID NOT RESPOND? I FEAR THAT THE INDIANS CONTINUE TO ABUSE US BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THEIR EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT WE WILL TAKE IT AND CONTINUE TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>IN FACT, WE WARNED THEM SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT IF THEY OVERREACTED TO OUR ARMS SALES POLICY WE WOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT OUR POLICIES. AT FIRST IT APPEARED THAT THEY HAD HEEDED THIS WARNING, BUT IT IS NOW OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE NOT. AT THIS TIME I FEEL I NEED A CLEAR IDEA OF WHERE WE ARE GOING BEFORE DELIVERING ANOTHER LECTURE.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>ACTIONS UNDER WAY WITHIN THE US GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE THE INDIANS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HELP THEM DESPITE THEIR CRITICISM. VERY SHORTLY THE ADMINISTRATION WILL GO TO THE HILL WITH AN AID APPROPRIATION <pb n="2" xml:id="d198-02" facs="d198-02"/>WHICH WILL INCLUDE A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR AID PROGRAM FOR INDIA. OUR PRESENTATION TO THE CONGRESS WILL ALSO INDICATE WE TENTATIVELY PLAN ON ANOTHER 800,000 TONS OF WHEAT UNDER TITLE I, AND I HAVE HEARD FROM VISITORS THAT US AND WORLD CROP PROSPECTS ARE SO GOOD THAT THOUGHT IS BEING GIVEN TO AN INDIAN PROGRAM OF UP TO FOUR MILLION TONS. IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE ENGAGED IN A VARIETY OF JOINT PROJECTS. OF THOSE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE JOINT COMMISSION, SOME ARE OF MUTUAL INTEREST BUT OTHERS ARE ONLY OF BENEFIT TO THE INDIANS. ANOTHER PROJECT WHICH WILL BE PARTICULARLY VISIBLE THIS SUMMER IS A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR EXPERIMENT IN EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION FOR WHICH WE ARE PROVIDING THE SATELLITE. I MIGHT ADD THAT ON THIS ONE THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE USED TO FURTHER THE INTEREST OF THE CONGRESS PARTY. FINALLY SECRETARY SIMON HAS JUST RENEWED YOUR INVITATION TO CHAVAN TO VISIT WASHINGTON, AND A VISIT BY THE PRESIDENT IS STILL SCHEDULED SOMETIME THIS YEAR.</item>

                            <item>ALL OF THESE ARE PUBLICLY KNOWN IN INDIA AND WILL CONVEY A MESSAGE OF THEIR OWN IF THEY CONTINUE WHILE THE US IS USED AS A POLITICAL SCAPEGOAT. I THINK YOU WILL AGREE THAT THERE WOULD BE LITTLE POINT IN MY SPEAKING TO CHAVAN AS INSTRUCTED IF THE BUREAUCRACY IN WASHINGTON PLANS TO CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF MY APPROACH.</item>

                            <item>THERE ARE SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES. ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO FRANKLY TELL THE FOREIGN MINISTER THAT UNLESS THERE IS A CHANGE, THE CLIMATE OF OUR RELATIONS WILL NOT SUPPORT THE COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS IN WHICH WE ARE ENGAGED. IF THERE IS NO RESPONSE WE WOULD MAKE SOME HIGHLY VISIBLE CHANGES IN THE PROGRAMS I HAVE DESCRIBED. UNDER A SECOND OPTION I COULD LIMIT MYSELF TO SPEAKING OF OUR CONCERNS, AS PROPOSED, AND IF THERE IS NO RESPONSE, REACT MORE MODERATELY: CUT BACK, BUT NOT OFF; LOWER OUR PROFILE EVEN MORE AND LIMIT OUR FOOD AID TO TITLE 2, WHATEVER THE AMOUNT; REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE PRESIDENTS VISIT. OR YOU COULD HOLD ME IN WASHINGTON AFTER MY CONSULTATION VISIT IN JUNE. THIS I DO NOT RELISH. A FINAL OPTION WOULD BE TO CONTINUE AS WE HAVE WITH THE KICK ME SIGN STILL ON OUR BACK.</item>

                        <p>SUMMARY: IN A MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> ON MAY 16, I REVIEWED THE LONG LIST OF INDIAN CRITICISMS OF THE US. WHILE I NOTED SOME IMPROVEMENT IN WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER WERE SAYING, OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CONGRESS PARTY OFFICIALS CONTINUED EXTREME AND UNWARRANTED CRITICISM OF THE US. I TOLD HIM THAT IF THE CRITICISM CONTINUES THE US WILL REVIEW ITS AGREEMENTS WITH INDIA. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> REPLIED THAT WHAT MATTERED WAS WHAT HE AND THE PRIME MINISTER SAID; I TOLD HIM THAT WASN'T THE WAY IT WORKED IN THE US GOVERNMENT. HE SAID THAT IN LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, HE THOUGHT THE US AND INDIA SHOULD NOW HAVE A FRIENDLY DIALOGUE. INDIA WANTED GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE US AND I SHOULD RETURN TO THE US WITH A “WARMER FEELING.” I BELIEVE WE MUST NOW WAIT TO SEE WHAT EFFECT MY PRESENTATION HAS AND ADJUST OUR RELATIONS WITH INDIA TO THE SITUATION WHICH EMERGES. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>I STARTED OUT BY TELLING <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> THAT I HAD AN UNPLEASANT TASK TO PERFORM: TO COMPLAIN ABOUT STATEMENTS CRITICIZING THE US WHICH HAD BEEN MADE BY INDIAN OFFICIALS, SOME AS RECENTLY AS THE PREVIOUS EVENING. (THE CONGRESS LEFT—CENTRAL MINISTERS, STATE CHIEF MINISTER, AND CONGRESS OFFICIALS HAD <pb n="2" xml:id="d200-02" facs="d200-02"/>HAD A FIELD DAY AT AN “ANTI-FASCIST CONFERENCE”.) I RECITED THE LIST: STATEMENTS REFERRING TO US AS FASCISTS, AS IMPERIALIST AGGRESSORS, AS A THREAT TO INDIA FROM THE SEA AND ATTACKS MADE ON US FOR HELPING INDIA WITH RESEARCH ON THE GENETIC CONTROL OF MOSQUITOS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE NOTED WITH APPROVAL RECENT STATEMENTS BY MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> AND <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> ABOUT INDIA'S DESIRE FOR FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE US. BUT, I POINTED OUT, TO HAVE A FRIEND, ONE MUST BE A FRIEND. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> HAD TOLD PARLIAMENT THAT THE US MUST HAVE RESPECT FOR INDIAN SENSIBILITIES. WE THINK THAT INDIAN MUST HAVE RESPECT FOR US SENSIBILITIES. AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> HAD CLAIMED THE INDIAN OFFICIALS HAD BEEN MISQUOTED; YET THERE HAD BEEN NO CLARIFICATIONS. <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> APPARENTLY HAD EVEN SAID THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR GOOD RELATIONS WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION (CHAVAN INTERRUPTED ME TO DENY THIS; I AM SENDING HIM AROUND THE CLIPPING). I TOLD <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> THAT I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> WAS ANY HELP IN THIS SITUATION.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>I THEN EMPHASIZED TWO POINTS TO CHAVAN. FIRST, I WAS AVAILABLE TO THE MINISTER AT ANY TIME IF THERE WAS ANY QUESTION HE HAD ABOUT US POLICY. IF INDIAN OFFICIALS WOULD COME TO US PRIVATELY, WE COULD WORK OUT AN ACCOMMODATION. IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THEY DID NOT LIKE, THEY SHOULD TELL US SO THAT WE COULD TRY TO CORRECT IT. I QUOTED WHAT CONGRESS PRESIDENT BARUA HAD SAID ABOUT US LAST NIGHT (“THE SAME POWERS WHO HAD WAGED WAR AGAINST INDOCHINA WERE NOW FOCUSING THEIR ATTENTION ON INDIA. THESE IMPERIALIST POWERS DO NOT WANT SOCIALISM AND DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY”) AND RENEWED OUR PLEDGE THAT IF ANY AMERICAN IS GUILTY OF INTERFERENCE IN ANY WAY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT, WE WOULD HAVE HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>SECOND, I SAID THAT MY INSTRUCTIONS WERE THAT IF THE CRITICISM OF THE US CONTINUES, WE WILL REVIEW ALL AGREEMENTS WITH INDIA, INCLUDING SUCH THINGS AS LANDING RIGHTS, EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND PL 480 (I SAID, “MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT PL 480”).</item>
                            <label>I</label>
                            <item>ALSO POINTED OUT THAT INDIA CRITICISMS WERE BEING REPORTED IN THE US PRESS. I FEARED THAT AMERICAN TOURISM IN INDIA WOULD <pb n="3" xml:id="d200-03" facs="d200-03"/>BE AFFECTED.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I WOUND UP MY PRESENTATION SAYING THE I DID NOT WANT TO BE BLAMED FOR THE COLLAPSE OF INDI-US RELATIONS; I DID NOT WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN. BUT I WAS CONCERNED. THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE US WAS VERY SENSITIVE; OUR POLICIES WERE BEING REVIEWED. THERE WAS NO TELLING WHAT THE EFFECT OF CRITICISMS ON US CONCLUSIONS MIGHT BE. SOME DAYS AGO SENATOR HUMPHREY, SPEAKING OF INDIA, HAD SAID THAT WE WOULD TAKE CRITICISM, BUT NOT ABUSE. SENATOR MANSFIELD SAID THAT THE US SHOULD GET OUT OF ASIA. THINGS COULD NOT BE SALVAGED. I TOLD HIM THAT WHEN I WAS IN WASHINGTON I WANTED TO ASK THE CONGRESS FOR SOME RUPEES TO SPEND TO BENEFIT INDIA BUT I FEARED THAT I WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME CONVINCING THE MEMBERSHIP.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> SEEMED SHAKEN BY WHAT I HAD HAD TO SAY AND DID NOT REPLY AT LENGTH. OBVIOUSLY ILL AT EASE, HE SAID THAT HE WAS GRATEFUL TO ME FOR SPEAKING ABOUT THESE THINGS. INDIA HAD MATTERS ABOUT WHICH IT HAD TO COMMENT FRANKLY; IT WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO AND WOULD EXPECT THE US TO DO SO SIMILARLY. INDIA WAS A DEMOCRACY LIKE THE US AND PEOPLE HAD THEIR OWN OPINIONS. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS SAID AT THE “CONFERENCE” THE PREVIOUS EVENING BUT WHAT MATTERED WAS WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID. HE REPEATED THIS IDEA LATER: WE SHOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE OTHERS, ONLY TO HIM AND THE PRIME MINISTER. I TOLD HIM US CABINET OFFICERS SPOKE ONLY FOR OFFICIAL POLICY. HE SAID THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAD GIVEN ITS ASSESSMENT OF EVENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. IT DID NOT WANT TO HURT THE US, BUT THIS WAS ITS VIEWS. INDIA WAS GETTING BLAMED FOR NOT SUPPORTING THE US.</item>

                            <item>IN THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWED SEVERAL THINGS OF INTEREST EMERGED. WHEN I MENTIONED OUR ARMS SALES POLICY AND THAT WE HAD NOT EVEN SOLD ANY ARMS TO PAKISTAN YET; <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> WAS AWARE OF THIS AND POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID THAT INDIA SHOULD WAIT AND SEE HOW OUR ARMS SALES POLICY IS CARRIED OUT. I MENTIONED HOW MANY ARMS FRANCE HAD SOLD TO PAKISTAN WITHOUT CRITICISM; <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> TOOK THE LINE THAT FRANCE WAS SIMPLY SEEKING COMMERCIAL SALES. INDIA EXPECTED MORE FROM THE US. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF SOUTHEAST ASIA AND SAID THAT IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS THERE, IT WAS HIS VIEW THAT INDIA AND THE US SHOULD NOW HAVE A FRIENDLY DIALOGUE. HE SAID THAT I SHOULD GO BACK TO THE US WITH THIS IDEA.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>I DIDN'T WANT TO PROLONG THE CONVERSATION AS I FELT THAT I HAD MADE MY POINT. I SUMMED UP THE SITUATION SAYING THAT I HATED TO SEE US-INDIA RELATIONS RISKED BY IRRESPONSIBLE TALK. WE WERE NOT FASCISTS, WE HAD NOT TRAINED SONGBIRDS TO SPY IN INDIA. THE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP WAS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE NOW; AND WE HAD BEEN CAREFUL WHAT WE HAD SAID ABOUT INDIA. WE HAD NOT SAID ANYTHING ABOUT SIKKIM AND WE HAD NOT CRITICIZED INDIA'S NUCLEAR TEST. IT WAS A RIDICULOUS SITUATION IN WHICH OUR RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION WERE BETTER THAN THOSE WITH INDIA. UNTIL MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> HAD SPOKEN ABOUT A WEEK AGO, I HAD NEVER HEARD THE US MENTIONED AS A FRIEND.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> CALLED ATTENTION TO THE RESTRAINT WHICH HE HAD EXERCISED WHEN HE HAD BEEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE US AT THE AIRPORT ON HIS RETURN TO INDIA ON THE PREVIOUS DAY (HE HAD BEEN <pb n="5" xml:id="d200-05" facs="d200-05"/>CAREFUL, AS HE ORDINARILY IS). HE SAID THAT WHEN I RETURNED TO THE US HE WANTED ME TO GO BACK WITH A WARMER FEELING. HE HAD TOLD THE INDIAN CHAIRMEN OF THE SUBCOMMISSIONS TO GET TO WORK; IF THE RESULTS WERE GOOD THEN THEY COULD SEE ABOUT THE COMMISSION MEETING IN WASHINGTON. INDIA WANTED FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE US. HE DID NOT WANT HARD FEELINGS. WHEN I STARTED TO LEAVE AFTER WE HAD TALKED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES, HE URGED ME TO STAY, SAYING HE HAD RESERVED TIME FOR A LONGER TALK. I NEVERTHELESS DEPARTED.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT CHAVAN WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE A SATISFACTORY ANSWER ON THE SPOT, AND, AS IS OBVIOUS, HE DID NOT. WE CANNOT ACCEPT A SITUATION IN WHICH WE LISTEN ONLY TO MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> AND <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> WHILE ANY OTHER MINISTER CAN SAY WHATEVER HE LIKES ABOUT US. IT WILL, NEVERTHELESS, BE AN IMPROVEMENT IF THE RESTRAINT BEING CURRENTLY EXERCISED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER CONTINUES. WE WILL SIMPLY HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE EFFECT OF MY PRESENTATION IS AND THEN ADJUST THE LEVEL OF OUR RELATIONS TO THE SITUATION WHICH EMERGES. I ALSO LEARNED NOTHING FROM <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName>'S BRIEF REFERENCE TO THE SUBCOMMISSION. HIS GOVERNMENT HAS APPARENTLY STILL MADE NO DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO PROCEED TO THE COMMISSION MEETING. IN FACT, <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> HAD LITTLE TO SAY, WAS FLUSTERED, BUT NOW HAS A GOOD DEAL TO THINK ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT WILL BE MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S REACTION WHICH IS IMPORTANT AND THAT IS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE.</item>

                        <p rend="center">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">I. DOMESTIC POLITICAL TRENDS</p>
                        <p>1. India is entering a new political phase. The euphoria of 1971-1972—derived from resounding government election victories, the decisive conflict with Pakistan, and bumper grain harvests—has dissipated dramatically. In coming years the Indian Government will have to cope not only with greater economic and political challenges but also with a new national skepticism toward political leadership.</p>
                        <p>Central Government Strengths and Weaknesses</p>
                        <p>2. The inherent strengths of the Indian political system have provided stability and continuity for over a generation. These strengths include a belief in the legitimacy of the present political system on the part of virtually all politically functional sectors of Indian society, the vast array of executive and emergency powers vested in the central government, and the support of the large and still apolitical military and security forces. Moreover, no other party or coalition can yet hope to match the ruling Congress Party's broad base of support or to challenge its control over all but the fringes of the ideological spectrum. Even though serious economic and social problems remain unresolved, the key groups—business, labor, rural landlords, press, and the military, bureaucratic,and academic establishments—continue to regard the Congress Party as the only available source of stable government. In addition, the combination of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s personal legitimacy, political skill, and control over both the government and the party has given her in recent years a position of unprecedented power and authority.</p>
                        <p>3. Despite these strengths, the Indian Government will continue to suffer from serious liabilities, some traditional and some relatively new. Because the fragmented opposition has not adequately represented various class, religious, and regional interests at the national level, dissidents both within and without the Congress will continue to find no recourse but protest and violence. Bureaucratic and political corruption has increased, gained wide publicity, and begun to erode the government's ability to purse economic and social programs and to undermine public confidence in the existing political system.</p>
                        <p>4. The concentration of power in Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s hands has proved a liability as well as an asset. Because all but the most routine decisions rest with her, the normally inefficient and indecisive administration has become, at times, virtually paralyzed by lack of guidance. In the past, regional political barons, other senior Congress leaders, and the considerable responsibilities vested in state governments insulated the central government and <pb n="8" xml:id="d201-08" facs="d201-08"/>the Prime Minister from the repercussions of policy failures. Since 1969, however, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has intimidated or eliminated most potential scapegoats and increasingly bypassed state governments to resolve local issues; she has thus left herself solely responsible for and exposed to the results of her actions.</p>
                        <p>5. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s concentration of power has also weakened the Congress Party and reduced the strength and stability which the party has traditionally provided the government. The party is now less capable of mobilizing support for government policies and for Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> personally.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Challenges</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. The economic stringencies India is likely to face in the next several years will aggravate the already high political tensions. The government will probably be able to provide at least minimum food requirements to key urban areas to prevent serious disorders among the most politically sensitive portions of the population. To do so, however, the government may have to resort to unpopular emergency measures. Economic conditions are also likely both to raise the frequency of strikes in key national production and service sectors and to reduce the government's tolerance and flexibility in dealing with them.</p>
                        <p>7. All these considerations point to the likelihood of larger and more frequent demonstrations against central and state governments. Future protests will be directed more specifically against sitting governments and their policies rather than the more general protests of the past over prices, wages, and border disputes. Moreover, endemic communal violence is likely to increase. With future disorders of such nature and dimensions, the government will more often react with force.</p>
                        <p>8. Growing public dissatisfaction over the Congress Party's performance has led to the organization of a mass movement and political coalition around JAYAPRAKASH NARAYAN, the 72 year-old veteran of India's independence struggle. By virtue of his stature, his moral and apolitical past, his adherence to Mahatma <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s non-violent tactics,and the support of most opposition parties, Narayan poses the most formidable challenge yet to the Congress Party and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> personally. He has articulated popular dissatisfaction and focused on the government's greatest vulnerabilities in a manner that no other political figure could hope to match.</p>
                        <p>9. At present, Narayan's support comes primarily from the urban middle class caste Hindus. He has yet to make inroads among the rural masses, the Muslims, and the scheduled castes which provide the crucial margins for Congress parliamentary majorities. Nor has he shown promise of being able to mediate the personal and ideological differences and resolve the competition over candidates on which previous opposition coalitions have foundered. In the unlikely event he were to accomplish both tasks, Narayan's movement would become the first national alternative to Congress rule. Given the overwhelming dominance of the Congress Party, however, the central political issue will remain one of that party's performance rather than whether it, or the present political system, should be replaced.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Government's Response</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. Particularly sensitive to the personal nature of Narayan's attacks and concerned that accommodation of his demands in Bihar would lead to similar movements elsewhere, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has confronted Narayan in a power struggle which she appears confident she will win. Her response to the 1974 railway strike also set a precedent for future government confrontations with labor in key national sectors. The spread or intensification of dissent is likely to reinforce her inclination to meet political challenges head-on. Yet because of the unique threat Narayan poses to her position and that of the Congress Party, she and other Congress leaders appear to be considering administrative, educational, and electoral changes—and they have begun to crack down on corruption.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Role of Military and Security Forces</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. The Prime Minister has had to rely increasingly on the police, the paramilitary forces, and <pb n="9" xml:id="d201-09" facs="d201-09"/>the intelligence apparatus to maintain civil order. She has increased the size and responsibilities of the police and paramilitary forces and expanded the scope of intelligence operations and surveillance of political figures and opposition parties. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has also ordered the military, on several occasions, to help restore law and order.</p>
                        <p>12. The military, as well as the security forces, are reliable instruments of power. Morale is good and the officer corps is loyal to the constitutional system. While a few high level officers have complained about the use of the Army to maintain civil order, there is little doubt that the officer corps, a highly nationalistic group, will continue to support the government's attempts to suppress those who seek to disrupt the political process or to dislocate the economy. Indeed, the Army's concern over the impact of port and rail strikes on its defense posture has led it to create a substantial capability to operate essential transportation services. The chances that the military would take an independent stand on political issues are remote.</p>

                        <p>13. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s leadership will prove crucial. Sensitive to criticism, autocratic, authoritarian and aloof, she is a brilliant political tactician. Although given at times to doubt and vacillation, she is usually confident, decisive and determined, and possessed of a broad popular appeal. During the next few years she is likely to retain the ability to act quickly and decisively.</p>
                        <p>14. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> can be expected to continue her emphasis on executive power at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches and to adopt increasingly authoritarian measures to repress political opposition and disorders. But because she must prepare for national elections by the spring of 1976, some new political initiatives are probable, although they are likely to be superficial rather than basic changes.</p>
                        <p>15. We believe that India's next national elections will return the Congress Party to power, but without its present overwhelming majority-361 out of 523 seats in the lower house. Because of the unprecedented role Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has played in government and party decisions, any significant election losses will be interpreted as a personal defeat for her. If the party, for example, were to lose 30-40 seats, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> would probably find it necessary to strengthen the party by giving more authority to regional and local leaders, thus limiting her own independence of action. Should Congress lose 70-80 seats, comparable to its losses in 1967, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> would probably be forced to share real power with regional and factional leaders. In such a weakened position, it is unlikely that she would be allowed to retain the emergency powers she has had. She would find it more difficult to manage divisions in the party, and defections at the state levels would probably lead to instability in many state governments. In the unlikely event that Congress were to lose its majority, a coalition government would probably be formed around the Congress core, but Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> probably would not maintain the Prime Ministership for long.</p>
                        <p>16. In the event of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s death, her political power would be suddenly and widely dispersed. She would probably be succeeded at least initially by a senior cabinet officer, perhaps Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Y. B. Chavan</persName>, but the party would probably revert to collegial rule similar to that of the “syndicate” following Nehru's death. It might be at least several years before a new generation of leadership would emerge and party cohesion be restored. In the absence of strong central leadership, the states would renew pressure for greater control over their own political affairs. Should the Congress Party face elections in the absence of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, severe losses, perhaps reducing the Congress seats to less than a majority, would be likely.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>17. With the world's second largest population and tenth largest economy, India is also one of the poorest of nations. About 80 percent of its people live in the countryside, mainly as subsistence farmers. India is caught in a neo-Malthusian box where increases in the production of food and other essentials are closely matched, and in some years exceeded, by increases in population. The mismatch <pb n="10" xml:id="d201-10" facs="d201-10"/>of its vast population and relatively small capital base will not be quickly overcome even with the best economic management.</p>
                        <p>18. The Indian economy has been mismanaged at the top, and economic growth has frequently been sacrificed for socialistic and political goals. India has not fully utilized its land, water, mineral, and human resources and has overemphasized industrial development at the expense of agriculture, which is still key to India's growth. Development has been hindered by a variety of social factors, by disordered government priorities, and by extensive controls on the private sector. One of India's most serious problems is its ponderous, pervasive bureaucracy, which limits rather than promotes growth.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Population</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>19. The population growth rate has increased over most of the past two decades as the death rate declined more rapidly than the birth rate, but apparently now has leveled off. New Delhi sees its population reaching 600 million in 1975 and about 650 million by 1980. Inhibited by cultural and sociological factors and attitudes, population control programs have had little impact and the government successively reduced family planning programs in recent years. No significant abatement of population growth is likely over the next half decade.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Agriculture</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. About three-fourths of India's population are farmers. Agriculture provides about half of India's gross national product and much of the raw material base for Indian industry. In recent years, agricultural products contributed directly or indirectly to about 70 percent of India's export earnings. Indian agriculture is critically dependent on the timing and intensity of the summer monsoon, which provides 75 percent of the annual rainfall.</p>
                        <p>21. India is a chronically grain-deficit nation. Following the record 1970/1971<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn6" type="source">Crop year, 1 July-30 June.</note> grain harvest of 108 million tons—an achievement that brought premature complacency and a relaxation of the production drive—grain production has averaged 102 million tons annually and imports have climbed to meet the needs of the ever-growing population. In the crop year ending this June, grain production will total about 102 million tons. Imports will rise to about 8 million tons. With 4 million tons purchased from US in the year ending this June, India has become the leading foreign purchaser of US wheat.</p>
                        <p>22. Agricultural growth has been hindered by inconsistent central policies and the lack of sustained effort. Following an agricultural crisis, agriculture has generally been given priority, but after a few good harvests, resources have often been reduced, agricultural programs shunted aside, and long-term projects postponed. Moreover, government interference in grain marketing through trade restrictions and attempts at price controls have inhibited producer incentives.</p>
                        <p>23. Over the longer term, the potential exists for a considerable expansion of Indian agricultural output:

                        </p>
                        <p>25. India's economic planners have given priority to the development of heavy industry, increased public ownership of industrial facilities, and the substitution of domestic production for imports. These objectives have been pursued through ubiquitous licensing of construction and imports of commodities, technology and services, widespread price regulation, and selective nationalization of individual firms and whole industries. In Indian terms much has been achieved, in the sense that imports have grown less rapidly than elsewhere, and government ownership of industry has increased. But industrial production, which grew at rates of 10 to 20 percent in other advanced developing countries, has increased only 1 to 2 percent in India over the past two years, and chronic shortages prevail.</p>
                        <p>26. The basic course of industrial development is likely to remain unchanged over the next several years. Industrial performance will probably improve somewhat, but serious problems will persist. Development of India's abundant mineral resources should be spurred by the increased cost of imports. The transport network is well-developed and technicians are in good supply. The government has loosened some industrial controls during the past year. Nonetheless, the policy of strict government control over industry, which has limited growth in the past, has not been abandoned. India will continue to be plagued by power shortages, transportation bottlenecks, import restrictions, and labor disputes.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>27. Commercial fuels account for little more than half of Indian energy consumption despite their steadily increasing use. India is self-sufficient in coal, which accounts for 60 percent of commercial fuel consumption. Hydroelectric and nuclear power provide another 15 percent, and petroleum,. the most rapidly growing source of energy—increasing by nearly 10 percent per year over the past decade—accounts for 25 percent.</p>
                        <p>28. With imports providing about two-thirds of petroleum consumed, the recent increases in Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) oil prices severely strained India's finances. New Delhi was compelled to place a ceiling on <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 petroleum imports, forcing a decline in volume despite a doubling of outlays.</p>

                        <p>29. The energy gap created by curtailment of petroleum imports cannot quickly be covered by conservation, changeovers to alternative energy sources, or increased domestic production. Eighty-five percent of petroleum use is in industry, which has long been plagued by energy shortages. Chronic power shortages and rationing have been major constraints on industrial growth. Although New Delhi has promoted industrial use of coal in preference to oil since early 1973, coal production continues to lag behind both production targets and demand. Recent offshore oil discoveries show considerable promise, but will not make a significant contribution to energy resources for several years. Hydroelectric and nuclear power can also be expanded, but their development will continue to be slow and costly. Despite a newly-launched drive to boost both coal and petroleum production, India will remain short of energy, and petroleum imports will have to increase about 30 percent by 1980 if the energy shortage is not to worsen.</p>

The same level of aid will be more difficult to obtain in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975. New Delhi, therefore, will have to resort to some combination of the following measures: dipping into its foreign exchange reserves ( $1.4 billion at the end of March ), increasing International Monetary Fund borrowings, pressing for debt rescheduling, and further curtailing imports. The last measure would entail the risk of further retarding economic growth. Improved production of foodgrains and energy will be critical to reduction of the trade deficit.</p>

                        <p>32. In the near term at least, India's economic hopes continue to be tied to the weather. Agricultural recovery, even to the levels of four years ago, would stimulate an upturn throughout the economy. On the other hand, with grain stocks—both government and private—depleted by three years of disappointing agricultural performance, several successive good years would be needed to rebuild the stocks that are essential to economic stability and resiliency. Considering historic weather patterns, the odds against such a run of good fortune are formidable. New Delhi, therefore, is likely to continue needing substantial foodgrain imports during the next three to five years. Consecutive monsoon failures, as occurred in the mid-1960s, could pushannual grain imports to 10 million tons or more. Without a major reorientation of agricultural policies, moreover, periods of improved foodgrain pro: duction are likely to last only until the next poor monsoon.</p>
                        <p>33. To decrease the magnitude- of annual fluctuations in agricultural production, a sustained program of increased agricultural investment, especially in irrigation, would be required. The government will probably be unwilling, however, to devote to agriculture the resources necessary for such a sustained program in view of competing priorities, especially energy requirements. Given the government's limited resources, a large increase in foreign and domestic private investment would be necessary to stimulate growth in both agriculture and industry.</p>
                        <p>34. India's leadership will continue to restrain the development of the private sector and will not abandon its preference for public enterprise. Although the recent acute economic dislocations have led to selective relaxation of controls on the private sector, past performance suggests that this relaxation will be only temporary. The Indian view is that the country is passing through one of its periods of adversity—and that this one is not as bad as some others were. While there may be more experimentation in economic policy than in the past, we believe that major changes are not to be expected. Consequently, India will continue to exist from one monsoon to the next and from one consortium meeting to another.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">III. FOREIGN RELATIONS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>35. In coming years, India's foreign relations are likely to be conditioned more by its search for food, fuel and foreign exchange and less by its traditional search for security and an international role. While India's resource requirements may make New Delhi more responsive to foreign opinion at certain times or on certain issues, they are not likely to reverse India's present assertiveness, particularly in South Asia, following its debut as a nuclear power and its establishment of regional predominance.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d201-13" facs="d201-13"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">India and Its Neighbors</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>36. India's nuclear test and incorporation of Sikkim last year revived regional fears of Indian expansionism, particularly in Pakistan and Nepal. Although New Delhi will try to maintain cordial relations with its neighbors, it will on occasion resort to pressure tactics to achieve its objectives. As a result, there will continue to be uneasiness in the area over India's intentions.</p>
                        <p>37. India has no major bilateral disputes with Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Afghanistan. In the case of Afghanistan, both New Delhi and Kabul will consider the other a potential asset in dealing with Islamabad. Indian technical and military assistance to Afghanistan may increase marginally, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue to be Afghanistan's major donor. We do not believe India would encourage a conflict between Afghanistan and Pakistan or would become involved in such a conflict.</p>
                        <p>38. Elsewhere, however, India's relations with its neighbors are likely to be correct at best, and there will be considerable potential for tensions. India will insist on remaining the dominant foreign influence in Nepal and will continue to be suspicious of Nepal's relations with other powers, especially China; yet should India be unwilling to continue past allotments of fuel and other commodities, it might force Nepal to seek stronger and more direct ties with outside powers. Moreover, Nepal remains apprehensive over the implications of India's incorporation of Sikkim. New Delhi may use its control over Nepal's economy and Nepalese dissidents in India to pressure Kathmandu; however, India is unlikely to support an effort to overthrow the monarchy.</p>
                        <p>39. India's relations with Bangladesh will continue to suffer from the big neighbor syndrome and the Bengalee propensity to blame their problems on their larger neighbor. These psychological antagonisms exacerbate the already difficult negotiations over such bilateral issues as the division of the Ganga waters and offshore boundaries affect. ing oil rights. India will continue its efforts to assuage Bengalee sensitivities and will try to accommodate Bangladesh's interests where possible,but given its own domestic needs and expressions of Bengalee resentment, Indian flexibility will be limited. More important, an international crisis could erupt in the event of a political upheaval in Bangladesh. New Delhi will be prepared, if necessary and on request, to intervene militarily to restore the authority of the present government in Dacca. Should disorders in Bangladesh appear likely to produce a radical Bengalee leadership or spread instability to parts of India, New Delhi might reluctantly intervene on its own initiative. Any Indian intervention in Bangladesh would be a matter of serious concern to Pakistan and China. Nevertheless, neither would be likely to take military action.</p>
                        <p>40. Relations between India and Pakistan have evolved significantly in the past two years, largely because both countries have enjoyed civilian government under skillful and realistic political leadership. On both sides a new generation of government officials, less committed to the pursuit of traditional disputes, has begun to emerge. Although still tenuous, the Simla process ( bilateral negotiations flowing from the 1972 Simla Agreement) has made considerable progress and could provide an important precedent for the resolution of future differences. Issues still outstanding under the Simla. Agreement, such as restoration of diplomatic relations, might be postponed indefinitely, but they could be restored quickly if the general atmosphere improved.</p>
                        <p>41. Yet there are clear limits to further improvement in Indo-Pakistani relations for the foreseeable future: mutual distrust remains high; the disagreement over Kashmir appears intractable; and on all bilateral issues, India will generally insist on bilateral negotiations while Pakistan will seek outside mediation or influence when possible. IndoPakistani relations will continue to be influenced by relations of each with the major world powers. Future Indian nuclear tests will aggravate Pakistan's sense of insecurity. For its part, India will remain highly sensitive to Pakistan's arms purchases. The resumption of US arms sales in South Asia could complicate the Simla process, depending <pb n="14" xml:id="d201-14" facs="d201-14"/>on the nature and quantity of US sales. Finally, should Pakistan return to military government or should widespread disorders occur in either country, Indo-Pakistani relations could again become highly unstable.</p>
                        <p>42. We see no prospects for a breakthrough which could alter fundamentally the Indo-Pakistani relationship of antagonism and competition which has prevailed since each country gained independence. We do not, however, foresee circumstances in which either India or Pakistan would provoke hostilities. On balance, we believe that present trends favor stability in relations between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The Periphery</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>43. During the past few years, India's focus on the periphery of South Asia has shifted from Southeast Asia to the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. This shift is likely to become more pronounced as India's fuel requirements take growing precedence, and even should recent Indian offshore oil discoveries prove substantial, the massive foreign exchange accumulations of the Guff states will be a magnet for India's attention. Oil considerations will also reinforce India's longstanding and multi-motivated support of the Arabs vis-à-vis Israel.</p>
                        <p>44. India and Iran both recognize the potential power and influence of the other, and they may over the long term become regional competitors. India will be increasingly concerned with the growth of Iran's military power and the close Iranian-Pakistani relations. For the present, however, each appears more interested in developing a symbiotic relationship. It seems likely that Iran will continue for the next several years to provide a major portion of India's fuel imports on terms which India can manage.</p>
                        <p>45. India will continue to play on its Arab ties and its ability to provide technical and military assistance to cultivate Iraq as another source of oil and investment. Similarly, India will seek greater influence in the smaller Gulf states and Saudi Arabia but will probably continue to be preemptedin these countries by Muslim Pakistan. Indian resentment and frustrations over recent oil price increases are likely to remain buried under India's interest in receiving Arab assistance as well as a commitment to the prevention of exploitation of raw material suppliers by the industrialized nations. Hence India would probably criticize but tacitly welcome consumer pressures—short of military intervention—to reduce prices.</p>
                        <p>46. India will continue its efforts to expand its presence and influence in the Indian Ocean area. It will increase and modernize its Navy as rapidly as resources permit. India will also pursue the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace proposal, criticizing the military presence of outside powers in the area and focusing on the US presence and the “base” on Diego Garcia. India is unlikely to be as vocal over the issue during the next few years as in the past because of concern for its relations with both the US and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">China and the Soviet Union</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>47. We see little prospect for either a serious confrontation or a fundamental improvement in relations between India and China. The presently unresolved border dispute will not preclude a thaw in relations—indeed, the initiatives of both governments over the past two years may have paved the way for an early exchange of ambassadors. Yet while the interests of each country favor a relaxation of tensions, they provide little motivation for a resolution of fundamental differences.</p>
                        <p>48. New Delhi and Peking will continue to regard each other with suspicion and are likely to remain at odds over regional questions. Peking will not sacrifice its ties with Pakistan, New Delhi will not sacrifice its ties with Moscow, and China will remain hostile to Indian demonstrations of power. Even should the present leadership of either government be replaced, the successor regime would be unlikely to undertake new foreign policy initiatives for at least several years. In this case, Sino-Indian relations might deteriorate but could hardly improve.</p>
                        <p>49. As in the past, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will pursue strong ties with India in an attempt to further Soviet <pb n="15" xml:id="d201-15" facs="d201-15"/>influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean and to limit or reduce the influence of the US in these areas. The Indo-Soviet relationship, however, reached a peak during the special circumstances of 1971 which are unlikely to be equaled for the foreseeable future. For a variety of mutual political, economic, and security interests, relations between the two will remain close, but they will continue to suffer strains over the terms of debt repayments, trade balances, and arms deliveries and will be influenced by the relations between each and China. Relations will also continue to reflect a fundamental difference of national interests: Soviet interests in South Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Third World encourage Moscow to appear close to New Delhi; Indian interests in the same areas, however, require New Delhi to maintain a visible distance from Moscow. There is evidence of continuing Soviet concern over a possible improvement in Sino-Indian relations; Moscow can be expected to encourage Sino-Indian suspicions.</p>
                        <p>50. The Soviets will continue where possible to be responsive to Indian requests for economic and military assistance. They will be unlikely to match the two million ton grain loan of 1973 in the near future, and they are likely to demand higher prices and press for foreign exchange payments. They may also try to link future assistance, especially in military equipment, to political concessions such as endorsement of the Brezhnev Asian collective security scheme or Soviet access to Indian naval facilities. India would be unlikely to grant such concessions; even the US resumption of arms sales to Pakistan will probably not of itself lead to a closer Indo-Soviet embrace unless US arms supplies appear to provide a potential challenge to Indian military dominance on the subcontinent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">The United States</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>51. New Delhi has clearly sought to reduce the imbalance in its relations with the United States and the Soviet Union and, more specifically, to establish a new and more realistic relationship with Washington. India's strategic interests have been enhanced by the removal of several key traditional irritants. The end of direct US involvement in Indochina hasremoved India's compulsion to criticize publicly US actions. The severe reduction of US aid programs and the resolution of the US-owned rupee holdings issue has removed the resentment of the charity recipient and the need to demonstrate constantly India's political independence of its economic benefactor. Also, India has welcomed Washington's encouragement of bilateral negotiations with Pakistan under the Simla Agreement.</p>
                        <p>52. Although these positive trends are likely to result in more stable Indo-US relations than in the past, the relationship will probably remain a shallow one subject to uncertainties.<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3" type="source">The Defense Intelligence Agency does not believe that increased stability in Indo-US relations is likely. Such problem areas as US activities in the Indian Ocean, arms sales to Pakistan, and Indian nuclear developments will inhibit movement toward stability. The Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of the Army, the Director of Naval Intelligence, Department of the Navy, and the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, Department of the Air Force concur in this view.</note> There will be sporadic resumptions of anti-US invective, particularly during periods of domestic political difficulty. India will remain highly suspicious of US intentions and activities. Despite New Delhi's initially restrained reaction to the US resumption of lethal military equipment sales to South Asia, any significant US or third country arms sales to Pakistan will probably raise strong public and official Indian protest. During the coming election campaign, we can anticipate new allegations of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> activities against India, and the enlargement of Diego Garcia's facilities will remain a sore point. The question of India's nuclear program will continue to pit US concerns over proliferation against Indian sensitivity over what it views as its sovereign rights.</p>
                        <p>53. Questions of aid, particularly food assistance, will remain vexing, although hardly to the degree of earlier years. The Indian Government appears ready to accept at face value the availability of, and Congressional constraints on, the amount of US food-grains it can hope to receive, but in years of severe shortages will continue to look to Washington for a miracle. Moreover, New Delhi will remain particularly sensitive to the nature and publicity of concessional <pb n="16" xml:id="d201-16" facs="d201-16"/>food sales. The Indians will probably expect future non-food aid programs to remain low, but will be particularly concerned over US responsiveness toward debt rescheduling; whatever Congressional attitudes may be on this issue, New Delhi will expect Washington to be at least as generous as other aid donors.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">IV. MILITARY AND NUCLEAR PROSPECTS</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>54. India intends to maintain large, modern military forces with the capability to project significant air, land, and sea power throughout South Asia. Its Army, the third largest in the world, has maintained its personnel strength at a constant level for a decade, although in the same period the number of combat troops has more than doubled. Air Force, naval, and paramilitary forces have also greatly increased. Inventories of modern equipment have generally kept pace with unit and manpower increases. Continued modernization of all three services is expected; expansion of the Navy will probably receive special attention.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Military Capabilities</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>55. The 1971 war with Pakistan demonstrated India's preeminence as a military power in South Asia. Pakistan has made improvements in its military capabilities since then, but its forces are no match for India's. Although the two armies are generally comparable in terms of leadership, morale, organization, training, and the competence of the individual soldier, the Indian armed forces are much larger and are generally better equipped. Even though the normal deployment of 11 divisions along the Chinese border constitutes a constraint, the Indians could divert five to six of the divisions, as they did in 1971, and overcome Pakistani defenses within a period of weeks. Pakistan has increased its efforts to develop a domestic armaments industry and acquire sophisticated military equipment, primarily from the UK, France, China, and now the United States. Nevertheless, given India's existing lead and its relative size, industrial strength and resource base, the gap in military capabilities between the two countries will widen.</p>
                        <p>56. India's military strength has, in fact, evolved to the point where India could probably defend itself successfully against a conventional attack by. China or a combined Chinese-Pakistani attack, although it would have to relinquish some territory to the Chinese. If the Chinese were to use nuclear weapons—a very unlikely possibility—the equation would be drastically altered.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Defense Production and Arms Imports</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>57. While India's arms industry fulfills most of its defense requirements, India still must import significant quantities of sophisticated equipment and some components and raw materials used in production processes. Since the mid-1960s, about 70 percent of India's military imports have come from the Soviet Union. Moscow's commitment to maintain Indian military dominance on the subcontinent was underscored by a new long-term military assistance agreement reached in February 1975 covering naval and ground forces equipment and reported to be the largest yet concluded between the two.</p>
                        <p>58. India is self-sufficient in the production of small arms, light artillery, ammunition, and general purpose vehicles. With extensive foreign assistance, India also produces such major items as tanks, jet aircraft, helicopters, and ASW escorts. Large-scale procurement of sophisticated foreign equipment will continue to be required to meet India's perceived military requirements. It is estimated that India will receive $180 to $260 million of such equipment—primarily from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe—during 1975. Future deliveries will probably include medium tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, surface-to-air missiles, aircraft, and naval units. While the military would prefer arms from Western and even US sources—because of higher reliability and better follow-on support—India will continue to procure its major systems from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> because of the more favorable Soviet terms. Western sources will, however, continue to provide a steady flow of spare parts and components for India's domestic military production programs. India will probably seek to acquire carrier-based, ASW, and advanced tactical strike <pb n="17" xml:id="d201-17" facs="d201-17"/>aircraft. Cruisers, destroyers, guided missile patrol boats, and transport aircraft are also items of interest.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="strong">Nuclear Capabilities and Prospects</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>59. The Indians conducted an underground test of a nuclear device in the Rajasthan Desert in May 1974. [text not declassified] The announced purpose was a peaceful nuclear explosion experiment. Although there have been numerous rumors of plans for a second test, there is no hard evidence of preparations for such an event.<note n="4" xml:id="d201fn4" type="source">Dr. H. N. Sethna, head of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, stated that India had no program for further underground nuclear explosions but that another test might be required if the evaluation of the results of the 1974 experiment indicates a need for additional data.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>60. Although several countries reacted strongly to the Indian test, only Canada has taken significant steps to stop the flow of materials and equipment to the Indian nuclear program. One of the two Canadian CANDU-type ( natural uranium-fueled, heavy water moderated and cooled) power reactors at the Rajasthan Atomic Power Plant ( RAPP II) is still under construction; Canada has refused to continue assistance in building this reactor pending the resolution of an agreement on future Indian actions. Canada is asking India for: a ) assurance that India will not use the plutonium from the CANDU reactors being built by Canada ( RAPP I and II ) for the production of any nuclear explosive devices; b) assurance that India will assist in curbing the spread of nuclear explosive technology to other nations; and c) an agreement that plutonium from the 40 megawatt ( thermal) Canadian-supplied CIRUS research reactor ( near Bombay) will not be used in any future nuclear explosive devices. India has agreed to the first two conditions, but has not yet accepted the third.</p>
                        <p>[text not declassified]</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="d201-18" facs="d201-18"/>
                        <p>[text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>63. The Indians are aware that they will continue for some time to need assistance in their nuclear program from foreign suppliers such as the United States and Canada. Slowdowns and cutbacks in the wake of the May 1974 test have already set back that program by two or three years. India's need for economic as well as nuclear assistance may have an impact on the timing and pace of Indian testing, although technical factors should not be ruled out. While India could conduct another. test in the near future, these considerations appear likely to convince Indian leaders to delay another test for the time being. Nevertheless, we believe that India will conduct additional tests over the next few years.</p>
                        <p>[text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>65. India is not now in a position to export nuclear components and facilities. By the end of the decade, however, it probably will be able to export these items. Even today, India could export some services, particularly those that involve technical assistance and the management of nuclear facilities. New Delhi has no intention of forceclosing the option of becoming a major nuclear exporter. At this juncture we do not know what role India might be willing to play in cooperation with established nuclear states to limit proliferation. The Indian government has been unwilling to make a public commitment to restrict its exports of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes; it has given private assurances only to the extent that it will not assist any weapons program. We expect India to maintain this position regardless of foreign pressures for at least several years. When the question becomes real, India will review its position in light of the prevailing international situation. On balance, we do not foresee circumstances in which India would deliberately contribute to the development of a nuclear explosive capability on the part of a nonnuclear nation.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> PHONED ME A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO INVITING ME FOR A DISCUSSION PRIOR TO A DINNER WHICH HE LATER GAVE IN OUR HONOR. WE HAD AN UNUSUALLY GOOD, WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION WHICH COVERED SOME MATTERS THAT I WOULD HOPE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU ON OUR COMING HOME LEAVE WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOW ME TO BE IN WASHINGTON EITHER LATER THIS MONTH OR IN JULY.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> TOOK ME INTO HIS CONFIDENCE ON DOMESTIC POLITICAL MATTERS HERE TO AN EXTENT WHICH WAS UNUSUAL, WHILE CAUTIONING ME NOT TO MENTION HIS PLANS TO EVEN HIS CLOSEST CONFIDANTS. IN THIS CONNECTION HE TOLD ME OF HIS PLANS TO CALL ELECTIONS FOR DECEMBER 1976 AND OF HIS GREAT HOPE IN WINNING A SIZEABLE MANDATE. HE TALKED FREELY ABOUT HIS SUCCESSES, AND SOME FAILURES, TO DATE AND HIS HOPES OF WHAT HE COULD ACCOMPLISH FOR PAKISTAN WITH AN EXTENDED TOUR AS PRIME MINISTER. ALTHOUGH THE IMAGE OF PAKISTAN HAS BEEN GREATLY ENHANCED DURING HIS PRESENT TERM, HE CLEARLY ENVISAGES MORE PROGRESS IN THE FUTURE. HE FORESEES A ROLE FOR PAKISTAN WHICH COULD NOT ONLY BE MORE IMPORTANT PER SE BUT MORE IMPORTANT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF SUPPORT OF OVERALL U.S. INTERESTS.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>THE ABOVE DISCUSSION LED TO HIS NOTING THE EXTREME IMPORTANCE HE ATTACHES TO PL-480 FOOD GRAINS IN THE COMING YEAR. HE ASKED WHAT I THOUGHT THE CHANCES WERE. I REPLIED THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A GOOD YEAR FOR US AND THAT I HAD VERY TENTATIVE HOPES WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO HALF A MILLION TONS OF WHEAT. HE ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY CHANCE THAT IT COULD BE INCREASED TO A MILLION. I TOLD HIM I DOUBTED IT VERY MUCH. I SAID I FELT IT ONLY FAIR TO HIM TO TELL HIM THAT I WOULD ANTICIPATE OPPOSITION IN WASHINGTON ON ANY SUCH FIGURE BASED UPON THE FEAR THAT THIS AMOUNT OF CONCESSIONAL ASSISTANCE MIGHT LEAD TO A RELAXATION OF DETERMINATION HERE TO MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT PAKISTAN DEVELOPED TO ITS FULLEST ABILITY ITS OWN POTENTIAL FOR FOOD PRODUCTION. I MENTIONED EXCESSIVELY SUBSIDIZED PRICES, WHAT HAS AMOUNTED TO SEMI-FORCED PROCUREMENT OF WHEAT FROM THE FARMERS, LACK OF SUFFICIENT FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, MORE EFFICIENT USE OF WATER AND IN GENERAL THE ITEMS WE KEEP PLUGGING AWAY AT HERE IN OUR AID PROGRAM TO INSURE GREATER LOCAL INCENTIVE AND PRODUCTIVITY. SOME OF THIS TOUCHED A SENSITIVE NERVE BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT POLITICAL RISKS SOME OF THESE MEASURES ENTAIL.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SOUGHT TO CONVINCE ME THAT HE HAD TAKEN POLITICAL RISKS IN HIS RECENT RAISE OF FOOD PRICES (HE SAYS PARTLY IN RESPONSE TO MY ADVICE) AND IN OTHER EFFORTS WHICH LED TO HIS <pb n="3" xml:id="d202-03" facs="d202-03"/>CURRENT CONSERVATIVE AND RATHER TOUGH BUDGET NOW BEFORE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. I GAVE HIM FULL MARKS FOR THIS AS WELL AS FOR THE GOALS HE HAS LAID DOWN FOR INCREASE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WHICH I DO INDEED BELIEVE WILL RESULT IN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HERE THIS YEAR AND MORE MARKEDLY SO IN NEXT YEAR.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> PULLED NO PUNCHES IN MAKING HIS PERSONAL REQUEST TO ME RE FOOD ASSISTANCE, SAYING IT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HIM IN THE ELECTION PROCESS AND IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF HIS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE AS HE HAD OUTLINED THEM TO ME. HE ASKED IF I WOULD TALK TO YOU PERSONALLY AND FRANKLY ON THIS SUBJECT WHEN I WENT HOME AND I SAID THAT I WOULD. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S HOPES ARE VERY SPECIFIC ALTHOUGH HE ACCEPTS THE FACT THAT WE PROBABLY COULD NOT GO AS MUCH AS A MILLION TONS UNDER PL-480. HIS REQUEST, THEREFORE, WAS FOR 700 THOUSAND TONS PL-480, 250-300 THOUSAND IN CC CREDITS. I TOLD HIM I WOULD SEE WHAT WAS POSSIBLE.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>BESIDES THE POLICY QUESTION ON MILITARY SUPPLY, WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY HANDLED, THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND REQUEST OF ME THAT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> HAS PUT IN SUCH PERSONAL TERMS. AS I SURVEY THE LOCAL POLITICAL SITUATION THE CONCLUSION SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT U.S. INTERESTS WOULD BE SERVED BY THE CONTINUATION IN POWER OF <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. FURTHER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MEETING HIS REQUEST IN SUCH MAGNITUDE WOULD LESSEN HIS RESOLVE TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO MAKE PAKISTAN SELF-SUFFICIENT. HE HAS PROVED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TO BE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO OUR SUGGESTIONS ON MATTERS SUCH AS FOOD AND FERTILIZER PRICES SO AS TO GIVE INCENTIVE TO THE FARMERS EVEN THOUGH THESE HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN POLITICALLY DIFFICULT FOR HIM. I REALIZE THE TIME FOR DECISION RE NEXT YEAR'S PL-480 ALLOCATIONS IS SOME TIME AWAY BUT I WANTED TO GIVE THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THIS MATTER TO YOU PERSONALLY AT AN EARLY DATE SO THAT THE EVENTUAL DECISION WOULD NOT BE OVERLY SWAYED BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS.</item>

                                <p>QUOTE: DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,</p>
                                <p>I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO WRITE TO YOU ON A MATTER OF VITAL INTEREST BOTH TO THE SECURITY OF PAKISTAN AND TO THE PEACE AND STABILITY OF OUR VAST AND POPULOUS REGION. HOWEVER, SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH MOMENTOUS ISSUES RELATING TO EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST, I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL YOU RETURNED HOME AND HAD TIME TO ADDRESS YOUR ATTENTION TO OTHER MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO WORLD PEACE. <pb n="2" xml:id="d203-02" facs="d203-02"/>ON MAY 22, SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> AND MY MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENCE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MR. AZIZ AHMED, MET IN ANKARA. IN THE COURSE OF THAT MEETING, DR. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> INFORMED MR. <persName>AHMED</persName> THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER GROMYKO IN VERY STRONG TERMS TO THE EFFECT THAT AN INDIAN ATTACK ON PAKISTAN WITH SOVIET EQUIPMENT WOULD INVITE A RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED STATES.</p>
                                <p>IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT PRACTICALLY ALL OF INDIA'S ARMED FORCES ARE EQUIPPED WITH SOVIET WEAPONS. MOREOVER, IN VIEW OF THE INDO-SOVIET TREATY OF 1971, AN ARMED ATTACK ON PAKISTAN BY INDIA WOULD NECESSARILY CARRY SOVIET APPROVAL AND, INDEED, DIRECT INVOLVEMENT.</p>
                                <p>AS YOU ARE AWARE, MR. PRESIDENT, MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO FURTHER THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH INDIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SIMLA AGREEMENT. WE WILL SUSTAIN THIS POLICY AS LONG AS IT IS RECIPROCATED BY INDIA. NEVERTHELESS, OUR CONSIDERED ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION, AS MR. <persName>AHMED</persName> CONVEYED TO DR. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>, IS THAT WAR COULD COME AT ANY TIME THE SOVIET UNION WANTED IT, AS INDIA WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN CONTRIVING AN EXCUSE FOR STARTING ONE. FOR INSTANCE, INDIA COULD BRAZENLY ASSERT ITS SPURIOUS CLAIM TO THE WHOLE OF THE STATE OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF INDIA AND PREPARE THE STAGE FOR AN INVASION OF AZAD KASHMIR ON THE PRETEXT THAT IT SOUGHT TO RELEASE IT FROM PAKISTAN'S CONTROL. ALL-OUT HOSTILITIES WOULD BE INELUCTABLE RESULT.</p>
                                <p>DR. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> ASKED WHAT CHINA WOULD DO IN THE EVENT OF AN INDIAN ATTACK <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> PAKISTAN. WE HAD PUT PRECISELY THE SAME QUESTION TO THE CHINESE VICE-PREMIER WHEN HE VISITED PAKISTAN RECENTLY. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ARE CONSIDERING THIS QUESTION BUT HAVE GIVEN US NO ANSWER SO FAR. THEIR DECISION IN THIS REGARD CANNOT BUT BE INFLUENCED BY THE EXISTENCE OF THE INDO-SOVIET TREATY. THE CONSTRAINT ON CHINA'S FREEDOM TO ACT AS A RESULT OF THIS TREATY WAS TRAGICALLY DEMONSTRATED WHEN INDIA ATTACKED PAKISTAN IN 1971. CHINA WAS HAMSTRUNG WHILE PAKISTAN WAS DISMEMBERED WITH SOVIET INSTIGATION AND SUPPORT.</p>
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d203-03" facs="d203-03"/>
                                <p>DR. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> THEN ENQUIRED WHETHER HE COULD ASK CHINA WHAT EXACTLY IT WOULD DO IF INDIA ATTACKED PAKISTAN AND ADDED THAT, IF CHINA POSED THE COUNTER-QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD DO IN SUCH AN EVENT, IT WOULD BE INFORMED THAT IF INDIA ATTACKED PAKISTAN AND CHINA CAME TO ITS HELP AND IF IN CONSEQUENCE THE SOVIET UNION ATTACKED CHINA, THE UNITED STATES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STAY OUT OF THAT SITUATION.</p>
                                <p>TO PAKISTAN, CONFRONTED WITH AN OVERWHELMING MILITARY THREAT FROM INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN, BOTH ARMED AND BACKED BY THE SOVIET UNION, THIS FORTHRIGHT ENUNCIATION OF THE DETERMINATION OF THE UNITED STATES TO WARD OFF A DANGER OF VAST AND INCALCULABLE PROPORTIONS COMES AS MOST WELCOME NEWS, I AM DEEPLY IMPRESSED, MR. PRESIDENT, BY THE CLARITY WITH WHICH YOUR ADMINISTRATION HAS PERCEIVED THE IMPLICATIONS OF AN ATTACK ON PAKISTAN FOR THE PEACE AND STABILITY OF THIS STRATEGIC AREA. THIS UNCLOUDED APPROACH ENVISAGES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A CONCRETE STEP WHICH COULD RESTORE THE POWER EQUILIBRIUM IN THIS REGION. THIS COULD OPERATE AS A DECISIVE FACTOR IN MAINTAINING PEACE, DEFENDING FREEDOM AND PROTECTING THE VITAL INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES IN SOUTH ASIA. IF THE SHADOW OF BLACKMAIL AND THE SPECTRE OF WAR WHICH DARKEN THE HORIZONS OF THIS STRIFE-TORN SUBCONTINENT WERE REMOVED FROM IT, A TURNING POINT WOULD BE REACHED IN ITS HISTORY. THE GLOBAL BALANCE OF POWER WOULD GAIN REALITY AND THE STRUCTURE OF PEACE IN OUR CRITICAL REGION COULD BECOME TRULY INVIOLABLE.</p>

                                <p>AS YOU ARE AWARE, WE HAVE DONE, AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO, OUR UTMOST TO NORMALIZE OUR RELATIONS WITH INDIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SIMLA AGREEMENT. NEVERTHELESS, WE <pb n="4" xml:id="d203-04" facs="d203-04"/>ARE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED OVER THE PROBABILITY OF INDIA DECIDING TO LAUNCH A WAR AGAINST PAKISTAN IN WHICH AFGAHNISTAN WILL ALSO JOIN AND BOTH WILL HAVE THE FULL BACKING OF THE SOVIET UNION. SUCH A WAR COULD COME AT ANY TIME THE SOVIET UNION SHOULD JUDGE THE SITUATION TO BE RIPE. IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IT COULD BE UNLEASHED WITHIN TWO YEARS, BEFORE WE HAVE HAD THE TIME ADEQUATELY TO STRENGTHEN OUR DEFENCE CAPABILITY. INDIA COULD CONTRIVE A PRETEXT ON THE BASIS OF ITS BRAZEN CLAIM TO JAMMU AND KASHMIR BEING AN INTEGRAL PART OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN BEING IN CONTROL OF A PART OF THE STATE.</p>

                        <p>AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, I WAS RELIEVED TO HEAR FROM MR. <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> WHAT YOU HAD TOLD GROMYKO AND WHAT YOU PLANNED TO TELL THE CHINESE ABOUT THE ACTION THE UNITED STATES WOULD TAKE IF THE SOVIET UNION ATTACKED CHINA FOR COMING TO PAKISTAN'S ASSISTANCE IN THE EVENT OF AN INDIAN ATTACK ON PAKISTAN.</p>
                        <p>THIS LATTER ASSURANCE COULD HAVE A MOST VITAL BEARING ON THE BALANCE OF POWER IN ASIA AND FORTIFY PEACE AND STABILITY IN THIS CRITICAL REGION. I CONSIDER IT TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE COUNTER YET TO THE SOVIET AMBITIONS TO EXTEND HEGEMONY TO PAKISTAN, WHICH IS THE IMMEDIATE TARGET OF THESE AMBITIONS, IT COMES AS A REFRESHING INDICATION OF A NEW DETERMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION TO SAFEGUARD PEACE AND STABILITY IN SOUTH ASIA.</p>
                        <p>I SHOULD ALSO ADD THAT THIS ASSURANCE IS ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF THE FAR-SIGHTED STATESMANSHIP AND CLARITY OF VISION WHICH I, LIKE MANY OTHERS, HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED IN YOU, ONLY SUCH A PERCEPTION OF LURKING DANGERS AND THE UN-DISTRACTED WILL TO AVERT THEM CAN TRANSFORM THE FEARS OF TODAY INTO THE HOPES OF TOMORROW.</p>
                        <p>MAY I SUGGEST THAT THE QUESTION OF CHINESE ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN IN THE EVENT OF AN INDIAN ATTACK MAY BE TAKEN UP WITH THE CHINESE LEADERS WHILE THEY ARE STILL CONSIDERING THE ISSUE. IT COULD HELP THEM MATERIALLY TO DECIDE WHAT CHINA COULD DO IN THAT CONTINGENCY.</p>

                            <item>BY THIS TIME IT IS CLEAR THAT A MAJOR CHANGE IS TAKING PLACE IN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA AND IT IS INCREASINGLY APPARENT THAT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REVERSE THE ACTIONS WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER HAS TAKEN IN ORDER TO ENFORCE HER CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE MANY UNCERTAINTIES, HOWEVER, IN REGARD TO FUTURE ACTIONS WHICH SHE MAY TAKE. HAVING STARTED OUT ON A COURSE OF CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT BY COERCION, SHE WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE FURTHER MOVES TO MAINTAIN HER POSITION. IT IS ALREADY RUMORED HERE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT SHE MAY DECLARE PRESIDENT'S RULE IN ALL OF THE STATES AS A WAY OF CONTROLLING OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES IN STATE LEGISLATURES, PARTICULARLY IN THOSE STATES WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES CONTROL THE GOVERNMENT (KERALA AND GUJARAT). THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO THE PROPER US GOVERNMENT STANCE UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES. ANY DECISIONS ON THIS MUST OBVIOUSLY BE HIGHLY TENTATIVE.</item>

                            <item>DURING THIS INITIAL WAIT-AND-SEE PERIOD WE BELIEVE THAT THE US SHOULD SEEK TO MAINTAIN THE BASIS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT IN US-INDIA RELATIONS AND AVOID ACTIONS WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THIS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE EITHER THE CAPACITY OR THE INTEREST TO MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN INDIA. OUR TENTATIVE ESTIMATE IS THAT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT CAN BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN OFFICE. THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO BE GAINED BY INTENTIONAL COMMENTS OR ACTIONS WHICH WOULD BE VIEWED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS UNFRIENDLY, AND CERTAINLY UNINTENTIONAL ACTIONS SHOULD BE AVOIDED. THUS FAR THERE IS EVERY INDICATION THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WISHES TO CONTINUE ON ITS INITIATIVE TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE US. DESPITE POLITICAL TEMPTATIONS THERE HAVE BEEN NO ATTACKS ON THE US AND SINCE THE CRISIS BROKE THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS REAFFIRMED ITS INTENTION TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE SUBCOMMISSIONS AND A COMMISSION MEETING. IN THE FUTURE THE FORM AND FUNCTIONING OF THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> MAY HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON THE NATURE OF COOPERATION WHICH CAN TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THE US AND INDIA. FOR EXAMPLE, EDUCATION AND CULTURAL COOPERATION WILL CLEARLY BE MUCH MORE LIMITED IN SCOPE IF RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOMS CONTINUE IN FORCE. ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL COOPERATION MAY BE AFFECTED BY NEW NATIONALIZATIONS. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT JUDGMENTS ON THIS SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL THE SITUATION IS CLEARER.</item>

                            <item>IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS VIEW, THE EMBASSY HAS ALREADY TAKEN CERTAIN MEASURES TO AVOID STIMULATING THE SUSPICION OF THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. FOR THE PRESENT WE ARE AVOIDING CONTACTS WITH LEADERS OF OPPOSITION PARTIES AND EXERCISING CAUTION IN REGARD TO OUR ASSOCIATIONS WITH CONGRESS PARTY MEMBERS UNFRIENDLY TO MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>. WE ARE RESTRICTING OUR BRIEFING OF THE AMERICAN PRESS TO DEEP BACKGROUNDING ON FACTS AND AVOIDING ANALYSIS AND PREDICTIONS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO ATTRIBUTION OR INDICATION OF AMERICAN SOURCES (SEE SEPTEL). WE DO NOT INTEND TO MAKE EMBASSY FACILITIES AVAILABLE TO AMERICAN CORRESPONDENTS IN ORDER TO AVOID CENSORSHIP. WE ARE LIMITING <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-SPONSORED PROGRAMS IN OUTLYING AREAS TO INSURE BOTH THAT THEY CAN SUCCESSFULLY TAKE PLACE UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS AND THAT THEY WILL NOT BE SEEN AS INCONSISTENT <pb n="3" xml:id="d204-03" facs="d204-03"/>WITH <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> ACTIONS.

                            <item>IN REGARD TO TRAVEL TO INDIA BY AMERICANS, WE SEE NO BASIS FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ADVISE AMERICAN CITIZENS TO STAY AWAY. ALL TOURIST SERVICES SEEM TO BE FUNCTIONING WELL AND AS YET THERE IS NO INDICATION OF WIDESPREAD CIVIL DISTURBANCE. IN THE PAST WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN DISTURBANCES THEY HAVE SELDOM AFFECTED FOREIGNERS. IN REGARD TO OFFICIAL TRAVELERS, WE BELIEVE EACH CASE SHOULD BE EXAMINED SEPARATELY. AMERICANS COMING FOR OPERATIONAL COORDINATION WITH INDIAN COLLEAGUES (E.G., SCIENTISTS) SHOULD COME UNLESS ADVISED TO THE CONTRARY. OTHERS PLANNING TO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC ACTIVITIES INVOLVING SPEECHES, SEMINARS, ETC., SHOULD NOT COME WITHOUT SEEKING ADVANCE APPROVAL FROM THE EMBASSY. DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS WISHING TO CONSULT WITH THE EMBASSY CONTINUE TO BE MOST WELCOME. THUS FAR WE BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO INDIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS BUT AT PRESENT ACCESS TO THE INDIAN PRESS WOULD BE SEVERELY LIMITED. NATURALLY, ALL INDIANS, OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL, WILL BE VERY CAREFUL IN ANY EXPRESSION OF VIEWS TO VISITORS.</item>

SO FAR AS US PRESS COMMENTS WERE CONCERNED, THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> COULDN'T CONTROL PRESS ACCUSATIONS AND ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE US GOVERNMENT MUCH LESS ABOUT ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE ESSENTIAL <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> POSITION WAS THAT WE WISHED TO HAVE FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND THAT THE EMBASSY WISHED BOTH INDIA AND ITS PRIME MINISTER WELL. HE EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THE NEED FOR CONSTANT VIGILANCE TO ENSURE <pb n="2" xml:id="d206-02" facs="d206-02"/>THAT IRRESPONSIBLE ELEMENTS (MENTIONING CONGRESS PRESIDENT BAROOAH AS BECOMING RATHER EMOTIONAL ON THE SUBJECT OF THE US ON SOME OCCASIONS) WERE NOT ABLE TO DAMAGE INDO-US RELATIONS.

                            <item>THE FOREIGN SECRETARY EXPRESSED HIS GREAT APPRECIATION FOR THE EFFORTS OF THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO SEE THAT NOTHING WAS DONE OR SAID OF EMBARRASSMENT TO INDIA WHILE THE GOI WAS GOING THROUGH ITS PRESENT DIFFICULT TIMES. THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> NEEDED US UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED ON THE PART OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CERTAIN UNPLEASANT, DIFFICULT MEASURES WHICH IT WAS HOPED WOULD ONLY BE VERY TEMPORARY. HE SAID THE GOI WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT INDO-US RELATIONS WERE OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WOULD BE WORKED OUT. HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE SAID OR DONE WHICH WOULD HURT INDO-US RELATIONS. SOME THINGS DID SLIP THROUGH THE CENSORS AND THIS COULD NOT ALWAYS BE AVOIDED, BUT OTHER THINGS HAD BEEN PICKED IN TIME WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD HAD THEY NOT BEEN CAUGHT. THE FOREIGN SECRETARY NOTED CONTINUING PROBLEMS WITH SOME FOREIGN NEWS STORIES, MENTIONING SPECIFICALLY POST CORRESPONDENT LEWIS SIMONS' “VICIOUS” ATTACKS ON THE PRIME MINISTER.</item>

                            <item>THE AMBASSADOR OFFERED THE FINAL SUGGESTION THAT POLITICAL ATTACKS IN INDIA ON SOME BILATERAL OR INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS WITH US INVOLVEMENT, SUCH AS THAT ON MOSQUITO BREEDING WHICH HAD CAUSED THE US TO WITHDRAW ITS SUPPORT OF THE PROJECT LAST MONTH, HAD TO BE AVERTED THROUGH CLOSER COORDINATION BETWEEN GOVTS ON SUCH PROJECTS. IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THE INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY TO ENSURE THAT ARRANGEMENTS FOR SUCH PROJECTS WERE FULLY COORDINATED AND APPROVED IN THE FUTURE AS TO PROVIDE BETTER PROTECTION FOR OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS.</item>

I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO HALTING CRITICISMS AND ATTACKS ON THE US BY AT LEAST SOME SENIOR INDIAN POLITICIANS. DESPITE THE NEW AUTHORITARIAN PITCH OF THE INDIAN POLITICAL SCENE, THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF CRACKS THROUGH WHICH IRRESPONSIBLE REMARKS CAN SLIP. BUT I STRONGLY SUSPECT OUR GENERAL POINT WILL BE PASSED PROMPTLY TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND I SUSPECT THE PRIME MINISTER AS WELL, AND PERHAPS SOMETHING WILL GET DONE, PARTICULARLY COMBINED WITH THE REPORTEDLY GENERALLY POSITIVE FLAVOR OF THE CONGRESSIONAL AID HEARINGS YESTERDAY.</item>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: My present tentative preference would be for the latter part of September, but I am open-minded about this. Sometime toward the end of September would be good.</p>

                            </hi>: What about the October 3-5 period? This would be good for the Foreign Minister since he would be making his speech at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> about this time. Can you say this is tentatively acceptable?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Yes, that is tentatively alright. I have a number of trips to make but I think I can work this into my schedule. <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> would come to Washington, isn't that so?</p>
                        <p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Make sure that we give the Subcommissions encouragement. We have no policy of going slow. I spoke with Goheen last week and understood his group (Education and Culture) was moving forward well.</p>

                            </hi>: I think the major difficulty is with the Science and Technology group. In the agriculture and energy area things are moving along slowly, but part of the problem is that ERDA is just getting established.</p>

                            </hi>: Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> asked me to renew her invitation to the President to visit India. Also if he has time I would welcome an opportunity to call on him.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We will try to arrange that and will be back in touch with you shortly. The President's schedule this year is getting somewhat crowded. I suppose it doesn't make much difference to you if his visit slips into the first quarter or so of 1976.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I will look at the schedule but it's getting somewhat crowded.</p>

                            </hi>: I was also asked by the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister to talk about the reporting of Lewis Simons of the Washington Post.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Didn't you expel him?</p>

                            </hi>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I would be delighted if we had the same right to expel Washington Post reporters here but there wouldn't be many left.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: He wrote that the Prime Minister's son had slapped her. This is perfectly scurrilous. He also claimed that the Prime Minister had used army troops to boost attendance at a political rally. Simons also insinuated that the Prime Minister had instigated the murder of the Railway Minister. He never took the trouble to check this out with anyone. He made these out of whole cloth.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Has he left the country?</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, but I was asked to point out this out in view of your protest of his expulsion. This was unnecessary. We could have taken very serious action against him. He could have been sued for libel. Under the emergency he could have been locked up. We would like for you to convey to the Post that this is not the way for a correspondent to act.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d207-04" facs="d207-04"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Well, we will tell the Post that we have an answer to our protest and you have rejected this. But you should see Kay Graham yourself. I would not want to get in the middle between two formidable women like Mrs. Graham and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>. We have a standard policy of protesting the expulsion of journalists. We have made our point and consider the matter closed.</p>
                        <p>I think you are familiar with the American situation. We have tried as a Government to show restraint. We have not encouraged the press to be critical of India. I said we attach importance to our relationship with India. But it is a problem for us when the same restraint is not shown on the Indian side, especially now that you have a censored press. Demonstrations have taken place. While Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> first made nice references about us, she has now obliquely made references about people who supported Yahya Khan and want good relations with China. We want reciprocity. You have to make up your mind.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: I think there was some misunderstanding of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s remarks. She was not talking about the U.S. Government, but the U.S. press.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I was not aware that the press supported Yahya Khan. You know intellectuals had a love affair with India. Now there is disappointment. I am not. I have always looked on India as a major power with whom we should have good relations. What the press says is not the United States Government's view. We are not going to comment on your internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: I have been meeting a number of Senators on the Hill, including Javits and Gaylord Nelson.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What does Gaylord Nelson say. He is influential.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: He says that this is our internal affair and he is not passing judgement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Let me ask you a question as a political scientist. What would happen if the Supreme Court upheld the judgement against Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>?</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d207-05" facs="d207-05"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: This could be overturned under the Constitution, but I do not think the Supreme Court will uphold the lower court's decision. One count was that the state government put up loud speakers and built the rostrum from which Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> spoke at a rally. But the state government was in the hands of the opposition. In any case the judge is inconsistent since he permitted the use of government funds for her transportation. The judge may also be wrong on the second count which revolves around the date someone legally becomes a candidate. I think the lower court was wrong on this and should have indicated that she became a candidate only on February 1 when she actually filed the papers, not earlier when she made a comment to a newspaperman. Even if the Court upholds the decision, the Election Commissioner can set aside the penalty. There has also been a proposal before Parliament to lower some of the penalties for minor election law violations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I was astonished by the penalty since the charges seem very slight.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>
                            </hi>: It was like jay-walking in the U.S. But we have to wait for the Supreme Court. This starts August 11, since the opposition asked for more time. The general feeling in Delhi is that the Supreme Court is likely to upset the state court's decision. Now about the proclamation of the emergency. As you are probably aware, it was the opposition call to the army and police not to obey orders that triggered trouble. The extremists of the left and right were planning arson, sabotage and political assassinations. Such groups have now been banned along with extremist religious groups, both Hindu and Moslem as well as one group, the Ananda Marg, which has followers in the U.S. These should have been banned long ago. My general impression is that the emergency has been widely accepted by a large part of the population, labor, business, students and lawyers. Prices are falling, the public system of distribution of food is functioning, inflation has dropped from 30 percent to 8 percent and there is much progress.</p>

                            </hi>: I agree. There is no alternative in the Congress Party. The party is solidly behind Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>. Five members were expelled because they were working with the Opposition. It is unfortunate that J.P. Narayan allowed himself to be exploited by extremists of the left and right. He was not a follower of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>. He was a Marxist/Leninist who went underground in 1942. A real Gandhian—Vinoba Bhave—has backed the proclamation of the emergency. I think the results will be evident in the near future. Of the people arrested, 85 percent are smugglers, black marketeers and criminals. Only 15 percent are political leaders and they are under house arrest. If the Opposition had waited until the next general elections, everything would be ok, but they took up illegal measures.</p>

                            </hi>: In my talks on the Hill, I have been a little disappointed that some Congressmen are asking that India not be given aid. It would create an unfavorable impression if an anti-India amendment were passed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We are against penalizing countries for their domestic developments. We are discouraging any punitive measures, but money for aid will be difficult to obtain this year on the Hill. I think we would be better off not to press the aid question now. We are open-minded on this and we can have private discussions on aid. Now on PL 480, which does not require the same sort of appropriation, we are ready to provide a substantial program although we have not set the final level.</p>

Let the neighbors of Hanoi enjoy the results of their loyal support. But there is a legal problem. Can we get a legal view if your program really blocks PL 480 Title I? We have no interest in looking for a pretext to prevent food aid to India. Now if our foreign policy relationship deteriorates you should not put it past me to look for a pretext not to give aid but not because of your aid for North Vietnam. Can we get a legal opinion from Monroe Leigh on this?</p>

In a move unprecedented in India's 28 years of independence, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">INDIRA GANDHI</persName>'s government, acting in accordance with the constitution, has assumed virtually dictatorial emergency powers and has carried out a major and well-planned crackdown against the political opposition. Several thousand persons have been arrested under the state of emergency, including <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s foremost critic, JAYAPRAKASH NARAYAN, and many other opposition politicians. Civil rights have been suspended and press censorship imposed. The government has also outlawed 26 small extremist right- and left-wing political organizations. In an obvious gesture to emphasize the legality of her actions, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has announced that the Indian Parliament will convene on July 21. The parliament, in which Gandhi's Congress Party enjoys large majorities in both houses, will approve the emergency declaration.</p>

Before the crackdown, India's political parties and press enjoyed a degree of freedom unusual in Asia. No government of independent India had ever before assumed emergency powers to deal exclusively with internal political matters or had undertaken wholesale arrests of non-Communist opposition politicians. Now that <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has taken such strong steps, it will be very difficult — perhaps impossible — for her to return to the status quo ante and restore complete freedom of action and expression to her embittered opponents.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s actions, nonetheless, have been legal under the Indian constitution. For at least the next year she can probably maintain control over the situation without resorting to the kinds of blatantly illegal <pb n="5" xml:id="d208-05" facs="d208-05"/>actions that might turn the bulk of the Congress Party, her political base, against her. Her party's strong legislative majority would enable her legally to amend the constitution to strengthen the executive branch further; there are some reports that she may even do this in the parliamentary session that begins July 21. Moreover, we do not believe the Supreme Court's decision on her recent conviction for campaign violations (see discussion below) will make it necessary for her to step outside the law to remain in power. In addition, under present circumstances potential challengers within the party, as well as their supporters, would probably face immediate expulsion from the party and possible arrest.</p>
                        <p>4. Although their activities thus far have been limited and ineffective, opposition groups may try periodically to mount protest demonstrations and strikes in the months ahead. Such activities will probably be concentrated primarily in states where the opposition parties are relatively strong, such as Tamil Nadu (formerly Madras), Bihar, and Gujarat. Student protest efforts, moreover, may increase with the reopening of schools this month. The death of one of the detained opposition leaders — particularly the popular Narayan, who is in his seventies and in frail health, or former deputy prime minister Morarji Desai — could also touch off new demonstrations and might politicize many who have not yet formed an opinion on <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s recent actions.</p>
                        <p>5. Opposition efforts, however, will continue to be limited by the government's use of emergency powers, which has removed many potential protest leaders from circulation and intimidated others. Even if <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> decides to release some or all of the jailed leaders, they will continue to be inhibited by her ability to rearrest them at any time. Protests will also be obstructed by censorship of the press, which restricts public knowledge of developments that reflect poorly on the government and also limits awareness of provocative events such as hunger strikes by opposition leaders.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d208-06" facs="d208-06"/>
                        <p>6. A few state governments that are not controlled by the Congress Party, such as the regimes in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, may prove unwilling to do much to help the central government enforce the state of emergency. In Tamil Nadu, the state's Chief Minister and other officials have criticized <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s recent actions, and newspapers there have violated the censorship rules. New Delhi, however, could constitutionally impose direct central control on recalcitrant states and has enough force at its disposal to keep the situation in such states from becoming unmanageable.</p>
                        <p>7. India's economic problems, moreover, do not appear likely to worsen enough during the next twelve months to trigger widespread disorders. The important summer monsoon thus far has been good. Moreover, the government has announced a number of new economic measures whose impact will be limited but which will help to maintain public support in the short run.</p>
                        <p>8. The government can probably contain the level of unrest we anticipate. The state of emergency, which gives the government expanded powers of arrest and detention, is likely to remain in force for some time. Even without the emergency powers, however, the police, paramilitary, and — if needed — military forces could keep the expected protest activity from getting out of hand. These forces are likely to retain their traditional loyalty to civilian authority unless <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> flagrantly violates the constitution — a step we believe she will find unnecessary.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">The Court Case</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> is unlikely to step down or be forced out of office before the Supreme Court reaches a decision on her court case. The court reconvened on July 14 to consider the case; oral arguments are scheduled to begin on August 11. The final decision probably will be reached by late summer or early fall. Although all the members of the Supreme Court were appointed by <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, the court will probably try to maintain its traditionally independent image. In addition to confirmation or reversal of the lower court verdict, another <pb n="7" xml:id="d208-07" facs="d208-07"/>possibility is a qualified decision such as voiding her 1971 reelection but not holding her personally culpable for the alleged campaign violations. Such a ruling would deprive her of her seat in parliament but permit her to remain in office up to six months before having to seek reelection.</p>
                        <p>10. If the lower court conviction is upheld, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> could nevertheless remain legally in office. She could ask the Election Commissioner, a <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> appointee, to waive the requirement that she step down. Or she could ask the parliament, where her party has a strong majority, to amend the law so that her conviction would not require her removal from office. We believe she might well pursue one of these courses. The bulk of her party would probably support her. Many party members — and much of the Indian public — probably still regard her as India's most qualified leader and are convinced that the nation needs a strong hand at the center. They also share her view that the offenses of which she was convicted are too petty to warrant her removal from office. Dissenters within the party, we believe, would probably be intimidated into acquiescing.</p>
                        <p>11. If <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> left office, however, her most likely successor would be either of two cabinet members, both in their sixties — Agriculture Minister Jagjivan Ram or Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Y. B. Chavan</persName>. Others who have been mentioned as possible successors include Defense Minister Swaran Singh, Congress Party President D. K. Barooah, Minister of Railways Kamlapati Tripathi, and West Bengal Chief Minister S. S. Ray. Ram or <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> would probably be somewhat less leftist-oriented than <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">The Next Elections</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, in our judgment, will remain reluctant to cancel the next national elections. Their timing, however, will depend on her reading of the mood of the country. If her economic programs succeed in revitalizing <pb n="8" xml:id="d208-08" facs="d208-08"/>her own and her party's image, and if the nation remains relatively calm, we believe she may well schedule general elections by next March, the normal constitutional deadline. Otherwise she will probably postpone them, perhaps for a considerable period. She can do this legally while a state of emergency is in force.</p>
                        <p>13. The Congress Party's chances of retaining a parliamentary majority in the next elections are good whether the party is led by <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> or someone else. Congress presently holds a two-thirds majority in the more important lower house of parliament. It might lose some seats, but unless it lost more than 85 it would still retain a majority in a newly constituted 540-member lower house.</p>
                        <p>14. The impact on the electorate of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s recent repressive moves cannot yet be judged but will probably be less damaging among the vast number of people living at subsistence levels than among members of the relatively small middle and upper classes. Although her government's popularity has declined since 1972 because of worsening economic conditions and the government's disappointing performance, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> is still India's most widely known politician and the Congress remains the only truly national party, deeply embedded in all levels of government and society. Her name and family heritage will probably continue to attract sizable support, particularly in rural areas where most Indians live.</p>
                        <p>15. Opposition leaders would probably be released and press censorship eased before elections, although perhaps only shortly prior to the polling date. The opposition's freedom of action, however, would probably be circumscribed; the state of emergency, which we believe would be retained, would enable the regime to reimpose restrictions on opposition activity at any time.</p>
                        <p>16. Collectively, the opposition parties have always won a majority of the popular vote in national elections since independence. They represent such diverse ideologies and are so fragmented, however, that they have <pb n="9" xml:id="d208-09" facs="d208-09"/>never achieved a proportionate representation in the national parliament. Although the opposition parties defeated the Congress by combining forces behind single candidates in last month's state elections in Gujarat, they will probably continue to find it difficult to cooperate with one another in national elections.</p>
                        <p>17. If Congress, under <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s leadership, were to win only a plurality in the elections, she would probably try to form a government with the parliamentary support of the small pro-Moscow Communist party. If Congress suffered such a loss, however, Gandhi would come under increased pressure from the party to step aside. If Ram or Chavan replaced her, the Congress Party would probably look first for support from independents and defectors from the opposition, and a new effort might be made to reunite the two wings of the Congress Party, separated since 1969. Any such attempt to reabsorb the members of the Organization Congress could well result in a new crisis, with Gandhi's leftist supporters threatening to defect from the present party.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>18. An increase in internal unrest under <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s rule probably would lead her to seek diversions by dramatizing, as she has in the past, both internal and external threats, including alleged threats from the United States. She might be tempted to action of some sort, such as advancing the date of a second nuclear test. She probably would not actually shift her position on any important international issues, including policies toward the Soviet Union or other major powers.</p>
                        <p>19. There will be growing uneasiness in Islamabad that India may resort to aggression against Pakistan in an effort to divert the attention of the Indian public. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> may consider this, particularly if she comes under heavy domestic pressure. On balance, however, <pb n="10" xml:id="d208-10" facs="d208-10"/>we believe that such action is unlikely. Pakistan, for its part, might be tempted to capitalize on Indian domestic problems by starting new troubles in Kashmir or elsewhere, but we think such actions are also unlikely. Pakistan so far has taken a very restrained public stance regarding Gandhi's recent moves, as have Bangladesh and Nepal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">…If Gandhi Leaves Office</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. Replacement of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> as prime minister by another Congress Party leader probably would not lead to any major realignment in India's foreign relations. A successor might be somewhat friendlier than <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has been toward the US and China but would probably continue to maintain close ties with the Soviet Union. He would carry forward the <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> administration's efforts to establish closer links with Iran and the Arab states. Normalization of relations with Pakistan would continue to be pursued, but would also continue to be hindered by mutual distrust and by the difficulty of resolving remaining issues such as the Kashmir dispute.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">The Longer Range Outlook</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>21. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s prospects beyond the next year will depend principally on the economy, which in turn depends in part on the vagaries of the weather. Economic success would tend to drown out criticism of her authoritarian regime. Monsoon failures, and the inability of the government to get the economy moving, however, could lead to serious unrest and instability, particularly in the politically volatile urban areas.</p>
                        <p>22. In the latter event, labor might well defy the ban on strikes, and students could be expected to take to the streets despite the prohibition on demonstrations. Increased use of the security forces — possibly eventually involving use of the armed forces as demonstrations became more severe — would cause new tensions among government and Congress Party leaders. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, at this point, might well implement even <pb n="11" xml:id="d208-11" facs="d208-11"/>more sweeping controls and repressive measures in an effort to retain power. She could, for instance, abolish all political parties except for the Congress. She might succeed once again in cowing all opposition by her determined action, but not without running a greater risk of causing some of her opponents to resort to violence. This could create a situation in which events might get out of hand and ultimately lead to general instability.</p>
                        <p>23. Much would depend on the reaction of senior members of the Congress Party and on the leaders of the armed services. Growing dissatisfaction within the Party might eventually overcome fear of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> and result in agreement among party leaders that she must be replaced for the good of the party and of the nation.</p>
                        <p>24. Perhaps at least as likely as <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s removal by her colleagues within the party would be a sudden move by the armed forces to assume power. We believe such action would come only if the country appeared on the verge of chaos. If a decision were made to move against the prime minister, the action presumably would be portrayed as returning the country to its constitutional framework and would be accompanied by promises of an early return to democratic, civilian government.</p>

                                <p>BEGIN MESSAGE:</p>
                                <p>DEAR MR. PRIME MINISTER:</p>
                                <p>SINCE I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU PLAN TO VISIT SAUDI ARABIA THIS COMING MONDAY, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF REPORT ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATIONS. SINCE COMING TO THE AREA, I HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THE INTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS IN AN EFFORT TO HELP EGYPT AND ISRAEL ACHIEVE A FURTHER INTERIM AGREEMENT WHICH WOULD, IN OUR VIEW, CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD THE JUST AND LASTING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHICH REMAINS OUR OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE. THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT. THE ISRAELIS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MILITARY AND STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PASSES AND OIL FIELDS IN SINAI IN CIRCUMSTANCES <pb n="2" xml:id="d209-02" facs="d209-02"/>WHERE AN END TO BELLIGERENCY AND PEACE STILL LIE IN THE FUTURE. THE EGYPTIANS, FOR THEIR PART, ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ENTERING POLITICAL UNDERTAKINGS THAT ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE TO THE ARAB WORLD GENERALLY IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MUCH OF THEIR AND OTHER ARAB TERRITORY REMAINS OCCUPIED AND THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF THE PALESTINIANS REMAIN UNFULFILLED. DESPITE THESE POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS ON BOTH SIDES, I BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS AND THAT THE CHANCES FOR ACHIEVING THIS AGREEMENT ARE GOOD EVEN THOUGH A NUMBER OF OBSTACLES REMAIN TO BE OVERCOME AND A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION IS NOT YET FULLY ASSURED. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IN PARTICULAR THAT PRESIDENT SADAT HAS APPROACHED THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH GENUINE STATESMANSHIP, AND THAT WE HAVE HAD HEARTENING SUPPORT FROM OUR SAUDI FRIENDS.</p>
                                <p>I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS CONCERN IN THE ARAB WORLD THAT THIS AGREEMENT, IF ACHIEVED, WILL LEAD TO DIMINISHED INTEREST IN FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS FOR AN OVERALL SETTLEMENT OF ALL ASPECTS OF THE ARAB-ISRAELI PROBLEM. IT IS OUR FIRM INTENTION, HOWEVER, THAT THERE MUST BE ON-GOING NEGOTIATIONS — HOWEVER DIFFICULT THEY WILL BE AND HOWEVER MUCH TIME THEY MAY TAKE — WITH RESPECT TO THE SYRIAN AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM. OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS REQUIRE NOTHING LESS. I AM CERTAIN THAT THE SAUDI LEADERS WOULD BE ASSURED BY ANY ENCOURAGEMENT YOU COULD GIVE THEM. THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE DETERMINED TO PURSUE THIS EFFORT, AND, DESPITE SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE ARE EXPERIENCING AT HOME, I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE AMERICAN CONGRESS AND PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT OUR PEACE EFFORTS AND OUR POLICIES OF STRENGTHENING RELATIONS WITH OUR ARAB FRIENDS. THE VERY ACHIEVEMENT OF A NEW AGREEMENT SHOULD HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ATMOSPHERE AND, IF II IS SCRUPULOUSLY IMPLEMENTED AND OBSERVED, CAN BROADEN THE BASIS OF CONFIDENCE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR BOTH SIDES TO TAKE THE HARD POLITICAL DECISIONS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED AS THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS GOES FORWARD IN THE MONTHS AHEAD.</p>
                                <p>I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TAKE THIS OCCASION, MR. PRIME MINISTER, TO TELL YOU HOW PLEASED THE PRESIDENT AND I WERE TO HEAR FROM YOU IN YOUR LETTERS OF JUNE 13 REGARDING YOUR CONCERNS FOR PAKISTAN'S SECURITY. I REGRET THAT <pb n="3" xml:id="d209-03" facs="d209-03"/>THE DEMANDS OF THE MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATIONS HAVE DELAYED MY SENDING YOU A CONSIDERED RESPONSE BEFORE THIS. I HAVE DISCUSSED YOUR LETTERS IN DETAIL WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HE HAS ASKED ME TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR CONCERNS. IT WAS WITH THESE IN MIND THAT THE PRESIDENT ORDERED THE LIFTING OF THE EMBARGO ON ARMS SALES TO PAKISTAN LAST FEBRUARY. WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP MEET YOUR FOOD AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS IN THE YEAR AHEAD. THIS IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO ASSURE PAKISTAN'S CONTINUED SECURITY AND WELL-BEING. I HAVE AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">BYROADE</persName> TO CONVERY OUR VIEWS ON VARIOUS SPECIFIC POINTS YOU RAISED IN YOU EARLIER LETTER.</p>
                                <p>IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MY DEPARTURE FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, THE PRESIDENT SHARED WITH ME YOUR AUGUST 17 LETTER TO HIM, RE-EMPHASIZING YOUR CONCERNS IN THE CONTEXT OF RECENT CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN YOUR REPRESENTATIVES AND SOVIET DIPLOMATS IN KABUL. UPON MY RETURN TO WASHINGTON, I WILL DISCUSS THIS SUBJECT WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND HE WILL, OF COURSE, BE RESPONDING TO YOU. MEANWHILE, I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE SEEKING CLARIFICATION FROM THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STATEMENTS MADE BY ITS OFFICIALS IN KABUL, AND I HOPE YOU WILL KEEP AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">BYROADE</persName> INFORMED.</p>
                                <p>WARM REGARDS,</p>

                                <p>WE WERE PLEASED TO NOTE THE PRIME MINISTER'S EXPRESSION, IN HIS JUNE LETTERS, OF CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR THE SIMLA PROCESS. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED THE WISE POLICIES OF CAUTION AND RESTRAINT SHOWN BY THE GOP DURING THIS DELICATE PERIOD OF DIFFICULTIES IN INDIA.</p>
                                <p>IT IS OUR VIEW THAT CONTINUED PROGRESS UNDER THE SIMLA PROCESS WILL REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF RENEWED HOSTILITIES ON THE SUBCONTINENT. THE IMMEDIATE INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES, AND ONE WHICH WE FULLY SHARE WITH PAKISTAN, IS TO AVERT SUCH AN EVENTUALITY. IT WAS WITH THIS OBJECTIVE IN MIND THAT THE SECRETARY CONVEYED TO FOREIGN MINISTER GROMYKO IN MAY THE SERIOUSNESS WHICH THE UNITED STATES WOULD REGARD AN INDIAN ATTACK AGAINST PAKISTAN. WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP HAS FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES ON THIS QUESTION.</p>
                                <p>DIRECT INVOLVEMENT BY THE SOVIET UNION AND CHINA IN A SOUTH ASIAN CONFLICT WOULD, OF COURSE, HAVE IMPLICATIONS OF THE GRAVEST NATURE AND WOULD BE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE UNITED STATES. THE RESPONSE OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE A MATTER FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE EXECUTIVE <pb n="5" xml:id="d209-05" facs="d209-05"/>BRANCH IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH THE CONGRESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR CONSTITUTION AND OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 1959 MUTUAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH PAKISTAN.</p>
                                <p>THE PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY ARE HOPEFUL THAT THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD TALKS IN PEKING WITH LEADERS OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA LATER THIS YEAR. THESE TALKS WOULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE FULL RANGE OF SECURITY ISSUES AFFECTING RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES AND PAKISTAN, AND WAYS IN WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT MIGHT CONTINUE TO ASSIST PAKISTAN IN ITS EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN ITS SECURITY.</p>
                                <p>THE SECRETARY WAS MOST APPRECIATIVE THAT MR. <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> HAS COMMUNICATED TO THE CHINESE OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECT WHICH THEIR PROPAGANDA HAS ON OUR ABILITY TO MOBILIZE DOMESTIC SUPPORT FOR THE PRC'S SECURITY.</p>
                                <p>IN DISCUSSING YOUR LETTERS IN WASHINGTON, I FOUND A DEEP AND CONTINUING INTEREST IN THE ADMINISTRATION IN PAKISTAN'S SECURITY AND WELFARE, AND A STRONG DESIRE TO BE HELPFUL IN WAYS THAT ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS.</p>
                                <p>AS I KNOW YOU ARE AWARE FROM YOU OWN DISCUSSIONS WITH AMERICAN LEADERS, INCLUDING SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN, THE UNITED STATES IS NOT ABLE TO UNDERTAKE ADDITIONAL FORMAL SECURITY COMMITMENTS, OUTSIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF OUR FORMAL TREATIES AND EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS.</p>
                                <p>WITH REGARD TO THE RECENT STATEMENTS MADE BY SOVIET REPRESENTATIVES TO PAKISTANI OFFICIALS IN KABUL CONCERNING THE DURAND LINE, IF THESE IN FACT REPRESENT A CHANGE IN SOVIET POLICY TOWARD PAKISTAN, WE WOULD OF COURSE VIEW THEM WITH GRAVE CONCERN.</p>
                                <p>WE WILL BE INTERESTED TO HAVE YOUR FURTHER VIEWS ON THE SOVIET POSITION, FOLLOWING YOUR FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH SOVIET REPRESENTATIVES.</p>

                                <p>IN ADDITION TO THE SUBSTANTIVE POINTS ABOVE, YOU SHOULD SEEK TO CORRECT THE DIFFERENCES WHICH EXIST BETWEEN WHAT I SAID TO <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> IN ANKARA ON MAY 22 AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE REMARKS CONTAINED IN <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S LETTERS OF JUNE 13. THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE MADE SO THAT THE RECORD WILL BE CLEAR:</p>
                                <p>DURING MY WASHINGTON CONSULTATIONS, I REVIEWED THE MINUTES OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> AND SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>. OUR RECORD CONTAINS SOME IMPORTANT NUANCES WHICH IF NOT PRECISELY GRASPED, COULD LEAD TO MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH WE BOTH WANT TO AVOID.</p>
                                <p>THE SECRETARY INFORMED <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> HE HAD TOLD THE SOVIETS THAT WE WOULD HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE MADE OF THEIR EQUIPMENT ANYWHERE, AND ESPECIALLY IN PAKISTAN.</p>
                                <p>(<persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT STATES: “DR. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> INFORMED MR. <persName>AHMED</persName> THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO …. GROMYKO IN VERY STRNG TERMS TO THE EFFECT THAT AN INDIAN ATTACK ON PAKISTAN WITH SOVIET EQUIPMENT WOULD INVITE A RESPONSE FROM THE UNITED STATES.”)</p>
                                <p>THE SECRETARY ASKED <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> IF WE COULD ASK THE CHINESE WHAT THEIR RESPONSE WOULD BE IF PAKISTAN IS ATTACKED. THE SECRETARY ALSO INDICATED THAT A GENERAL WAR FOLLOWING AN INDIAN ATTACK ON PAKISTAN AND INVOLVING THE SOVIETS AND CHINESE WOULD HAVE THE GRAVEST IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WHOLE OF ASIA AND FOR U.S. POLICY IN THE AREA. (<persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S LETTER TO THE SECRETARY STATES: “….I WAS RELIEVED TO HEAR FROM MR. <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName>…WHAT YOU PLANNED TO TELL THE CHINESE ABOUT THE ACTION THE UNITED STATES WOULD TAKE IF THE SOVIET UNION ATTACKED CHINA FOR COMING TO PAKISTAN'S ASSISTANCE IN THE EVENT OF AN INDIAN ATTACK ON PAKISTAN.” <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT STATES: “DR. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> …ADDED THAT, IF CHINA POSED THE COUNTERQUESTION AS TO WHAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD DO IN SUCH AN EVENT AN ATTACK ON PAKISTAN), IT WOULD BE INFORMED THAT IF INDIA ATTACKED PAKISTAN AND CHINA CAME TO ITS HELP AND IF IN CONSEQUENCE THE SOVIET UNION ATTACKED CHINA, THE <pb n="7" xml:id="d209-07" facs="d209-07"/>UNITED STATES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STAY OUT OF THAT SITUATION.)</p>

                            </hi>: Congratulations on your success in the Middle East. It must have been tough.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: It was rough but not nearly as rough as since I came back. We are in a nihilistic phase of Congressional behaviour. Of course, they are hurting themselves by this since the really damaging thing politically would be to attack the Administration on domestic policy rather than foreign policy. What do they think they are doing? In any event, I am relaxed since this cannot last.</p>

                            </hi>: Look at the investigation of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and everything else.</p>

                            </hi>: It is typical of this stage of nihilism. I have refused to allow them to call up Foreign Service Officers to testify on what their policy recommendations were. This would be like the McCarthy period. My decision will cause a tremendous brawl.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: They are on the third list; we have the Pershing on the second list.</p>

                            </hi>: The Pershing issue is a big fraud. We never had any intention of giving it to Israel in any foreseeable time frame. The people who are pushing all this are the pro-Israelis who want to lock us into commitments to Israel. But you didn't want it anyway.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: The 1960 models are in surplus now so we should be able to give you some—but I had better watch what I say since there is no telling what you might report back to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>.</p>

                            </hi>: We will find it from Saudi Arabia. But we think it will be easier to get answers first from you on just what is available and how much it costs. Then we can go to the Saudis.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: I can inform you that we have approval to supply you with 24 TOW launchers and 450 missiles. You can get started on a training program while awaiting delivery of the rest. It is our intention to start slowly on our new military relationship with you, concentrating on defensive weapons, and get it going well before it can <pb n="3" xml:id="d210-03" facs="d210-03"/>be disrupted. So let us not give any publicity to the TOW's or the invitation we are extending to your Air Marshal. Let us build up slowly but steadily—with maybe some artillery next—weapons that can reasonably be described as defensive.</p>

                            </hi>: We have been very careful in compiling our lists.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: If you narrow the gap with India to 1 to 10 you will be in good shape. Seriously, we want you strong enough so that India will be afraid to attack.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We want A-7 and other weapons in a hurry. India might well attack us the 2nd or 3rd week of November in Kashmir.</p>

                            </hi>: Can they really attack there? I thought the terrain was too rugged, and it would seem as aggression anyway.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: According to the Indian Constitution, all of Kashmir is part of India. We can take them on in Kashmir but they will fight us all along the border. We cannot be certain but we think this will happen and we must look out for it. If it happens, it will be a two-front war with Afghanistan joining in anytime there is war with India. But we can handle this with the A-7.</p>

                            </hi>: It has very long range and is an attack plane, isn't it?</p>

                            </hi>: Yes. Are you saying it is not considered defensive? It is a fighter as well.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: We have been very interested in this plane for a long time. We want about 110 of them. We also need weapons in a short time frame since ordinary delivery will never get them in our hands before the war in November. We will do our best by ourselves but we need arms. It all depends on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Indians cannot move without Soviet approval because of their treaty which obliges the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to help India.</p>

                            </hi>: The treaty is not so binding.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: Yes it is since if India is attacked, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is obliged to come in until the threat is removed. Really, this would bring the Soviets in even if India went first and we hit back. So whenever India wants to start something, she must have Soviet support. We think India will probably start a war. Mid-November to mid-December is the probable time. This year is unlikely, but we must be watchful, and next year is more certain. If we seem to be in trouble, the Afghans will join in. We have told our chaps to be ready to do their best on two fronts and not to expect anyone to come to their help. Outside help is a bonus and they should not count upon it. Iran could stop the Afghans by moving some of its units up to the borders but it would not do so for fear of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. So what they will really do to help us is questionable. Nor have we been able to get China to assure us of support. That is why we need weapons off the shelf.</p>

                            </hi>: We have serious problems with our own army on rapid delivery. Don't you have a team coming soon? We can discuss all this when they come in October.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Thank you. That is the best approach. Also, concerning the soviet threat, you know about the Soviet Ambassador in Kabul. When <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> had the Soviet Ambassador in Islamabad in to ask about this, he had us all present. The Soviet Ambassador said he would report immediately to Moscow and was sure it would be cleared up soon. He would let us know. But he has never returned. When our Ambassador to Moscow took it up there, the Foreign Ministry expressed surprise that we would credit any such statement. But when our Ambassador asked the Soviets about the Durand line, they said they were “not empowered” to discuss borders. It is not conclusive but it is very worrisome and worthy of note. We have informed you and the Iranians and the Chinese.</p>

                            </hi>: As I told you in Ankara, we would take a grave view of Soviet machinations and you can be certain that the Soviets understand that. The Indian Foreign Minister will be in Washington next week and I will tell him that any Indian pressure on Pakistan will ruin Indian efforts at friendlier relations with the United States. They are trying hard to improve their relations with us at the present time, due to their internal developments. It is nothing spectacular, but it is interesting.</p>

                            </hi>: An agreed minute of the Joint Commission meeting, words but no real substance. The biggest question concerning the visit is whether I will be able to survive a dinner given by Ambassador YAQUB's colleague, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>. He insists upon making some sort of comment about each of his guests after dinner, and since he takes at least half a minute for at least forty guests, that is already twenty minutes and then he gives a long toast in which he attacks United States policy. It is very boring. The last time I was at one of his affairs he gave a toast saying that some nations like economic power and some like military power but India likes spiritual power. I replied that I was surprised that he came out with spiritual power since I had expected him to say India has chosen nuclear power. In <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s recent letter to President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> he said that Pakistan may have to adjust its policy to meet the political realities in the area. What does that mean?</p>

As you know, they have been very cautious and patient on this issue but for the first time I detected a bit of impatience. In the past he has always said he appreciates the problems of the United States. This time he did not say that and he hinted that China is impatient. But they clearly want to continue to have good relations with you.</p>

On this subject, I notice that your Prime Minister is excited over the visit by President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>. You know we never set a date for the visit and whether or not President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> visits Pakistan is not dependent upon what he does with India. We have a special relationship.</p>

                            </hi>: This was never planned and I cannot imagine how anyone got this idea. You know how the Chinese are. Certainly we would never consider going to India or even to Pakistan in connection with a visit to China. It has always been seen as a separate trip. The President may visit Southeast Asia after China, perhaps the Philippines. They need to be shored up after what happened in Indo-China. Is it true that you are buying arms from North Vietnam?</p>

                            </hi>: We have made some inquiries but there is nothing definite. The article in Newsweek saying we are interested in buying arms from North Vietnam upset them very much although the leak did not come from us. We have no details of what they can supply and we have made no decision but we are checking. It appears that almost everything belongs to South Vietnam. We shall have to see what happens.</p>

This has been fixed but it now turns out that the river bed has been scarred by closing the tunnels and this must be repaired. This means a delay in refilling the reservoir with a subsequent loss of water for irrigation. We had been counting on a good crop this year, especially for wheat, in 1976 but it now looks as if we shall have to wait for another year. Can you help us with more PL 430 wheat?</p>

                            </hi>: They appreciate realism. It is good to tell them that they have nothing we want. If they don't deal with us, they will be stuck with the Russians and this makes them uncomfortable. On aid, if we do it, it is O.K. but if it falls apart on the Hill, this will be embarrassing.</p>

If we do it, we should put together a program that looks like it is really humanitarian. I would like to hook it to food. They need grain storage capacity badly. We could help build some storage facilities in the ports where they are importing U.S. food.</p>

Therefore, if our interest is humanitarian and we want to sell grain, what better way than through developing better terminal facilities?</p>

                            </hi>: Perhaps we will be able to find time to talk further tomorrow if we are unable to complete our discussions today.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Yes.</p>

                            </hi>: I really welcome this opportunity to meet again and continue the exchanges we began in Delhi. Basically, we have many common points of interest and no clash <pb n="2" xml:id="d212-02" facs="d212-02"/>of national interests. While differences arise, these are because of differing geographic locations and geo-political positions. At least we can analyze and understand these differences. They should not come in the way of strengthening relations. The differences should not be blown out of proportion. I can tell you that we greatly appreciate your efforts for detente, the way you have defused so many crises, including Vietnam, Helsinki, and the Middle East. You have a deep perception of the problems and the consequences of the potentially disastrous effects of modern technology and war. We appreciate this because our policy has the same basic directions. We believe coexistence is necessary. It is not an accident that we appreciate your efforts. Both India and America have a basic interest in peace, stability and cooperation in economic matters. This should give a broader base for relations whatever differences may arise. At the Joint Commission meeting you rightly said that India was a major potential economic power. We think we can help other developing countries. Also, our basic policy is not chauvinistic. We don't want to disrupt people, we want to live at peace with our neighbors. Our interests correspond with those of other mature powers. When you make a basic assessment of India, I hope you will understand the forces that underlie our policy. In this connection, especially our role as a member of the Non-Aligned.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: You belong to the largest block that exists. We are jealous.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: We use our position in a constructive manner. We are a force for moderation in the Non-Aligned. You must have noticed that in Lima we were a moderating element on Puerto Rico and the Middle East. The role of India in the Non-Aligned is constructive. I hope the U.S. takes note of this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We agree that the U.S. and India share an interest in peace, stability and economic progress. I see no sign of clashing interests. In fact, since we have no clash of interest, our relationship should be cooperative, recognizing that each country has <pb n="3" xml:id="d212-03" facs="d212-03"/>its own geo-political position. Therefore, there will not be total congruence but we should be able to handle differences privately through dialogue. We appreciate your position on Puerto Rico. We have expressed some concern about the tendency toward block rigidity in the Non-Aligned but we have no complaints in recent months about India's position. We don't expect you to agree with all U.S. positions. I thought the Seventh Special Session had a moderating effect.</p>

                            </hi>: We were shocked by what happened. We expressed our sorrow about the killing of Mujib and his family but we have treated this as an internal matter. The new President has sent us assurances that he was standing by the same policy but we are concerned, in particular, whether the new government will take an extreme Islamic posture. This would create problems for the minority in Bangladesh. If the Hindus again feel insecure, there might be a new wave of refugees.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Is there a large minority group in Bangladesh?</p>

                            </hi>: About 15%. It is a major factor. So far the new government has given assurances it would follow the same policy as Mujib, but we are naturally worried about the influence of Pakistan on Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What is your impression?</p>

                            </hi>: They have just announced diplomatic relations. This is a good thing. Even under Mujib we recommended this. We never wanted an exclusive relationship with Bangladesh. Our worry is only this: That they might try to give a different connotation to the situation by giving an Islamic twist to things. Also the Chinese recognized [Bangladesh] only after the coup. Frankly, we are worried. There are radical communist elements in Bangladesh which the Chinese might try to help. Here we hope the U.S. and India will have a common approach.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: As I said before, we believe India and Bangladesh require good relations. We have no interest in seeing Bangladesh as part of a complicated power game. This would be futile. Bangladesh should concentrate on economic development. To the extent we have influence there, we will encourage good relations with India. I had one talk with the new foreign minister and did not gain the impression he was antagonistic toward India.</p>

                            </hi>: He was in Yugoslavia as foreign minister. We expected him in Delhi. He has stayed on in Europe and we are not sure about his plans. Now talking about Pakistan, we are continuing our efforts toward normalization but the pace is limping and slow. We do not know what to do but we are patient. They do not miss an opportunity to stir up trouble. Regarding the Security Council race, they jumped in a month after we announced our candidacy. This is unnecessarily creating a bad atmosphere. If we had known they were interested, we would not have gotten into the race. It is too bad since this creates an atmosphere of confrontation. But our efforts will continue. Their emphasis seems to be in trying to get arms.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: As I said in India, we have no reason for upsetting the basic power relationships on the subcontinent.

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I am having lunch with the Soviet Ambassador and don't feel that they have an aggressive policy toward China. We are not going to fight a war for the benefit of any third country. Of course, if the Soviet Union attacks China, this would have a major impact on the world balance of power, but we <pb n="7" xml:id="d212-07" facs="d212-07"/>see no evidence of this. In Southeast Asia the Chinese are somewhat worried about having Indo-China dominated by Hanoi and Hanoi working with the Soviets against China. That is their problem, not ours. I once told an Indian friend, I think it was Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">Kaul</persName>, that Hanoi's neighbors had better enjoy U.S. involvement in Indo-China. We now have a general interest in the independence of the Indo-China states. We are willing to have talks with the Cambodians and I do not exclude talks with Vietnam. Our attitude on their <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership application is a special case, not a test case of our relations with Vietnam. We would just as soon see the states of Indo-China remain independent.</p>
                        <p>You asked whether China would deliberately try to create turmoil. I think there is a disparity between Peking's words and its deeds. In South Asia, they may decide to play games with Bangladesh. They look at India as an extension of Soviet policy. Our one common interest with China is that they not be taken over by a major country, including India (laughter). We do not coordinate our policy in South Asia with China. Whatever mischief they do in Bangladesh we will not know about it in advance.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: That is right. But we have never had evidence that the Soviets are trying to take over China. We have strongly discouraged any Chinese adventures. What I said about the Soviet attitude toward China also goes for a Chinese attack on India. We would look upon this with extreme disfavor.</p>

It is much more a state than South Vietnam. It seems to us wrong that a country like South Korea formally established since 1948 is excluded and that a country like South Vietnam, where one hardly knows who the leaders are, can come in.</p>

                        <p>The present situation in our country has been developing over the past two years. The minority was trying to make governing more impossible. For example, the opposition in the state governments was forcing people of my party to resign under threat of violence. They threatened to organize a transport strike, which would have shut down industry. They finally decided to decide the issue with violence in the streets to force the Prime Minister to resign.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister wanted cooperation from the opposition to face economic problems, like the 20 percent inflation we suffer from. As a matter of fact, our rate of inflation right now is zero, so she has been acting.</p>
                        <p>What she had to do was painful, but it was constitutional. It has turned out that the people wanted it and wondered why it wasn't done before. They welcomed it. Strikes are gone, industrial production is up, and we are prospering. Of course, some political figures had to be detained, but very few of them. Only those who were inciting to violence, and so forth.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The President</hi>: I am sure you understand that the people in my country judge standards of democracy by their own experience. so we have to judge by one's standards. We have had mobs in the streets, too. If your constitution permits such actions, we can understand. I was saddened by the riots we had a few years ago. I meant no disrespect by my words but I was commenting on the basis of the standards in our country.</p>
                        <p>I hope your Prime Minister understands that we judge by our traditions. I hope it will not affect our good relations in any way. We look forward to working with you in the Joint Commission and as a leader of the nonaligned.</p>

                            </hi>: Oh, yes, in the south they drink coffee.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Parthasarathi</hi>: They grow very good coffee in Madras, but it is made differently than in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What do they drink in Kashmir?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">T.N. Kaul</hi>: Fresh air and love.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: They have a special kind of green tea in which walnuts and safron are also mixed. It's very good.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: There is one point I want to make. We have very significant cooperation going forward with Iran. We are making good progress. These projects call for long-term cooperation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We are trying to encourage Iran in this direction. We are also trying to urge them to develop a fertilizer industry for the whole Indian Ocean area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: The Iranians have mentioned the idea of an Indian Ocean community, something like the Common Market, but this needs to have all the countries of the area in it, including Pakistan and Afghanistan. It's an interesting idea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What is your view of the Pakistan-Afghanistan relations?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: Pushtunistan is still a problem. Afghanistan feels that Pakistan is creating problems by trying to stir up subversion. They have a genuine concern. We are advising patience and restraint. They are also in touch with the Iranians.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: That is good advice.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">T.N. Kaul</hi>: Is anybody suggesting that the Pakistanis show restraint?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Could your Ambassador be instructed to say one unaggressive sentence?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: We told the Afghans that they should try to solve their problems with the Pakistanis. Recently they complained about some sort of Pak effort to stir up some insurgency. Our advice is to continue dialogue and to work for peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: In China will you take up the question of Asian peace? This is a matter of concern to us as it should be to you.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d214-03" facs="d214-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: It is. We certainly will let you know our view of the Chinese assessment. We will tell your Ambassador. We will not give any encouragement to any Chinese aggressive move. We will try to get a clearer picture of how they view South Asia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: We are worried about Bangladesh. Radical movements are already there. If Pakistan and China converge their efforts, this could pose a problem. This would be a new factor in South Asia which needs assessment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We will discuss it. Naturally it will come up. Previously the Chinese were opposed to Bangladesh. They were not among Mujib's admirers. Do we know who the Bangladesh new foreign minister represents? Is he a policy maker or simply carrying out orders? I made it clear when we talked that we favor good relations with India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: He also made this point to me.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What is his background?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: He was the first President of Bangladesh and then became their ambassador to Switzerland after Mujib took over the presidency.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: At the very end he became minister of shipping under Mujib but never actually took over the job.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Did you have any advance indication of the coup?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Singh</persName>
                            </hi>: None.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: People are always complaining that we don't know about things in advance. This is coming up now in Congressional hearings. They should realize that any coup that succeeds must have fooled someone. Mujib just couldn't have imagined that anyone would organize a coup against him. As I understand it, your relations with Bangladesh are now good. What you are concerned about is a future possibility.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: Yes, our relations are now good. The new government has reaffirmed various agreements on problems like our boundaries and the Farakka Barrage.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">T.N. Kaul</hi>: The danger is Pan Islamism.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We may become allies yet.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">T.N.Kaul</hi>: We are the third largest Muslim country. What is a Muslim country?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Don't ask me that question. I can't help you. I don't know what a Muslim country is but whatever it is I don't think India qualifies, but I agree this is a long-term problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">T.N. Kaul</hi>: Especially when people like Qaddafi are sending money to arm people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: What about Amin?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: He is a Muslim and Islam is proselytizing most of Africa. In fact, it is the most active proselytizing religion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>
                            </hi>: But they are the ones that sold the Africans into slavery.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: The real worry would be if countries with resources like Saudi Arabia get radical leaders. Then there would be trouble.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">T.N.Kaul</hi>: One reason why we banned the Jamaat Islami and RSS is that these parties were getting money from the outside.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Let me say again how happy we are to have you here. Are there any other subjects you want to raise?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>
                            </hi>: Well, we covered most of the subjects yesterday. But the Indian people would expect me to mention the Indian Ocean. If I don't mention it the meeting would not be complete.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: In that case, can I say something also about nuclear proliferation? (Laughter)</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Yes, but I think it is important to take advantage of opportunities like this.</p>
                        <p>Please give my regards to the Prime Minister. I think things have been moving well since February. I have looked over the military equipment — the TOW, etc., — that is being discussed, and I feel this carries out my determination which I conveyed to the Prime Minister in February. Your Air Force Chief of Staff is coming soon.</p>

                            </hi>: The Indians are sending a purchasing mission here to buy radios. I didn't want you to read it in the papers.</p>
                        <p>

                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: What about recent developments in Bangladesh?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: It is a useful development. The Bengalees are very emotional people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Was there any warning?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: None whatsoever. They have been sending messages they want to get closer to us. We are telling them to be cautious; we don't want to upset India or the Soviet Union. But there are no problems and things will move forward.</p>
                        <p>With India, there was a lot of noise when your arms policy changed. Indira is making noises about Pakistan being a threat and being surrounded on three sides — by us, China and Diego Garcia. Much of this is just posturing but we couldn't ignore it. Then came the emergency. We anticipated that would happen. But before and after we got hints from places like Australia and Japan that India might make a move against Kashmir this winter. Then came the emergency. But the rumors persisted. There isn't much we can do about it. We are grateful to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for his representation to the Soviet Union. About all we can do is build up our military. We wouldn't mind a conflict confined to Kashmir — we would do o.k. But it wouldn't be restricted to Kashmir but would spread all down the border.</p>
                        <p>There still are vitriolic radio attacks against us. Our assessment is that if war happens — and we think it will eventually ….</p>
                        <p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: We are lucky the Indians are pacifists. [Laughter]</p>

                            </hi>: We think next time Afghanistan will join in. They kept out before — and they claimed credit for it — but we won't be so lucky a third time. Daoud is able but half-mad, cruel and ruthless. Things inside Afghanistan don't look too good.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: Didn't I read about some governmental change in the last week or so?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: I don't think so, but there is substantial opportunism. At one time Afghanistan indicated a willingness to talk with us and said they had no designs on our territory — they only wanted the Pushtuns and Baluchis protected. He had agreed to come to Pakistan, but then one of our governors was killed by someone who fled to Afghanistan. We decided to ban <pb n="3" xml:id="d215-03" facs="d215-03"/>that party. It had been bad for years and this was the last straw. Afghanistan then refused to talk with us until the ban was lifted and the leaders released. We couldn't do that. The case is now before our Supreme Court. So we refused, and that is where we are now. We can't accept such demands.</p>
                        <p>We don't consider the Afghan threat serious, but coupled with the Indian one and supported by the Soviet Union, it is a serious problem. We hope to get some defensive equipment from you before then.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: What would China do?</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We asked them and they haven't really answered. They said we would have to talk at the appropriate time. I said that is not helpful. Our military need to plan and must know now, not if a war starts. If they are going to move, we have only about 30 days within which China could help; after that the Passes are closed.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: The Indians agreed to put back into the formal note the term “by peaceful means” which had been dropped from the earlier version.</p>

                            </hi>: I think there isn't much chance of attacking you. I was worried about Bangladesh. What we might see is refugees from Bangladesh stimulated by India and then the Indians use the pretext of the refugees to intervene.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We told the Bengalees not to give them any pretext. To take care of the Hindus and not antagonize Indira or the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The incalcuable factor in the whole situation is the Soviet Union. Their strategy is inscrutable but we think their objectives are clear.</p>

                            </hi>: The shortest way to the Gulf is through Pakistan. One way or another they want to get across and eventually to control the Gulf area. Iran has agreed to help us but they can be bypassed. They had been stalling but now are agreeing to fund some purchases. Without the Soviet green light, the Indians won't attack. The last time the Soviets did help India.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes, and actual help. During the night they would fly in, fire weapons and flee. So this is one problem. If you could help us and give us equipment from stocks and not make us wait 2-3 years. We know it is difficult, but we do need it right away.</p>

So we have jacked up our wheat deficit and think we'll need 1.5 million tons from outside. You have been kind giving us 50,000 tons, but anything you can do will be appreciated.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes. It was very positive. We talked about your situation, and they are still concerned. We told them we would begin selling increased amounts of arms to you. They wanted us to sell you A-7s. We told them someone would be coming over. Their concern for India seems the same.</p>

It was put in pleasant terms, of course — praising the Prime Minister's policy of noninterfering. It seemed what they were trying to do was convey a message to China that China should keep out of it.</p>

                            </hi>: I warned the Bangladesh people in New York to be careful about this. Our Ambassadors are ready to go. There is already agreement on both sides. This could provoke India.</p>
                        <p>One problem is overflights over each other's territory. It's tied up with a case we have tied up in ICAO, a case against India. They said we had to withdraw it. We said to them we couldn't withdraw it because we couldn't explain it to our people, but we wouldn't revive it.</p>
                        <p>I'll see <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName> tomorrow. I'll tell him the ball is in his court. Now that we've restored relations with Bangladesh, they are showing no interest in allowing overflights. This is what we suspect.</p>

                        <p>ON MY PART TO THE PM AND THOSE IN CONTACT WITH HER WHICH PUTS THE QUESTION, “WHY SHOULD WE BE HELPFUL WHEN YOU DISTRUST US AND BLAME US FOR YOUR PROBLEMS?” THIS I WILL DO.</p>
                        <p>4. I AGREE WITH THE SLOW-DOWN IN HANDLING OF PL480 AND DIRECT AID. WE SHOULD NOT ENTIRELY CUT OFF OUR OFFER OF AID, WHICH WOULD RECALL OUR CONFRONTATION IN 1971, BUT SHOULD INSTEAD DELAY NEGOTIATIONS IN <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1976 UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE DATE AND THEN OFFER A “DISAPPOINTINGLY” SMALL AMOUNT (PERHAPS 10-20 MILLION). I ALSO SUGGEST WE BE MORE AGGRESSIVE ON PANAM QUESTION AND AIR INDIA'S LANDING RIGHTS IN US. IF JOINT SUBCOMMISSIONS ARE TO MEET, KEEP US PARTICIPANTS AT LOW LEVEL, DROP OUT CONCLUSIONS, LIMIT COMMITMENTS, ASK HARD QUESTIONS AND DEMAND FIRM ANSWERS.</p>
                        <p>5. AS TO THE IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS, I HAVE ASKED SENATOR MCGOVERN AND HE HAS AGREED TO ASK THE PM IN A PRIVATE MEETING TOMORROW FOR SPECIFIC INCIDENTS OF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> INTERFERENCE IN INDIA'S AFFAIRS AND TO TAKE THE POSITION THAT AS A LONG-TIME FRIEND OF INDIA HE IS GREATLY DISTRESSED AT GOI ATTITUDE IF WE ARE BEING USED IN A GAME OF “DUCKS AND DRAKES.” WE SHALL REPORT ON HIS MEETING.</p>
                        <p>YM I AGREE THAT OTHER DIRECT AND STRONGER MEANS WOULD NOT ACHIEVE OUR PURPOSE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF UN-FRIENDLY TALK; BUT THERE ARE SUBTLE MEANS OF GETTING THE MESSAGE ACROSS THAT UNTIL SUCH UNJUSTIFIED ATTACKS ARE BROUGHT TO A HALT INDIA CAN EXPECT LITTLE OR NOTHING FROM USG. THIS APPROACH WILL FAIL, HOWEVER, IF EFFORTS CONTINUE TO GIVE INDIA EVERY POSSIBLE BREAK IN TRADE ACCOMMODATION, AIRLINE MONOPOLY AND EASY EXCHANGE OF S&amp;T KNOWLEDGE. THE STATE DEPARTMENT MUST INSIST THAT ALL CONTACTS FOR BENEFITS TO INDIA MUST CLEAR THROUGH IT AND VERY DELIBERATELY SET A POLICY OF RESTRAINT AND CAUTION. THEN IF WE FIND THAT MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> DOESN'T CARE, WE CAN FURTHER CUT BACK ON WHAT WE ARE DOING ACCORDINGLY.</p>
                        <p>7. WHEN I RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS I WILL SEEK AN EARLY APPOINTMENT WITH <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName>. THERE HAS BEEN NO FORMAL REQUEST FOR CONTINUATION OF SITE, ONLY CASUAL SUGGESTIONS, SO I WILL NOT RAISE THIS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY MAKE A REQUEST.</p>

                        <p>PROTEST TO <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> JANUARY 15 OVER MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S UNWARRANTED CRITICISMS OF U.S. AND <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">SAXBE</persName>'S LETTER OF JANUARY 21 ON THE “PATRIOT” EDITORIAL. IF INDIA HAS ANY SPECIFIC CHARGES AGAINST US, THESE SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S STATEMENTS MAKE US WONDER IF GOI WANTS CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THERE</p>
                        <p>IS NOT SUFFICIENT BASIS OF MUTUAL TRUST TO DISCUSS AN AID PROGRAM IN <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76 AND THAT WE WOULD DEFER TALKS ON AID UNTIL <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 77. ON THE SITE PROJECT, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> GAVE KAUL LETTER STATING IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO EXTEND PROJECT AS REQUESTED. WE INTEND, HOWEVER, THAT JOINT SUBCOMMISSION ACTIVITIES SHOULD GO FORWARD. WE WILL NOT MAKE PUBLIC ISSUE OF UNFAIR INDIAN ATTACKS. CONCLUDING HIS REPRESENTATION, SISCO STATED THAT HIGHEST LEVELS OF USG WANT GOI TO UNDERSTAND THAT GOOD RELATIONS MUST BE A TWO-WAY STREEET. THE DECISION IS UP TO INDIA.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> RESPONDED BY STATING <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> IS SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING GOOD RELATIONS WITH U.S. AND TRIED TO PUT MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S STATEMENTS IN “PERSPECTIVE.” HE EMPHASIZED THAT HER STATEMENTS WERE MADE AT A PARTISAN POLITICAL MEETING AND THAT SHE WAS SIMPLY WARNING HER PEOPLE IN A GENERALIZED WAY (WITHOUT REFERRING BY NAME TO ANY COUNTRY) TO BE VIGILANT. <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> THEN MADE VAGUE REFERENCES TO U.S. INTERFERENCE IN BANGLADESH, AND HE ASSERTED THAT OVER PAST 20 YEARS U.S. HAS BEEN INTERFERING IN SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS, CULMINATING IN 1971 “TILT” TOWARD PAKISTAN. REVERTING TO GOI POLICY TOWARD <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, HE MENTIONED RECENT FRIENDLY STATEMENTS BY BOTH PRESIDENT <persName>AHMED</persName> AND MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> ACKNOWLEDGED U.S. RIGHT TO MAKE ANY DECISION ON AID BUT REGRETTED LINKING THIS TO BILATERAL POLITICAL RELATIONS. HE PARTICULARLY REGRETTED OUR DECISION ON SITE PROGRAM. <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> WAS UNINFORMED ABOUT “PATRIOT" EDITORIAL BUT DENIED IT REFLECTED <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> POLICY.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> ACKNOWLEDGED GENERALIZED NATURE OF MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S REMARKS IN CHANDIGARH BUT STATED THAT THERE WAS NO MISTAKING U.S. WAS MEANT. HE TOOK NOTE OF FRIENDLY STATEMENTS BUT REMARKED THAT UNSUBSTANTIATED CHARGES OF U.S. INTERVENTION MADE “MOCKERY” OF THESE.</p>

                        <p>5. ON <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName>'S VAGUE REFERENCE TO BANGLADESH, SISCO REITERATED THAT, IF <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS CHARGES AGAINST US, IT SHOULD SPECIFY THEM. THE SECRETARY TOLD <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">CHAVAN</persName> IN PARIS THAT WE ARE NOT “PLAYING AROUND IN BANGLADESH.” HOW CAN WE SAY IT MORE CLEARLY? ALL OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN TO PROMOTE GOOD BANGLADESH-INDIAN RELATIONS. AND NOW THE INDIANS ARE MAKING MORE UNSUBSTANTIATED CHARGES. “WE CATEGORICALLY DENY THEM.” <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> SAID THAT WE CAN ONLY CONCLUDE THAT OUR WORDS HAVE NOT BEEN HEEDED, WHICH HAS LED TO A “DETERIORATION OF OUR CONFIDENCE” IN THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. A CONSTRUCTIVE AND COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP CANNOT BE MAINTAINED UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. KAUL SAID HE THOUGHT WE WERE BEING</p>
                        <p>“UNFAIR” AND “UNREALISTIC” AND EXPRESSED REGRET AT CURRENT SITUATION. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> ENDED CONVERSATION BY ALSO EXPRESSING REGRETS. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>

                            <item>AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN MAKING IT CLEAR TO ALL THE SENIOR INDIANS I HAVE BEEN SEEING THAT IMPROVEMENT IN INDO-US RELATIONS JUST CANNOT TAKE PLACE WHILE THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHER HIGH INDIAN LEADERS CONTINUE TO POKE AWAY AT THE US. I APPRECIATE THE TOUGH PARALLEL LINE TAKEN BY JOE SISCO WITH AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KTN1">KAUL</persName> IN WASHINGTON. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EFFECT OF ALL THIS WILL BE. INDIA CERTAINLY HAS AN INTEREST IN GETTING THE THINGS FROM US IT NEEDS. THE POINT I AM TRYING TO GET ACROSS IS THAT THESE MAY NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE IF RELATIONS ARE BAD. I DO NOT ASK FOR MUCH; I WOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY IF MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> WERE SIMPLY TO IGNORE THE US.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>MY REASON FOR WRITING NOW IS TO EXPLAIN WHY I AM PURSUING THIS HARD LINE. IT IS NOT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE HAVE SO LITTLE INTEREST HERE THAT WE SHOULD NOT CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN INDIA AND THE REGION GENERALLY. IT IS IN FACT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME THINGS OF IMPORTANCE TO US HERE AND PURSUING A HARD LINE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY TACTICS WHICH STAND ANY CHANCE OF GETTING US WHAT WE WANT. MY POINT IS WE STILL WANT STABILITY IN INDIA AND STABILITY IN THE REGION. WE STILL WANT AN INDIA WHERE THE RUSSIANS AREN'T IN CONTROL. WE STILL BELIEVE INDIA WILL BE IMPORTANT TO US AS A MODERATE LDC IN THE ONGOING INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEBATE.</item>

                            <item>CONSEQUENTLY, IT SEEMS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE NOT COMPLICATE THE EFFORT WE ARE MAKING IN INDIA BY SHIFTS IN RELATIONS WITH INDIA'S NEIGHBORS WHICH THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT SEE AS THREATENING. OUR PROBLEMS WITH MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> AND HER GOVERNMENT ARE SERIOUS BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY BILATERAL. AND IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE I THINK TO COMPOUND THEM BY BRINGING IN ELEMENTS SUGGESTING A CHANGE IN THE WHOLE US POSITION TOWARD THE SUBCONTINENTAL AREA.</item>

                            <item>AT EVERY CROSSROADS IN THE PUNJAB THERE IS A SHERMAN TANK AS A CONSTANT REMINDER THAT THE US WAS INDIA'S ENEMY IN THE PAST. IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO ADD ARMS ON THE PAKISTANI (OR BENGALI) SIDE WHICH WOULD ONLY DECORATE MORE CROSSROADS IN THE FUTURE. WE ARE TRYING TO GET MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S ATTENTION BY THE TOUGH BILATERAL LINE WE ARE TAKING. WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, WANT TO TOTALLY CONCENTRATE OUR FOCUS AND FACILITATE HER DOMESTIC POLITICAL PROBLEMS BY PROVIDING REAL AMMUNITION FOR HER TO USE AGAINST US ON THE SUPERSENSITIVE ISSUE OF INDIAN SECURITY AND HER RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN, BANGLADESH AND NEPAL.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>I AM SURE THERE WILL BE ISSUES OTHER THAN ARMS THAT RAISE THE SAME QUESTION—THINGS WE WILL BE TEMPTED TO DO FOR OUR FRIENDS, THE PAKISTANIS AND BENGALIS. THE BENGALI EFFORT TO GET US TO HELP THEM GET RID OF A TROUBLESOME GENERAL (NURUZZAMAN) IS A CASE IN POINT. I HEARTILY AGREE WITH THE WAY WASHINGTON IS HANDLING THIS ONE. I DON'T INTEND TO COMMENT ON EACH ONE OF THESE THINGS AS THEY COME UP BUT THOUGHT IT WORTHWHILE TO ELABORATE ON THE POLICY I AM FOLLOWING HERE.</item>

                            <item>UNDER SECRETARY CONVEYED FOLLOWING POINTS:
<list>
                                    <item>— THERE IS INCREASING APPREHENSION IN THIS COUNTRY AND ELSEWHERE OVER ACQUISITION BY GROWING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OF <pb n="2" xml:id="d224-02" facs="d224-02"/>SENSITIVE NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS NUCLEAR FUEL REPROCESSING.</item>
                                    <item>— WE HAVE WELCOMED AND TAKEN SERIOUSLY PRIME MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S ASSURANCES LAST YEAR HERE IN WASHINGTON THAT PAKISTAN WOULD NOT MOVE TOWARD DEVELOPMENT OF A NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. WE BELIEVE THAT YOU AND WE SHARE A STRONG INTEREST IN AVOIDING ACTIONS WHICH COULD CAST DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF OTHERS ON THESE ASSURANCES.</item>
                                    <item>— IN THIS REGARD, THE EFFORTS OF THE PAKISTAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION TO ACQUIRE A REPROCESSING PLANT FROM FRANCE IS CAUSING US SOME CONCERN.</item>
                                    <item>— IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO FIND AN ADEQUATE ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION FOR A NATIONAL REPROCESSING FACILITY IN YOUR COUNTRY. PAKISTAN'S PRESENT SINGLE POWER REACTOR RUNS ON NATURAL URANIUM FUEL AND THUS DOES NOT UTILIZE REPROCESSED FUEL.</item>
                                    <item>— EVEN THOUGH STRINGENT SAFEGUARDS MAY BE APPLIED, PREMATURE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A SENSITIVE NUCLEAR FACILITY INEVITABLY WOULD GIVE RISE TO PERCEPTIONS BY OTHER NATIONS THAT NON-PEACEFUL USES MAY BE CONTEMPLATED. WHETHER JUSTIFIED OR NOT, SUCH PERCEPTIONS TEND TO BE DESTABILIZING AND THEREFORE ARE OF GREAT CONCERN TO US. IN SAYING THIS, SISCO EMPHASIZED THAT HE WAS NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLYING THAT WE HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT ASSURANCES THE PRIME MINISTER HAS GIVEN US.</item>
                                    <item>— WE WOULD HOPE THEREFORE THAT PAKISTAN WOULD GIVE THOUGHT TO THE POSTPONEMENT OR CANCELLATION OF PRESENT PLANS TO ACQUIRE A REPROCESSING PLANT UNTIL PAKISTAN'S FUTURE NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED TO ESTABLISH CLEAR. NEED AND UNTIL OTHER ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN MORE THOROUGHLY EXPLORED.</item>
                                    <item>— WE ARE ALSO FRANKLY CONCERNED THAT PAKISTAN IS NEGOTIATING TO ACQUIRE AN INDIGENOUS HEAVY WATER PRODUCTION CAPABILITY FROM FRG. WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND TECHNICAL OR ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS FACILITY, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF PAKISTAN'S APPARENT INTENTION TO BUILD ONLY LIGHT <pb n="3" xml:id="d224-03" facs="d224-03"/>WATER REACTORS IN FUTURE. PAKISTAN'S APPARENT EFFORT TO ACQUIRE COMPLETE, INDIGENOUS NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE IS OPEN TO MISINTERPRETATION AND QUESTION, AND SPECIFICALLY THAT HEAVY WATER PLANT WOULD BE OPEN TO SUCH MISINTERPRETATION AS WELL AS THE REPROCESSING PLANT.</item>

                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE</p>
                        <p>WASHINGTON</p>
                        <p>March 19, 1976</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I am writing to you in the spirit of friendship and mutual understanding which has traditionally characterized exchanges between our two Governments. During your visit to Washington last year, we held very productive discussions and reached broad areas of understanding on matters of mutual interest. I am encouraged by the openness of our relationship to approach you quite candidly on Pakistan's plans to acquire certain sensitive nuclear facilities, a matter which is of deep concern to my Government.</p>
                        <p>I know from my discussions with you that you share our fear over the threat to the general peace posed by the unrestrained spread of nuclear explosives technology. My Government has welcomed your forthright assurances that Pakistan will not divert its civil nuclear development efforts into an explosives program, and that Pakistan's nuclear activities will be devoted exclusively to peaceful purposes.</p>
                        <p>You should be aware, however, that there is considerable apprehension in this country and elsewhere over the spread on a national basis of the nuclear technology associated with the development of nuclear explosives — specifically, uranium enrichment, heavy water production and chemical reprocessing. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly last September the view of this Government that the further spread of nuclear reprocessing facilities under national control would seriously aggravate the problem of nuclear proliferation.</p>
                        <p>For this reason we welcomed Korea's decision to forego acquisition of a national reprocessing plant. For the same reason I am now writing to you to ask that you give serious consideration to the broader implications of this matter for stability both in your region and in the world. At this juncture, <pb n="2" xml:id="d225-02" facs="d225-02"/>I believe your Government has an opportunity to make a highly important contribution to worldwide efforts effectively to forestall further nuclear proliferation.</p>
                        <p>My concern is not the reliability of the assurances of your Government. It is that the establishment of sensitive nuclear facilities under national control inevitably gives rise to perceptions in many quarters that, under circumstances which perhaps cannot even be foreseen today, non-peaceful uses may be contemplated. Whether justified or not, such perceptions could be by themselves destabilizing and undermine the mutual confidence and sense of security which must be created if we are to build a system of international peaceful nuclear cooperation.</p>
                        <p>These perceptions are heightened in Pakistan's case by the lack of a persuasive economic justification for obtaining sensitive nuclear facilities. For example, the experience of the United States, as well as of all countries with major nuclear power programs, is that reprocessing of spent reactor fuel is only economic within a very much larger reactor program than Pakistan could contemplate for the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>I know that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> has already expressed similar views to you on this matter, but I want to underline to you my deep personal concern over the possible effect of your actions in this area on our ability to sustain support in public opinion here for our close cooperation on a broad range of issues of interest to both our governments. I fear that many in this country will be critical of Pakistan's actions and skeptical regarding its intentions. Friendship with Pakistan has enjoyed broad popular support in this country among the public and in the Congress over the years. However, Pakistan's acquisition of these sensitive facilities would, I believe, arouse considerable criticism and could erode this support.</p>
                        <p>With these considerations in mind, I hope that you will give serious consideration to foregoing present plans to acquire reprocessing and heavy water facilities until your future nuclear program is sufficiently developed to establish a clear need and until other alternatives, such as a multinational venture, are thoroughly explored.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d225-03" facs="d225-03"/>
                        <p>I believe that I understand the difficulties that my request to you will present to your Government. I would not raise this matter with you, however, if I did not consider it to be of the utmost importance. I would be grateful if you would let me have your views on the points I have raised.</p>

                            <item>AS MY MESSAGES HAVE SUGGESTED, I HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT UNTIL NOW TO COMMENT IN ANY COMPREHENSIVE WAY ABOUT THE INITIATIVES THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN TO DETER PAKISTAN FROM MOVING FURTHER TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NUCLEAR OPTION. THIS UNCUSTOMARY HESITANCE ON MY PART IN SPEAKING OUT ON AN ISSUE SO CENTRAL TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PAKISTAN HAS STEMMED LARGELY FROM MY APPRECIATION BOTH OF THE POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION PROBLEM AND OF THE INEVITABLE COMPLEXITY OF ANY STRATEGY WE CAN DEVISE TO ATTAIN OUR GOAL OF LIMITING THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONRY. CABLE TRAFFIC WE'VE RECEIVED HERE ABOUT OUR VARIOUS APPROACHES AND MY OWN EXCHANGES WITH THE PAKS HAVE NOW MADE THE NON-PROLIFERATION LANDSCAPE CLEARER, AND I FEEL I MIGHT PROFITABLY WEIGH IN WITH SOME THOUGHTS AS I SEE THE SITUATION DEVELOPING FROM MY ISLAMABAD VANTAGE POINT.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT OF COURSE SEEN THE TEXT OF <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName>'S REPLY TO THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER, WHICH I UNDERSTAND AMBASSADOR YAQUB EXPECTS TO PASS TO YOU WHEN HE RETURNS TO WASHINGTON THIS WEEK, I THINK THERE <pb n="2" xml:id="d226-02" facs="d226-02"/>IS LITTLE REASON TO EXPECT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE AS RESPONSIVE AS WE WOULD WISH TO THE CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED TO HIM. UNLESS I AM WRONG, THE REPLY, COMING IN THE WAKE OF THE NEGATIVE FRENCH REACTION TO OUR DEMARCHE ON THE NEGATIVE FRENCH REACTION TO OUR DEMARCH ON THE REPROCESSING PLANT, WILL IN EFFECT BRING TO AN END THE FIRST “EASY” PHASE OF THE EXERCISE TO LEAD PAKISTAN AWAY FROM THE NUCLEAR OPTION PATH. AS WE MOVE AHEAD TO CONSIDER FRENCH OPTIONS IN DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM, I BELIEVE IT IMPORTANT THAT WE EXAMINE OUR PRIORITIES REGARDING PAKISTAN MORE CLOSELY THAN WE WERE PERHAPS ABLE TO DO IN THE HURRIED EFFORTS TO GET TO THE PAKS, FRENCH, GERMANS BEFORE THE TRILATERAL SAFEGUARDS WERE APPROVED AND THE PAK-FRENCH AGREEMENT SIGNED.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE MUST DETERMINE ANSWERS TO THREE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS BEFORE WE CAN DEVISE ANY COHERENT STRATEGY IN WORKING TOWARDS OUR GOALS HERE. THEY ARE (1) HOW REALLY IMPORTANT IS IT TO US IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL NONPROLIFERATION EFFORT THAT PAKISTAN BE CLEARLY SEEN TO HAVE ABANDONED ITS NUCLEAR OPTION; (2) WHERE DOES OUR EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT THIS PUBLIC SELF-DENYING ACTION ON THE <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>'S PART RANK VIS-À-VIS OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN; AND, STEMMING FROM THESE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS, (3) WHAT PRICE ARE WE WILLING TO PAY IN TERMS OF OUR BILATERAL TIES AND OUR APPROACH TO THE BROADER SOUTH ASIAN REGION TO BRING PAKISTAN AROUND. I FEAR THAT UNLESS WE COME UP WITH SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS WE COULD EASILY STUMBLE INTO DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONS WE COULD EASILY STUMBLE INTO DIFFICULTIES EVEN GREATER THAN THOSE WE ALREADY FACE IN DEALING WITH THE NUCLEAR PROBLEM HERE.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I CERTAINLY CANNOT SUGGEST ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANCE OBVIOUSLY GOING FAR BEYOND OUR LOCAL INTERESTS HERE. WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THIS MESSAGE IS TO OUTLINE FOR YOU SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS VARIOUS ANSWERS MIGHT HAVE FOR US IN PAKISTAN AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REGION.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>I THINK THAT AT THE VERY ONSET WE HAVE GOT TO <pb n="3" xml:id="d226-03" facs="d226-03"/>ASSUME THAT IF WE CONCLUDE THAT PAKISTAN MUST BE SEEN TO HAVE GIVEN UP ITS NUCLEAR OPTION AND THAT THIS AIM IS OF OVERRIDING IMPORTANCE IN OUR PRIORITIES HERE THEN WE ARE GOING TO FACE SOME VERY TOUGH DECISIONS IN WASHINGTON. I BELIEVE THAT ALL EVIDENCE WE'VE SEEN SO FAR INDICATES THAT BHUTTO INTENDS TO KEEP HIS NUCLEAR OPTION OPEN—YOU KNOW HIS REASONS—AND THAT IT WILL BE VERY COSTLY TO GET HIM TO DO OTHERWISE, PARTICULARLY IN WHAT PROMISES TO BE AN ELECTION YEAR IN PAKISTAN.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>I KNOW THAT YOU WILL PE EXAMINING A SERIES OF OPTIONS DESIGNED TO PERSUADE <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> TO CHANGE HIS MIND — IF THAT IS INDEED WHAT WE HAVE DETERMINED WE MUST DO—AND THAT AMONG THESE WILL BE ONE OUTLINING A SUCCESSION OF SUBTLE AND MORE OBVIOUS PRESSURES WE CAN BRING TO BEAR ON THE PAKS. HOWEVER ADVISABLE OR EVEN NECESSARY THIS APPROACH MAY POSSIBLY SEEM IN TERMS OF CONGRESSIONAL ATTITUDES, AND THE IMPACT IT MAY BE THOUGHT TO HAVE ON NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS AND THRESHOLD COUNTRIES, I DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK. MY JUDGEMENT IS THAT <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> IS MOST UNLIKELY TO BE BROUGHT AROUND BY THREATS AND PRESSURES, WHETHER THESE ARE DIPLOMATICALLY PHRASED IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS ON THE HILL OR PUT IN THE MORE DIRECT LANGUAGE OF NEGATIVE LINKAGE TO ONGOING OR ANTICIPATED ECONOMIC AID AND MILITARY SALES PROGRAMS. (I DON'T QUESTION THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF CONGRESSIONAL FALLOUT. THE PAKISTANIS FOR THEIR PART MAY BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT ITS GENUINENESS AND MAY SUSPECT THAT THE EXECUTIVE INSTIGATED IT, BUT WHATEVER CONCLUSIONS THEY REACH THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO BE DETERRED.) ANY NUMBER OF SCENARIOS CAN BE PREPARED MAPPING OUT THE WAY THINGS WILL GO IF WE PERSIST IN THIS NEGATIVE APPROACH. IN MY VIEW THEY WILL ALL HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON: A SERIOUS DETERIORATION IN US-PAKISTAN RELATIONS COUPLED WITH FAILURE TO BRING THE PAKS AROUND. WE WILL HAVE GOT OURSELVES THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS.</item>

                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>INDEED, THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE PAKS PERSISTING IN ACHIEVING A NUCLEAR OPTION WILL PROBABLY BE INCREASED RATHER THAN DIMINISHED BY OUR TAKING THIS HARSH LINE WITH THEM. IF <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> IS AS DETERMINED TO GO AHEAD WITH A COMPLETE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE WE BELIEVE HE IS AND IF HE PERCEIVES THAT HIS POSSIBILITIES FOR OBTAINING AND PAYING FOR THE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS HE FEELS PAKISTAN NEEDS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY OUR ACTIONS, A NUCLEAR DETERRENT COULD BECOME AN EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE PROPOSITION FOR HIM. I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE WHAT THE INDIANS WOULD DO UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES— A PAKISTAN WITH LIMITED CONVENTIONAL MILITARY POWER SEEMINGLY GOING DOWN THE NUCLEAR ROAD— BUT IS CERTAINLY RELEVANT TO QUESTION THE EFFECT SUCH A SITUATION WOULD HAVE ON WHAT HAS UP TILL NOW BEEN OUR PRIMARY GOAL OF REGIONAL STABILITY.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>A MORE POSITIVE APPROACH HAVE BETTER PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS THAN THIS NEGATIVE NON-STARTER. BUT IN CONSIDERING THAT STRATEGY WE SHOULD NOT DELUDE OURSELVES ABOUT THE COSTS INVOLVED. THESE ARE LIKELY TO BE HIGH. THEY ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN THE COUPLE OF SQUADRONS OF A-7S I UNDERSTAND SOME IN THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED AS AN APPROPRIATE QUID PRO QUO, IF WE DECIDE THAT NON-PROLIFERATION <pb n="5" xml:id="d226-05" facs="d226-05"/>MUST BE GIVEN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WE WILL HAVE TO INVOLVE OURSELVES MORE DEEPLY IN PAKISTAN'S SECURITY CONCERNS THAN WE'VE BEEN WILLING TO DO BEFORE. (<persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> SUGGESTED AS MUCH IN WASHINGTON LAST FEBRUARY WHEN HE SAID FOR THE PRIVATE RECORD THAT “IN DEVELOPING ITS NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY, PAKISTAN WOULD NOT DIVERT ANY OF ITS URGENTLY NEEDED DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO THE EXPENSIVE EFFORTS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION (BEGIN UNDERLINE) PROVIDED ITS DEFENSE IN THE CONVENTIONAL FIELD IS ASSURED.”) (END UNDERLINE). WE WILL HAVE TO MOVE FURTHER AND FASTER IN OUR MILITARY SALES PROGRAMS THAN WE'VE BEEN PREPARED TO DO SINCE THE ARMS EMBARGO WAS LIFTED. WE HAD BETTER FACE THE FACT THAT THIS MIGHT EVEN INVOLVE OUR AGREEING TO SELL THE PAKS MEDIUM TANKS, THE NEXT MAJOR ITEM AFTER FIGHTER AIRCRAFT ON THE LIST OF EQUIPMENT IN WHICH THEY'VE SHOWN AN INTEREST. I'M NOT RECOMMENDING THAT WE GO THIS ROUTE, WHICH ASSOCIATES US WITH THE PAKS MUCH MORE CLOSELY THAN I HAVE THOUGHT APPROPRIATE, BUT IF WE ARE IN DEAD EARNEST ABOUT NON-PROLIFERATION WE MAY HAVE TO START DOWN IT AND BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES. (WHETHER CONGRESS WILL ACCEPT OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PRIORITIES INVOLVED AND ALLOW US TO DO SO IS A QUESTION YOU ARE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN I TO ANSWER.)</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>AMONG THESE CONSEQUENCES OF COURSE, WILL BE TROUBLE WITH INDIA. FOR ANY MEANINGFUL EFFORT TO SATISFY PAKISTAN'S SECURITY NEEDS IN THE CONVENTIONAL FIELD AS A MEANS OF HEADING OFF HER GOING THE NUCLEAR ROUTE WILL INEVITABLY PRODUCE AN ADVERSE REACTION IN DELHI (WHICH IS NOT LIKELY TO BE IMPRESSED BY THE NON-PROLIFERATION ARGUMENT) AND COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS IN OUR SOUTH ASIAN ARMS SUPPLY POLICY. OTHER GOALS WE SEEK IN THE REGION MAY BE ENDANGERED BY IN THE PROCESS. AGAIN IT IS A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>PERHAPS OUR BEST HOPE RESTS IN A COMBINATION OF POSITIVE MEASURES TO ENHANCE PAKISTAN'S SECURITY (AND TO PROVIDE BHUTTO WITH VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF OUR CONCERN FOR ENABLING HIM TO BE SEEN TO BE ACHIEVING THE <pb n="6" xml:id="d226-06" facs="d226-06"/>BASICALLY PHONY “ECONOMIC PURPOSES” HE CITES AS HIS OSTENSIBLE REASON FOR ACQUIRING NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY.) PARTICIPATION IN A MULTINATIONAL REPROCESSING FACILITY, SUGGESTED TO BHUTTO BY BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND YOURSELF, COULD BE SUCH A FACE-SAVING GAMBIT, WITH IRAN THE OBVIOUS PLACE FOR THE PLANT (ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD BE VERY HARD INDEED FOR <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> TO SWALLOW AT THIS LATE STAGE). I WOULD URGE THAT WE LOOK CAREFULLY AT THIS POSSIBILITY AND DO WHATEVER WE CAN DO INTEREST BOTH THE SHAH AND <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">BHUTTO</persName> IN IT. LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF FORESTALLING A NUCLEAR PAKISTAN, I WOULD HOPE THAT IF NECESSARY WE ADOPT AS FLEXIBLE AN APPROACH AS POSSIBLE, IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OTHER REQUIREMENTS, TOWARDS SAFEGUARDING SUCH A FACILITY.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>I HOPE THAT ALL OF THIS WILL BE OF SOME USE. IF I HAVE SKETCHED OUT MY PERCEPTIONS IN FAIRLY STARK TERMS IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE FACE A VERY A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION WHICH CALLS FOR SOME VERY FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS ON PRIORITIES AND THE STRATEGY TO BE PURSUED ONCE THESE ARE DETERMINED.</item>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for receiving me in the midst of your many preoccupations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Most of my preoccupations these days have to do with avoiding criminal charges.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: The Prime Minister asked me to convey his response to the President's recent letter. When the letter arrived, he was in the midst of an extensive tour of Baluchistan. The Prime Minister received the letter there and our response has been somewhat delayed due to his desire to study all aspects of the issue and to give the most careful consideration to this response. He asked me to deliver this letter personally to you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: May I open it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: (After reading text) Well, I would like to study this further. Obviously, the letter was drafted with great care. As I understand the last paragraph, you are willing to multilateralize your reprocessing plant. Are you willing to invite other countries to participate? What countries would you have in mind?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: Iran.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d227-02" facs="d227-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: How about Israel? You would get a lot of Congressional support if you would invite Israel to participate. Let me study this further.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: My second point pertains to a message for you from <persName corresp="#p_AA8">AZIZ AHMED</persName> which he asked me to handle personally. You may recall that during your meeting with the Prime Minister in New York we had spoken about the question of arms sales which are going ahead, but rather slowly. There have been some delays and probably some of them are due to our side. We are trying to see what can be done.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: (to Dubs) Are we sitting on anything? (to Ambassador YAQUB) I have the last vestiges of Protestant moralism working for me. They are always trying to block these things.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubs</persName>
                            </hi>: There have been some problems, mainly due to bureaucratic procedures. We are ready to move ahead on two letters of offer at the moment—the TOW sale and an ammunition order for $36 million.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: That's good.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Are these avoidable delays? What are your problems?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: There are these letters of offer which we have been expecting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubs</persName>
                            </hi>: There may be a problem with getting the various clearances that are required.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Who is holding this up?</p>

                            </hi>: <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> has been holding up a couple of Pakistani uses.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>. How does <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> get into this?</p>

                            </hi>: This is in conformity with the HUMPHREY Amendment in recent legislation which provides for an <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> role in all arms transfer cases.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What is <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>'s objection?</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d227-03" facs="d227-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PR6">Peck</persName>
                            </hi>: They have some general reservations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DA1">Dubs</persName>
                            </hi>: We are trying to iron this out with <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> through George Vest.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_VGS1">GEORGE VEST</persName> is working for me. Can I have a report on this by the end of the week?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: The final point I would like to make is a matter to which we attach very great importance. I believe the Prime Minister has already talked with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> regarding an agreement of mutual support and friendship which we want to work toward with Iran and Turkey. We want to discuss this at the RCD Summit which will take place toward the end of the month. This agreement would be meant to fortify the ties which already exist between our three countries. We are anxious to know your reactions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We would basically leave this up to you. We took some soundings in Iran and had the impression that they are not prepared to get into this, but we could be mistaken. We would have no objections. How would this differ from <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> has non-regional members.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Since we are all together in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, there is no reason for us to object to your having another link outside of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. We will not work against it. We cannot promote it and are not in a position to encourage the concept. I don't think India will be overjoyed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: India is already imagining that half of all the Iranian equipment is siphoned off to Pakistan and equipment from all sorts of sources is flowing into Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Do you think this will stimulate India to undertake a counter organization in some way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: Well, they already have a similar treaty with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We will not work against it and, if asked, we will say we have no objections. It is really up to you.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador YAQUB</hi>: This is a perfectly clear position and an understandable one. I will convey it to the Prime Minister. I would just like to convey the Prime Minister's own greetings to you and those of your many admirers in Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Give the Prime Minister my warm regards. I enjoyed seeing him in New York. It is always pleasant to meet with him.</p>

                            <item>—Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> is fully in control of political life in India and appears likely to face no serious opposition over the next one to three years.
<list>
                                    <item>—Most Indians seem to have accepted the national emergency proclaimed in June 1975.</item>
                                    <item>—Continued support for <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> will be heavily dependent on her ability to maintain sufficient food stocks, to control inflation, and to stimulate economic activity.</item>

                            </item>
                            <item>—<persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, aware that opposition is likely to mount if the emergency continues indefinitely, might ease some of the restrictions, though the basic authoritarian structure constructed since the emergency will probably remain.
<list>
                                    <item>—She might well choose to hold national elections later this year or in 1977 and the Congress Party<pb n="3" xml:id="d229-03" facs="d229-03"/> would almost certainly win overwhelmingly.</item>
                                    <item>—<persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has indicated some form of control over the press will continue indefinitely.</item>

                            <item>— India is likely to become more active in international affairs.
<list>
                                    <item>— <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> may try to reassert India's leading role in the non-aligned movement.</item>
                                    <item>— India will continue to have little tolerance for opposition to New Delhi's policies on the part of the smaller states in the region.</item>
                                    <item>— Relations with Bangladesh present the most likely source of trouble and Indian military intervention cannot be ruled out.</item>
                                    <item>— The re-establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan will improve communications between them, but relations will probably be cool and correct and interspersed with periods of heightened tensions.</item>
                                    <item>— Any major improvement in Sino-Indian relations appears to be a long-term proposition.</item>
                                    <item>— India will become somewhat less reliant on Moscow for military supplies but political ties will remain close.</item>
                                    <item>— Relations with the United States will probably remain restrained.</item>

                            <item>— New Delhi will almost certainly conduct additional nuclear tests, but the timing of such tests is uncertain, and we believe that no test is likely before this fall.</item>

                        <p>This memorandum is an attempt to describe the present political situation in India and to estimate what is likely to happen, both in domestic politics and foreign relations, over the period of the next one to three years. It discusses some of the factors underlying the widespread acceptance in India of the national emergency, proclaimed in June 1975, and the present impotence of the opposition to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>. At the end of the memorandum, we examine, briefly, what might happen in the event <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> were suddenly removed from the scene.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">The Present Internal Scene</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Government and Congress Party</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has fully established her dominance over the nation.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>—Within the cabinet, the two men once considered potential rivals of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Y. B. Chavan</persName> and Minister of Agriculture Jagjivan Ram, have been neutralized by <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s astute maneuvering.</item>
                            <item>—Within the Congress Party, the group of relatively young parliamentary members who, on occasion, criticized the prime minister and threatened to become an opposing bloc within the Party are now either in jail or silent.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s domination of the Party is exercised far beyond the capital. She has replaced those state chief ministers who had achieved independent bases of support with politicians of known loyalty. The last remaining chief minister within the Congress Party who could claim an independent power base was removed in 1975.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d229-05" facs="d229-05"/>
                        <p>— In early 1976 Gandhi eliminated the only two major state governments, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, not under rule of the Congress Party or its allies. Both states are now under direct rule from New Delhi.</p>
                        <p>3. In both government and party, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has made it clear that she wants individuals whose loyalty to her is beyond question.(<note n="*" target="d229fn*">[footnote] (*) Typical is the present Minister of Defense, Bansi Lai, who openly boasts that his Loyalty is not to the office of prime minister but rather to Gandhi as a person. D.K. Barooah, President of the Congress Party, is credited with originating the widely publicized slogan “Indira is India and India is Indira.”</note>) Development of a personality cult around the prime minister has been one of the more prominent features of the emergency. While not exactly alien to Indian tradition, it is at odds with the nation's political history since independence. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the leader of his nation for 17 years, but he rejected setting himself beyond criticism, fearing it would lead to dictatorship. During his years in power, he generally sought compromise rather than confrontation, urging on his countrymen “the politics of consensus.”</p>
                        <p>4. The prime minister relies for advice on a small group of confidants including her 30-year-old son, Sanjay. This inner circle is composed of bureaucrats and family retainers, reflecting the prime minister's general distrust of politicians who might one day challenge her control. Sanjay holds no position in the government and only recently was elected to the executive committee of the youth wing of the Congress Party. In this post he has traveled widely throughout the country and has already established a cadre of youthful supporters who apparently are intent on hitching their wagons to Sanjay's rising star. The prime minister has apparently encouraged the recent campaign to publicize Sanjay and present him to the nation as a potential successor.</p>
                        <p>5. The Military. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s government has maintained the loyalty of the military and the security forces during the emergency. The officer corps of the armed forces is highly nationalistic and traditionally apolitical. Some senior military officers <pb n="6" xml:id="d229-06" facs="d229-06"/>have privately applauded the greater sense of national discipline which exists under the emergency. The army would prefer not to participate in internal security operations, and Gandhi, cognizant of this, has thus far relied primarily on paramilitary forces. The government has ample well-trained and equipped paramilitary forces at its disposal for the maintenance of internal security. These include the Border Security Force (80,000), the Central Reserve Police (60,000), and the Provincial Armed Constabulary (242,000).</p>
                        <p>Supporters of the Emergency</p>
                        <p>6. There is widespread acceptance of the emergency.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>— The upturn in the Indian economy since the emergency was declared in June 1975, even though the emergency played only a minor role in it, has worked in <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s favor.</item>
                            <item>— The largest fall harvest in history, due to a good monsoon last year, combined with tight monetary policies started in 1974, have kept food available and prices down for urban workers.</item>
                            <item>— Many Indians applaud the government's energetic drive against economic crimes, such as hoarding and black marketeering, and its efforts to reduce corruption and improve the functioning of the civil service.</item>
                            <item>— Businessmen are generally pleased by the curb on strikes and by the government's relatively favorable action toward the private sector.</item>
                            <item>— The rural landlords are pleased by the government's emphasis on discipline and with the high priority accorded agriculture.</item>
                            <pb n="7" xml:id="d229-07" facs="d229-07"/>
                            <item>
                                <p>— The Indian peasantry, which makes up 80 percent of the population, has remained apathetic and fatalistic.</p>
                                <p>Opponents of the Emergency</p>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>7. Under the emergency, the opposition, both open and covert, operates under many constraints, none perhaps as limiting as the tight censorship of the media. By closely controlling the domestic press and radio, the government can insure that speeches by opposition members of parliament, proclamations by jailed leaders, mass demonstrations, or acts of sabotage will receive no publicity. As a result of this and other government policies, the opponents of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> are isolated, weak, and ineffective.</p>
                        <p>8. Opposition to the emergency comes largely from the following:
<list>
                                <item>— The numerically small intelligentsia, including most of the now muzzled Indian press; this is basically a non-activist opposition which criticizes, usually privately, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s actions.</item>
                                <item>— The universities, where there has been some open opposition — usually broken up quickly by the police; many student leaders and some faculty members have been intimidated and some jailed.</item>
                                <item>— The judicial system, particularly at the state level (the Supreme Court, in part reflecting Gandhi's use of her appointive power, has been relatively cooperative); <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has called for “basic reforms” in the legal system.</item>
                                <item>— Opposition political parties, many of whose top leaders are in jail; this source of opposition has been ineffective and many party <pb n="8" xml:id="d229-08" facs="d229-08"/>members have sought admission to <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s Congress Party.</item>
                                <item>— Some elements of the labor movement, many of whose leaders are in jail.</item>
                                <item>— Political prisoners (out of the estimated 70,000-100,000 persons believed jailed since the emergency, perhaps 20,000 purely political prisoners remain incarcerated).</item>
                                <item>— Underground opposition; despite minor acts of sabotage, the underground movement is presently insignificant.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Foreign Relations</p>
                        <p>9. In the foreign policy field, the emergency has permitted <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> to act more freely in the knowledge that there would be no criticism or demonstrations by opponents of her policies. This freer hand, for instance, has allowed her to move toward improved relations with China and Pakistan without the open denunciation by the leaders and newspapers of the Jana Sangh or other Hindu nationalist organizations that might well have occurred prior to last June.</p>
                        <p>10. China and Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s diplomatic initiatives toward these two neighbors, first taken in April 1976, are probably aimed primarily at demonstrating India's independence and refurbishing the nation's credentials as a truly non-aligned state in preparation for the Non-Aligned Summit in Colombo in August. (A few third world countries have criticized India's close ties to the Soviet Union — in particular, the Indo-Soviet Friendship Treaty of 1971.) Beyond this immediate goal, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> probably views improved relations with Peking, exemplified by the anticipated exchange of ambassadors after a lapse of 15 years, as useful in trying to limit Chinese diplomatic and material support for Pakistan and possibly as a means of neutralizing potentially unfriendly Chinese influence in Bangladesh.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d229-09" facs="d229-09"/>
                        <p>11. Agreement was reached with Pakistan in May 1976 to re-establish diplomatic relations, severed in 1971, to renew overflights and direct airlinks, and to restore rail communications between the two countries. New Delhi probably expects that normalization with Pakistan will help improve India's international standing, particularly among the Muslim nations, which have generally been sympathetic with Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>12. Bangladesh. Relations with Bangladesh have been less than cordial since the overthrow of the government of Mujibur Rahman in August 1975. Subsequently, Bangladesh's improved relations with Pakistan and China caused suspicion in India. Widespread popular and governmental distrust of New Delhi exists in Bangladesh, fueled by reports of Indian support for armed dissidents operating near the border and by India's action in diverting some water from the Ganges River upstream from the smaller country. Occasional fire-fights along the border have added to the tension despite agreement between the two nations to establish a joint border commission to investigate such incidents.</p>
                        <p>13. India appeared during the confusion that followed the second and third coups in Bangladesh last November to be seriously considering military intervention. Spokesmen in New Delhi then and since have repeatedly warned that if unrest in Bangladesh resulted in communal violence and a new horde of Hindu refugees fled across the border into India, as happened in 1971, Indian armed forces would intervene. Bangladesh leaders view the Indian threat seriously and have taken action to prevent communal clashes. Relations between the two countries remain cool and occasionally tense, but it appears that the government in New Delhi has concluded that the present regime in Dacca is the best that can reasonably be expected at this time.</p>
                        <p>14. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Relations with the Soviet Union remain close, based in part on New Delhi's present reliance on Soviet military and economic assistance but <pb n="10" xml:id="d229-10" facs="d229-10"/>also on general agreement regarding most important international issues. For their part, the Soviets openly praised <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s decision to impose the emergency last summer. They have instructed the Communist Party of India (CPI), an informal ally of Gandhi's, to continue to support the prime minister on most issues.</p>
                        <p>15. Differences between Moscow and New Delhi, however, have arisen on occasion. Repeated Soviet requests for Indian diplomatic support for an Asian collective security pact have been rejected in New Delhi, as have Soviet requests for permanent repair and supply facilities for naval vessels in Indian ports. The recent Soviet refusal to allow India to repair Egyptian aircraft was a blow to India's image as an independent leader of the non-aligned. Moscow has not made an issue over India's recent initiative toward China.</p>
                        <p>16. US. Relations between India and the United States have remained cool since imposition of the emergency. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has been bitterly resentful of American and other Western criticism of her repressive actions. Her occasional public attacks on the United States over such issues as “interference” in South Asia and creation of a “naval base” on Diego Garcia are in contrast with her government's quiet support of initiatives to improve bilateral economic and cultural relations. A consistent irritant in relations for the last two decades — Indian concern over the supply of American arms to Pakistan — was exacerbated by removal of the US arms embargo on South Asia in February 1975.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>17. For the short term, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> appears firmly in control of India. There are no viable alternatives to her. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> will continue her practice of removing from power anyone who appears to be developing <pb n="11" xml:id="d229-11" facs="d229-11"/>an independent power base. Over the longer range, through mid-1979, we expect her to retain power. Challenges against her, however, could arise if the agricultural situation deteriorated.</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> will continue to rely on her son, Sanjay, and a handful of relative unknowns for political advice. The rise to prominence of Sanjay has been one of the more remarkable developments during the emergency. We believe that he, encouraged by his mother, will exert increasing influence over domestic political developments. He is obviously being groomed for high office -possibly as eventual successor to his mother. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> must be aware, however, that her son's rapid rise to power has irritated many — both within and outside the Congress Party — and she will probably try to bring Sanjay along slowly. A seat in the next parliament is possible, although higher office within the Congress Party appears more likely. Conceivably, Sanjay may choose to retain only his present post in the youth wing of the Congress while gathering around him younger members of the party whose loyalty could be useful to him in a contest for power some years from now.</p>
                        <p>19. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> can probably count on the continued loyalty of the military and the security forces. The military will remain with her as long as:

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>We believe these conditions will be fulfilled in the time span of this memorandum.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d229-12" facs="d229-12"/>
                        <p>Support Dependent on Economy</p>
                        <p>20. Urban popular support for <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> will remain heavily dependent on her ability to maintain sufficient food stocks, control inflation, and stimulate economic activity. Thanks to the recent record-breaking food grain harvest and continued procurement of foodgrains from abroad, stocks of rice and wheat appear sufficient for the nation to survive at least one bad monsoon without serious food shortages or unduly high prices.</p>
                        <p>21. The Indian government's annual economic survey, supported to some extent by a recent World Bank report, is relatively optimistic about the present state and future trends of the economy. Much of the optimism is based on the estimated 114 million ton record harvest of foodgrains this crop year — as compared to 101 million tons last year.(<note n="*" target="d229fn*">[footnotes] (*) All tonnages used in this section are metric.</note>) Over the next few years, however, the government will have to press energetically for more irrigation, better seeds, and increased use of fertilizers and pesticides if it is to reach the World Bank projection of 125 million tons by 1978-79. India will also have to grapple with massive unemployment and underemployment in the cities, and in this area the prospects are not promising. Over the still longer term, government attempts to improve living standards of the people will be as dependent on efforts to increase agricultural production as on a decline in population growth rates.</p>
                        <p>22. Industrial production has increased during the past year,but much of the industrial sector remains sluggish and troubled, with many firms facing slack demand and increasing inventories. The budget for 1976-77 contains a variety of tax incentives and offers of direct governmental financial assistance which will probably facilitate some increased industrial production.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d229-13" facs="d229-13"/>
                        <p>23. The Indian balance-of-payments outlook is relatively good, assuming that net foreign aid continues at present levels of about $1.25 billion per year. Indian officials predict, somewhat optimistically, that because of recent petroleum discoveries in the Arabian Sea near Bombay total Indian production will increase from a million tons in 1975 to over 20 million tons by 1980. Moreover, coal production, which has increased from 78 million tons in 1973-74 to 98 million tons in 1975-76, is expected to reach 135 million tons by 1978-79. Both factors will decrease India's dependence on foreign oil. Although their ambitious energy goals may not be fully met, the increased production combined with anticipated increases in domestic supplies of nonferrous metals, steel and fertilizer could lead to a decrease in the large annual trade deficit that India has registered for the last three years.</p>
                        <p>24. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> appears likely to continue her program of publicly advocating socialist changes while attempting to stimulate the private sector of the economy with various incentives and a prohibition on strikes. Her long history of advocacy of socialism, however, could bring this program to an abrupt halt if the economy fails to respond. Sanjay, who boasts of advocating highly pragmatic policies to increase productivity, could be influential on his mother's thinking in this field. Businessmen have applauded the proposed budget for 1976-77.</p>
                        <p>25. Although some progress is likely, it is doubtful that India will make a major breakthrough in stepping up economic growth during the next several years. Much will depend on increased investment and a substantial boost in development expenditures. On balance, however, India's economy will continue to rely on its agricultural output, and despite some improvements in irrigation and increased use of fertilizer, the uncontrollable and unpredictable whims of the monsoons will be the critical factor.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="d229-14" facs="d229-14"/>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Possible Opposition</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>26. Organized labor, weak in India even before the emergency, can be expected within the next year to chafe under the ban on strikes and other labor agitation. Active resistance to the emergency appears unlikely, however, at least in the absence of a new round of inflation. Failure of the government to satisfy wage demands and prevent industrial layoffs at the high rate established in 1975 could cause isolated outbreaks of unrest.</p>
                        <p>27. Opposition to the emergency in rural areas is unlikely to develop into significant proportions, at least over the period of this estimate. Large landowners are nervous as a result of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s repeated calls for land reform but are encouraged by the history of government inaction that has accompanied such calls in the past. Small landowners and landless workers are unlikely to take an interest in politics but will become increasingly cynical if <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s repeated exhortations to her government to enforce her Twenty Point Economic Program comes to nothing. Rural violence, however, is likely to be isolated and thus pose no great threat to the government.</p>
                        <p>28. The small urban middle class and the intelligentsia will continue to furnish the majority of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s active opponents. Student opposition is likely to grow if the emergency is continued much beyond the end of this year. To be effective, however, student agitation would need allies within the ranks of labor or the bureaucracy — or even the police — and prospects for such help appear remote over the short term.</p>
                        <p>29. The opposition political parties, with the possible exception of the ideologically motivated Jana Sangh and Communist Party of India/Marxist, are unlikely to recover from the blows to their organizations administered under the emergency. Despite the obvious need for unity among the opposition parties, <pb n="15" xml:id="d229-15" facs="d229-15"/>the distrust stemming from ideological and personality differences will continue to make more than surface unity difficult to achieve. The movement of opposition legislators into the Congress Party can be expected to continue as individuals opportunistically seek to better their political fortunes.</p>
                        <p>30. There is only a slight possibility that the pro-Soviet Communist Party of India will abandon its de facto alliance with the Congress Party despite economic moves to the right by the government. Only economic chaos or a sharp turn away from socialism, improbable in the near term, would be likely to drive this faction of Communists into active opposition. Furthermore, pressure from Moscow will probably continue to be exerted on the Party to keep it allied with <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>31. The underground opposition may grow slowly in size and effectiveness over the next three years if the emergency is prolonged. Again, the economy will be instrumental in determining the future success or failure of an underground campaign. At present, the security and intelligence forces appear loyal to the government and adequate in size and training to contain any dissident movement.</p>
                        <p>32. Frustration and repression, nevertheless, could lead to an increase in the number of incidents of anti-government violence over the next few years. Among the politically conscious, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> is either idolized or hated; the emergency has polarized Indian politics as probably nothing else since independence. With no legal outlet for their opposition to the government, politically active Indians could turn increasingly to clandestine activities and violence.</p>
                        <p>33. The present repression could also eventually stimulate latent regional opposition to the center. While probably beyond the time frame of this paper, there is a potential for the growth of significant opposition, to the central government in the extreme south of India, in West Bengal, and in Kashmir. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s concentration of power in New Delhi has tended <pb n="16" xml:id="d229-16" facs="d229-16"/>to eliminate some of the strengths of the federal system so important for a country as ethnically and culturally diverse as India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Possible Course of Action</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>34. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> could defuse somewhat the threat of violence and dissident regionalism by moving to conciliate her enemies. The most obvious moves would be suspending the emergency, releasing political prisoners, and holding national elections.</p>
                        <p>35. With the continued absence of significant opposition, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> could well choose to lift the emergency — it could be reimposed at any time -and hold national elections. Elections would appear likely late this year or in the first half of 1977. Having little to fear in elections from the disparate opposition, we would expect her to release most, if not all, of the political leaders now in jail. Some might be released, however, only on condition they quit politics. Any election held, even if carried out with scrupulous honesty, would almost certainly lead to a very large Congress Party victory — giving <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>, once again, the majority in Parliament necessary to amend the constitution at will.</p>
                        <p>36. Some form of censorship, meanwhile, is likely to remain in force indefinitely. During her ten years in office, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has frequently demonstrated resentment at the press for its criticism of her and its support of her enemies. She probably had newspapers in mind when she warned shortly after the emergency was proclaimed that there could be no return to the “permissiveness of the past.” It is possible that censorship will continue to be loosened, as it has been slightly since the early days of the emergency, but not removed entirely. Editors and reporters can be expected to continue to test the barriers to determine how far they can safely go. Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has moved in another direction to assure friendly coverage in the large newspaper chains in India by exerting increasing influence over their publishers.</p>
                        <pb n="17" xml:id="d229-17" facs="d229-17"/>
                        <p>37. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s campaign against the restraints which the courts have sought to place on her can also be expected to continue. In April 1976, the Working Committee of the Congress Party proposed constitutional changes which would restrict the power of judicial review at both federal and state levels of legislation. Another proposal is to the effect that amendments to the constitution cannot be called into question “in any court on any ground.” If eventually passed by parliament, as seems inevitable, this latter change would surmount a major hurdle to government plans for basic changes in the constitution via the amendment process.</p>
                        <p>38. In short, now that <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has clearly established herself as the unchallenged leader of India, she may be willing to lift some repressive measures. It is unlikely, however, that she will retreat from a basically authoritarian approach to governing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">International Relations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>39. The prime minister and most of her countrymen harbor a deep-seated desire to make India strong enough to stand on its own, free from dependency on any other power. They also want to limit foreign involvement in bilateral disputes within South Asia. India's recent initiatives toward China and Pakistan, as well as the sending of an ambassador to Moscow after a year's hiatus, probably indicate a decision by New Delhi to play a more active role in international affairs. Recent years have seen India concentrate on internal problems while abdicating to more radical states a once leading position in the Third World. At the Non-Aligned Summit Conference, scheduled for Colombo in August 1976, India's apparent goal of reasserting a leading role in the movement may become clearer. Meanwhile, New Delhi can be expected to continue its active effort to restrict membership in the movement to those states not allied to either East or West. The primary object of this activity will be to keep the traditional enemy, Pakistan, out of the non-aligned group.</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="d229-18" facs="d229-18"/>
                        <p>40. The possibility exists of growing rivalry between India and Iran, the only other regional nation with major power ambitions. India's hopes for further Iranian economic assistance, concessional oil prices, and its desire to minimize Tehran's political and military support of Pakistan, should keep New Delhi from permitting a serious confrontation to develop. Tehran, likewise, is interested in reducing the likelihood of friction, and Iran has worked for better relations in recent years on a number of fronts.</p>
                        <p>41. India's vast size and relative power within South Asia will continue to worry smaller states in the region. New Delhi considers South Asia as an area of its primacy, if not hegemony, and will have little tolerance for opposition from its smaller neighbors. Bhutan, and to a lesser degree Nepal, will continue to be dominated by India. Relations with Sri Lanka are good and are likely to remain so for the period of this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>42. Relations with Bangladesh present the most likely source of trouble during the next three years. Political instability, compounded by almost insurmountable economic problems, will remain a feature of life in Dacca. While the present government is apparently acceptable to New Delhi, there is no assurance it will remain in power for even one, let alone three years. Any successor would probably be less acceptable to the Indians.</p>
                        <p>43. Violent political changes in Bangladesh could be accompanied by communal clashes and a large-scale movement of Hindu refugees into India. The communal disturbances could erupt as a result of long-standing Hindu-Muslim hatreds or, conceivably, could be stimulated by New Delhi as a pretext for eventual military intervention. The latter would increase in probability if there were a change of government in Dacca followed by a shift of foreign policy toward greatly improved relations with Islamabad and Peking. Regardless of the cause of the refugee flow, India could be expected to first threaten and then actually intervene militarily in Bangladesh.</p>
                        <pb n="19" xml:id="d229-19" facs="d229-19"/>
                        <p>44. The restoration of diplomatic relations with Pakistan, as agreed to in the May 1976 bilateral negotiations, will make communication between New Delhi and Islamabad easier, but the historic drive of India for regional leadership will continue to be rejected by Pakistan. At best, relations will probably be cool and correct, interspersed with periods of heightened tension. Basic differences, e.g., the status of Kashmir, will remain, although neither government will be likely to press any issue to open confrontation. Probably the most dangerous scenario for the next three years in South Asia would evolve if India were to move militarily into Bangladesh and the latter called for international assistance. In the case of Pakistan, we would expect Prime Minister Bhutto to try to calibrate his nation's response so as to avoid another war with a militarily superior India.</p>
                        <p>45. Despite the upcoming exchange of ambassadors, India's relations with China will probably improve only marginally because of the reservoir of mutual suspicion and a competitive interest in South Asia. While the present leadership in Peking presumably will continue its efforts to detach India from its close ties to Moscow, it is unlikely to be willing to jeopardize its own intimate relationship with Pakistan in the absence of firm indications from New Delhi that a major realignment of Indian foreign relations is likely. We do not expect India to make such a realignment.</p>
                        <p>46. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> has made it clear that a basic plank of her foreign policy is continued close relations with the Soviet Union. New Delhi's efforts, however, to diversify its sources of military equipment, combined with growing indigenous defense production, will make India less reliant on Moscow. In the political arena, the two nations' interests are likely to coincide more often than not. Even so, New Delhi will probably seek to improve relations to a limited degree with China and the United States in an effort to establish a more balanced relationship with the three great powers.</p>
                        <pb n="20" xml:id="d229-20" facs="d229-20"/>
                        <p>47. Relations with the United States can be expected to continue much as they have existed over the past three years with periods of strain alternating with moves toward accommodation. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> would like to see her regime gain more acceptance from other countries, especially the United States. While Indian leaders would like to retain an aid tie to Washington, especially for food aid, they remain suspicious of United States' aims and activities in South Asia and in the Indian Ocean. Any major commitment of US arms to Pakistan would strain US-Indian relations, at least temporarily. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> and many of her associates will continue to find the United States a convenient scapegoat whenever a diversion is needed from domestic problems.</p>
                        <p>48. India's drive for recognition as a major power in the world was given a substantial boost by the explosion of a nuclear device in May 1974. Indian leaders claimed then, and still do, that they are developing nuclear explosives solely for peaceful purposes. No second blast has occurred, but the Indians have repeatedly indicated that more nuclear tests will be conducted after the results of the first explosion have been thoroughly studied. In February 1976, the chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission stated that the analysis had already been completed. A major constraint on carrying out a second test was removed in May 1976 when the Canadian government announced that it would not resume assistance, suspended following the first test, for India's nuclear power program. As long as the negotiations for resumption of Canadian assistance were underway, India was unlikely to conduct another blast.</p>
                        <p>49. With the removal of this factor, the Indians may move ahead with plans to conduct a second test. Little information is available on the timing of the next test, however, and it is likely that the Indian leadership, itself, has not established a firm testing schedule. India will approach the decision to resume testing very pragmatically. Considerations which India will take into account include the present <pb n="21" xml:id="d229-21" facs="d229-21"/>delicate stage in the normalization of relations with Pakistan and China, the forthcoming Non-Aligned Summit Conference in August, and the license application for nuclear fuel shipments for the Tarapur reactors pending before the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. [text not declassified], it is likely that no such event will occur before this fall.</p>
                        <p>50. In any event, it is prudent to assume that over the next few years India will move to develop a modest stockpile of nuclear weapons, but there is as yet no firm evidence that this is so. A major constraint on the size and shape of any Indian nuclear weapons force would be delivery capability. The only bombers now in the Indian inventory are slow Canberras, which have a combat radius of only about 1,000 nm with a 5,000-lb payload. The Indians are looking at planes which are faster and more maneuverable than the Canberras, but which have a considerably shorter combat radius. In order to obtain a long-range nuclear delivery capability within the time frame of this memorandum, India would have to purchase suitable long-range bombers. Efforts to develop a suitable missile delivery capability have been in progress since the 1960s; however, it will be the mid-1980s before that capability is realized.</p>
                        <p>51. This memorandum up to this point has been based on an assumption that no totally unexpected events occur — such as the sudden disappearance of <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> from the scene. It is impossible to create with any degree of assurance a scenario of events that would be likely to follow her demise. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s sudden removal would undoubtedly heighten factionalism within the Congress Party and fuel opposition activity. This could create a temporary law and order problem.</p>
                        <p>52. With <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> gone, there might initially be a period of collegial rule. Fairly soon, however, there would be a move to select a single leader, probably a senior cabinet member. There <pb n="22" xml:id="d229-22" facs="d229-22"/>is no obvious choice,but either Minister of Agriculture Jagjivan Ram or Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYB1">Y. B. Chavan</persName> despite their advanced ages, would be possible choices. Alternatively, the Congress high command might settle on some lesser known figure acceptable to most, if not all, of the party.</p>
                        <p>53. Conceivably, SANJAY GANDHI would attempt to succeed his mother. A move by Sanjay to grab power for himself would fly in the face of recent Indian history and traditional Indian preference for older leaders. Perhaps more likely would be an effort by Sanjay to act as a power broker.</p>
                        <p>54. Direct involvement by the armed forces in any succession struggle would be likely only if the Congress Party failed to unite around a single candidate and if, in the confusion that followed, there were threats of disintegration of the nation's political structure. Even then, they would probably consult first with the president, to whom they are responsible according to the constitution. Any action taken by the armed forces would probably be accompanied by a commitment for early return of the nation to civilian government.</p>
                        <p>55. Assuming that the transition to another Congress government was orderly, we would expect no basic change in Indian foreign policy — at least in the near term. These policies have evolved over a period of nearly three decades. Probably the most significant immediate change to be noted by the outside world would be a lack of decisiveness at the top, possibly combined with renewed dissension within party ranks. There is some potential danger in such a scenario as the new leadership, uncertain of its support within India, might attempt to rally the nation by adopting a strongly nationalistic -even bellicose — attitude toward some of its neighbors.</p>

                            <item>FOREIGN POLICY: THE 1975 EMERGENCY WAS INITIATED FOR DOMESTIC REASONS, NOT FOREIGN. BUT ON BALANCE IT SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN INDIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE MORE FLEXIBLE FOREIGN POLICIES, TO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS, TO BALANCE ITS DIPLOMACY AMONG THE POWERS MORE EVENLY, AND TO CALIBRATE ITS CONTROL OF DOMESTIC OPINION ON FOREIGN ISSUES WITH GREATER SENSITIVITY.</item>

                            <item>GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THE PRESS AND A “DISCIPLINED” PARLIAMENT HAS INCREASINGLY FORCED THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE AND TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS STATEMENTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE BY THE PRIME MINISTER. THE ADVERSE REACTION IN MOST WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO THE EMERGENCY'S CONSTRAINTS ON DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND POLITICAL ARRESTS INTRODUCED NEW ELEMENTS OF FRICTION IN <pb n="2" xml:id="d230-02" facs="d230-02"/>INDIAN RELATIONS WITH THE UK, FRG, FRANCE, CANADA, AND SOME SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES THAT COULD AFFECT ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH INDIA TN THE FUTURE IF THE RESTRAINTS GROW HARSHER, AND ALREADY HAS HAD A DIRECT AFFECT ON INDO-CANADIAN NUCLEAR COOPERATION. THE HOSTILE PRESS AND PUBLIC REACTION TO THE EMERGENCY IN THE US AROUSED MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S IRE AND WAS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS LEADING TO HER HARSH CRITICISM OF THE US THE END OF 1975 WHICH IN TURN RESULTED IN POSTPONEMENT BY THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> FOR 1976.</item>

                            <item>THE REDUCED ROLE OF THE PRO-MOSCOW COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA AND THE CONGRESS “LEFT” THE ANTI-COMMUNIST VIEWS OF SANJAY GANDHI, GREATER INDIAN DOMESTIC ECONOMIC PRAGMATISM, AND INDIA'S DECISION TO SEND AN AMBASSADOR TO PEKING ARE ALL ELEMENTS CONTRIBUTING TO AN APPARENT COOLING IN INDO-SOVIET RELATIONS, DESPITE GANDHI'S PROJECTED JUNE 1976 VISIT TO MOSCOW. AS WITH THE US, THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'S CLOSE CONTROL OVER THE PRESS AND PARLIAMENT HAS ENABLED IT TO CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATE THE ATMOSPHERE FOR WORKING OUT RELATIONS WITH BANGLADESH (THE BIGGEST HEADACHE FOR INDIAN FOREIGN POLICY MAKERS), PAKISTAN, CHINA, AND NEPAL. FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS NOW TALK CONFIDENTLY OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S ABILITY IN THE PRESENT SITUATION TO BRING ABOUT PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF A SINO-INDIAN BORDER AGREEMENT BASED ON THE STATUS QUO AT AN APPROPRIATE STAGE IN SINO-INDIAN DISCUSSIONS. SEEN FROM HERE, THE CHINESE ASSESSMENT OF THE APPARENT COOLING IN INDO-SOVIET RELATIONS MAY ALSO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TOWARD CHINESE WILLINGNESS TO TEST THE WATERS WITH INDIA AGAIN.</item>

                            <item>INTERNAL POLITICAL TRENDS: MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> INTRODUCED THE “INTERNAL” EMERGENCY LAST YEAR ARGUING THAT ONLY EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES COULD REVERSE INDIA'S DESCENT INTO CHAOS, RESTORE POLITICAL STABILITY AND ENHANCE NATIONAL UNITY. IN REALITY, HER ESSENTIAL PURPOSE WAS TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND HER PERSONAL POSITION AT THE HELM OF INDIAN POLITICS WHICH SHE FELT WAS BEING THREATENED BY ORGANIZED POLITICAL OPPOSITION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF CONGRESS AND FROM THE JUDICIARY. OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS SHE HAS USED HER ENHANCED POWERS TO NULLIFY THESE THREATS; INSULATE HERSELF FROM FUTURE CHALLENGES; TIGHTEN HER AUTHORITY WITHIN GOVERNMENT PARTY, SECURITY, AND INTELLIGENCE HIERARCHIES; FORCE OUT OF OFFICE THE ONLY TWO MAJOR OPPOSITION CONTROLLED STATE GOVERNMENTS IN INDIA (TAMIL NADU AND GUJARAT); DISARM OR REMOVE POTENTIAL COMPETITORS IN CONGRESS; “TAME” THE JUDICIARY AND ASSIST SANJAY GANDHI'S LATERAL ENTRY INTO INDIAN POLITICS.</item>

                            <item>THE EMERGENCY HAS ENABLED THE PRIME MINISTER TO <pb n="3" xml:id="d230-03" facs="d230-03"/>COMPLETE A SIX—YEAR-OLD PROCESS OF “DE—ENERGIZING” OTHER INSTITUTIONALIZED CENTERS OF POWER (E.G. PRESS, PARLIAMENT, JUDICIARY) IN THE WESTMINSTER DEMOCRACY INTRODUCED IN INDIA DURING THE NEHRUVIAN ERA. THE FLYWHEELS OF THE OLD SYSTEM REMAIN IN PLACE, BUT INCREASINGLY IN FORM ONLY. MEASURED IN STRICT POLITICAL TERMS, THE PRIME MINISTER'S POWER TODAY HAS NEVER BEEN GREATER. BUT THE LEGITIMACY AND POPULAR CONSENSUS THE OLD SYSTEM PROVIDED IS ALSO LESS ASSURED AND COULD BECOME INCREASINGLY UNCERTAIN IN THE FUTURE.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>THE OLD INSTITUTIONS PROVIDED FORUMS THROUGH WHICH THE MANY AND DIVERSE REGIONAL, ECONOMIC, CASTE, AND LINGUISTIC PRESSURES IN INDIA COULD FIND EXPRESSION AND RESOLVE CONFLICTS THROUGH RECIPROCITY AND COMPROMISE. UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM, MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> HAS INHERITED WEAKNESSES COMMON TO OTHER AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES. THE OVER—CENTRALIZATION OF DECISION-MAKING IN HER OWN HANDS HAS ALREADY CREATED ARBITRARINESS, SYCOPHANCY AND EXCESSIVE ZEALOTRY ON THE PART OF SUBORDINATES EAGER TO PLEASE. PROBLEMS AT LOWER LEVELS MAY NEVER BE REPORTED TO THE TOP (PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE UNPLEASANT) UNTIL TOO LATE, AS THE RECENT RIOTS OVER FAMILY PLANNING ILLUSTRATED. HAVING CONSTRUCTED A DECIDEDLY AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, THE PRIME MINSTER STILL LACKS THE TYPE OF POLITICAL OR SECURITY APPARATUS THAT OTHER AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES RELY ON THE COMMUNICATE WITH THE CONTROL THEIR POPULATIONS. PERHAPS OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER PERSONAL POSITION, SHE IS RELUCTANT TO REBUILD THE CONGRESS PARTY. A DISTANT POSSIBILITY IS THAT SHE MAY GRADUALLY TURN TO THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'S STILL GROWING INTELLIGENCE AND PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATIONS AS RESPONSIVE AND POWERFUL INSTRUMENTS WITH WHICH THE CONGRESS PARTY AND BUREAUCRACY WOULD HAVE TROUBLE COMPETING.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>OPPOSITION TACTICAL AND LEADERSHIP ADJUSTMENTS IN REACTION TO THE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY BUT IN A STATE OF FLUX BORDERING ON CONFUSION. THERE IS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE OLDER OPPOSITION LEADERS SCHOOLED IN THE “FREEDOM STRUGGLE” APPROACH OF MOBILIZING PEACEFUL PROTEST MOVEMENTS WILL SUCCEED GIVEN THE RESTRICTIONS MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> IS APPLYING. OVER THE LONG—RUN, OPPOSITION WILL PROBABLY DRIFT INCREASINGLY INTO ILLEGAL AND MILITANT CHANNELS.</item>

                            <item>FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S POLITICAL AND SECURITY ASSETS COMPARED TO THE WEAKNESSES OF OUR DIVIDED OPPOSITION; THE APOLITICAL ORIENTATION OF THE INDIAN MILITARY; THE PASSIVITY OF THE INDIAN MASSES AND THE REGIONAL-LINGUISTIC “COMPARTMENTALIZATION” OF POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN INDIA AND HER OWN UNPARALLELED POLITICAL SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE IN INDIAN POLITICS ALMOST GUARANTEE MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S DOMINANCE OVER INDIAN POLITICS FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE WOULD NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR MORE CLANDESTINE OPPOSITION IN SOME AREAS OF INDIA, INCLUDING THE PERIPHERAL “PROBLEM” STATES OF TAMIL NADU, GUJARAT, WEST BENGAL, BIHAR OR POSSIBLY EVEN PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM KASHMIR. IF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION WORSENS, THE POSSIBILITIES FOR RESISTANCE COULD INCREASE AS ELITE DISSATISFACTION, FEAR OF ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT, AND URBAN/LABOR UNREST FOCUS ON MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> AND HER PERSONALIZED REGIME. AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, SUCH DEVELOPMENTS ARE IN THE REALM OF <pb n="5" xml:id="d230-05" facs="d230-05"/>SPECULATION. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SAY AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO, WE ANTICIPATE NO SUBSTANTIAL THREAT OTHER THAN PERSONAL VIOLENCE TO HER POSITION AT THE HELM OF INDIAN POLITICS.</item>

                            <item>SOCIO-ECONOMIC RESULTS OF THE EMERGENCY: NEARLY ALL ACHIEVEMENTS REGISTERED SINCE THE EMERGENCY HAVE OCCURRED IN AREAS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'S DIRECT APPLICATION OF EXECUTIVE POWER. THE SUPPRESSION OF STRIKES PRODUCED A DEGREE OF LABOR PEACE UNKNOWN SINCE INDEPENDENCE. THE CENTER'S ARM-TWISTING OF CONGRESS STATE GOVERNMENTS LED TO A NUMBER OF LONG-POSTPONED SOLUTIONS TO A NUMBER OF INTER-STATE RIVER DISPUTES. THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'S INCREASED EMPHASIS ON POPULATION CONTROL HAS BROUGHT POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO FAMILY PLANNING FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE LEGAL-POLICE OFFENSIVE AGAINST BLACK MONEY HAS HELPED LOWER PRICES AND INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF GOODS, AND HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE INCREASE IN INDIA'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES TN RECENT MONTHS. THERE HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE ACHIEVEMENTS IN SLUM CLEARANCE, URBAN CLEANLINESS EFFORTS AND THE LAW AND ORDER SITUATION COUNTRYWIDE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO ACCELERATED ITS THREE-YEAR-OLD ORIENTATION TOWARD “PRAGMATIC” ECONOMIC POLICIES AND EFFECTED LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME RURAL REFORMS.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>THESE POSITIVE RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANT; BUT THEY ARE NO SUBSTITUTES FOR THE CHANGES IN BASIC POLICIES, PERSONNEL, AND ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO AMELIORATE THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, DEMOGRAPHIC AND MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS WHICH ARE THE ULTIMATE SOURCES OF INDIAN BACKWARDNESS AND LACK OF DYNAMISM. OVER THE PAST YEAR, MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S GOVERNMENT HAS NOT MADE ANY MARKED PROGRESS TOWARD INITIATING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN APPROACH TO THESE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE LONG HINDERED INDIA'S DEVELOPMENT.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>PERHAPS SIGNIFICANT STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION IN ONE YEAR WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO EXPECT TN VIEW OF THE NATURE AND ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE PROBLEMS THEMSELVES. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE PRIME MINISTER'S PERSONAL LEADERSHIP STYLE AND WEAK MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES, PARTICULARLY A RIGID UNWILLINGNESS TO DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITY (EXCEPT TO HER SON), ARE ALSO TO BLAME. HER APPROACH TO GOVERNING THIS NATION OF 600 MILLION IS ESSENTIALLY AD HOC AND SHORT-TERM. HER OWN GRASP OF ECONOMICS REMAINS WEAK; SHE IS SUSPICIOUS OF THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF MAJOR ECONOMIC DECISIONS AND CONTINUES TO ENTRUST THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES TO A GROUP OF LOYALIST TECHNOCRATS WITH LITTLE POLITICAL BASE <pb n="6" xml:id="d230-06" facs="d230-06"/>OF THEIR OWN. THEY DO THE BEST THEY CAN BUT SUFFER FROM LACK OF ANY REAL DIRECTION OR COURAGE AND ABILITY TO EFFECT CHANGE.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S GOVERNMENT IS YET TO TAKE MUCH NEEDED STEPS TO REFORM INDIA'S CIVIL BUREAUCRACY WHOSE STYLE AND ORGANIZATION HAS NOT ESSENTIALLY CHANGED SINCE INDEPENDENCE. ALTHOUGH GIVEN GOOD MARKS IN COMPARISON WITH CIVIL SERVICES IN OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IT REMAINS AN INADEQUATE CATALYTIC AGENT IN IMPLEMENTING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES. IT IS COMPETENT BUT THIN AT SENIOR LEVELS, AND WOEFULLY UNDERSTAFFED AT LOCAL, IMPLEMENTATION LEVELS WHERE DISTRICT COLLECTORS IN THEIR 30's ARE OFTEN CHARGED WITH ADMINISTRATING THREE TO TEN MILLION PEOPLE WITH A STAFF OF LESS THAN A DOZEN RESPONSIBLE SUBORDINATES. LOCAL CORRUPTION IS WIDESPREAD AND CONTINUES, WE BELIEVE, TO ADVERSELY AFFECT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS EVEN IF IT MAY HAVE BEEN CURBED SOMEWHAT SINCE THE EMERGENCY. HIGH LEVEL CORRUPTION AND EXTORTION FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IS UNCHANGED AND CLEARLY SANCTIONED FROM THE VERY TOP OF THE SYSTEM.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>THE EMERGENCY HAS ENABLED THE GOVERNMENT TO DO SOME NEEDED PATCHING AND REPAIR WORK ON THE ECONOMY. GIVEN FAVORABLE RAINS, CONTINUATION OF OUTPUT—ORIENTED ECONOMIC POLICIES, FULFILLMENT OF EXPECTATIONS FOR MAJOR INCREASES IN OIL PRODUCTION, AND A FAVORABLE OUTLOOK FOR THE EXTERNAL ECONOMIC SECTOR, THE MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE UPWARD BUT AT A SLOW PACE. LACK OF SPEEDY PROGRESS IS AS MUCH A PRODUCT OF THE PAST LOPSIDED EMPHASIS ON HEAVY INDUSTRIALIZATION [garbled text in original] LABOR TRANQUILITY PRODUCED BY THE EMERGENCY WILL FACILITATE INCREASED PRODUCTION. THE RECENT INDICATION OF INTENSIFIED GOI CONCERN ABOUT INDIA'S DEMOGRAPHIC NIGHTMARE IS ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNALS THAT THE FULL RESOURCES OF THE STATE MAY BE PUT BEHIND AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN THIS VITAL AREA. IF SO, IT MAY ONLY BE POSSIBLE IF THE EMERGENCY CONTINUES AND ADEQUATE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY CAN BE DEVELOPED IN A SHORT TIME; EVEN THEN THE PROGRAMS COULD ULTIMATELY AROUSE DEEP AND STRIDENT OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT IF PERSUASION WERE TO BECOME COERCION ON A LARGE SCALE.</item>
                            <label>14.</label>
                            <item>BUT SHORT OF MORE SUCH FAR REACHING CHANGES IN PERSONNEL AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES AND SOME DEGREE OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORM, MANY OF THE ROADBLOCKS TO PROGRESS <pb n="7" xml:id="d230-07" facs="d230-07"/>WILL CONTINUE IN PLACE AND YIELD ONLY BY INCHES. GAINS WILL BE SUBJECT TO SETBACKS DEPENDING ON THE VAGARIES OF THE MONSOONS; PROSPECTS FOR SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGHS IN SOLVING INDIA'S UNDERLYING FOOD, ADMINISTRATIVE AND SOCIETAL PROBLEMS WILL REMAIN POOR.</item>

                            <item>THE QUESTION OF THE SUCCESSION: THIS ANALYSIS IS PREDICATED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S POSITION AS INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER IS SECURE FOR THE SHORT-RUN AT LEAST. INDEED, SO FAR AS WE KNOW, SHE IS IN GOOD HEALTH AT AGE 58 AND COULD GO ON FOR ANOTHER GENERATION. AS HER SON SANJAY MATURES, SHE MAY FEEL HE IS READY TO MOVE INTO HER POSITION TEN YEARS (HE WILL BE 40) OR MORE HENCE, AND MAY CONSIDER “WITHDRAWING” IN HIS FAVOR. BUT THE SUCCESSION COULD FOLLOW A DIFFERENT PATTERN SHOULD SHE DIE SOONER—-AND SUDDENLY. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THE PRESENT SANJAY-LED “INNER CIRCLE” AROUND THE PRIME MINSTER IS ALREADY WORKING TO POSITION ITSELF TO CAPTURE THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP IN THE EVENT OF MRS. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName>'S SUDDEN DEATH. BUT WE DO NOT WRITE OFF THE POSSIBILITY THAT IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CURRENTLY MORIBUND POLITICIANS WILL REVIVE THEMSELVES AND ATTEMPT TO OUTMANEUVER THE “INNER CIRCLE” AND SECURE THE SELECTION OF AN ALTERNATIVE CANDIDATE. THE RESULTING POLITICAL FRAY COULD CONCEIVABLY LEAD TO SPLITS IN THE CONGRESS OF NOT TO ITS OUTRIGHT DISINTEGRATION AND TO VIOLENCE. TENSIONS AND PRESSURES FROM REGIONAL POLITICIANS COULD ADD TO A GENERAL UNCERTAINTY; THE “INNER CIRCLE” COULD ATTEMPT TO USE THEIR SYMPATHIZERS IN THE INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY SERVICES AND THE DELHI ADMINISTRATION TO ESTABLISH THEIR CLAIM, AND IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY COULD BE CRUCIAL. IF THE “INNER CIRCLE” SHOULD SUCCEED IN CAPTURING THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP, THE LIKELIHOOD OF SHARPLY ENHANCED AUTHORITARIANISM IN INDIA WOULD INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY.</item>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What is the problem?</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We have to do what we can to try to head off this project. There are three areas in which we are proposing to work. We have our own diplomatic resources and leverage. We have the leverage of others and in particular the Canadians. And finally, we want to find some face-saver for <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>. In this regard we might work with the germ of an idea the SHAH expressed to Helms regarding holding out a multinational alternative at some time in the future.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: As I have said before I am becoming disillusioned with this multinational idea. I am coming to the view that binational arrangements might be better. Win told me he was going to have a memorandum for me on this. Where is it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. LORD</hi>: It should be in your office, Sir.</p>

                            </hi>: Under some circumstances, multinational projects could simply end up spreading the problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS1">Vest</persName>
                            </hi>: Binational and multinational are not exclusive concepts. We consider the binational concept simply to be the very minimum type of this sort of arrangement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: When all is said and done what matters is the penalty for kicking out the non-national element or the penalty for getting rid of the supplier. I don't see why it is any better for Pakistan and Iran to have a joint facility. It doesn't add any restraint on either of them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. LORD</hi>: No. In fact it would be worse. It would give the technology to both parties. Our idea is not to encourage a joint Pakistan-Iran facility, but to permit the SHAH to hold out the prospect of an eventual multinational project which would give <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> a way to save face and would buy time for us in the region.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I have just told the Germans that we oppose such an arrangement. I must say that now that I have had a chance to take a closer look at the FRG-Iran agreement it is not such an irresponsible commitment. If I had known the details earlier I might not have raised objections.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. LORD</hi>: The Iran-Pakistan arrangement would only involve an agreement in principle.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Look. A reprocessing plant in Japan in which Korea would participate is a way to hold down Korea, not Japan. It actually adds to Japan's capability. All they have to do is kick out the Koreans. The desire of Iran and Pakistan for this capability is about equal and a binational facility would give them equal access to plutonium.</p>

                            </hi>: The proposal might actually accelerate the introduction of reprocessing technology into the area.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: We are not thinking about an absolute commitment, just an agreement in principle which would give Bhutto some logical explanation for giving up his present project.</p>

                            </hi>: What kind of plant is this?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS1">Vest</persName>
                            </hi>: It is a very large pilot plant, in fact four times that the French proposed to sell to Korea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I must say I have some sympathy for <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in this. We are doing nothing to help him on conventional arms, we are going ahead and selling nuclear fuel to India even after they exploded a bomb and then for this little project we are coming down on him like a ton of bricks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Kratzer</hi>: The difference between the Indian and Pakistani cases is that Bhutto came in second.</p>

                            </hi>: We don't like what the Indians are doing either.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: But we are not doing anything about it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. LORD</hi>: Mr. Secretary, you should know of intelligence reports which indicate that the Pakistanis already have a laboratory-scale facility.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC1">Ikle</persName>
                            </hi>: There is an important difference between the Pakistani and the Indian cases. The Pakistani reprocessing project doesn't fit into a power program while the Indians at least have an extensive power program which could conceivably utilize this sort of technology.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName>
                            </hi>: Does Pakistan have a heavy water facility?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Kratzer</hi>: No.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC1">Ikle</persName>
                            </hi>: Pakistan's only present reactor is a heavy water facility which does not use enriched fuel and therefore cannot utilize the plutonium which might be recovered from a reprocessing facility.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Is Pakistan buying a power reactor too?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Kratzer</hi>: They are shopping for a light water reactor and have approached us in this regard.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: You mean they are starting with a reprocessing plant?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: What are they going to reprocess?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Kratzer</hi>: The small Canadian reactor provides spent fuel which can be reprocessed but the recovered plutonium can't be used to refuel that Canadian reactor because it doesn't require enriched fuel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName>
                            </hi>: That is just what the Indians did.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Why would it not be better to wait on all this until I go to Iran?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS1">Vest</persName>
                            </hi>: There would be one problem and that relates to the Canadians. The Canadian cabinet is meeting July 22 to make a decision on the course of their own negotiations with Pakistan. They deserve to know what we intend to do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. SONNENFELDT</hi>: We could probably get them to delay that decision.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I am seeing MacEachen on the 30th and could talk with him at that time. It is not going to be hard to get the Canadians not to sell a reactor.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC1">Ikle</persName>
                            </hi>: If the Canadians sold a reactor the Pakistanis would have to agree to tight controls over reprocessing of the spent fuels.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Kratzer</hi>: The issue for the Canadians is not the sale of an additional reactor. Canada is trying to renegotiate their present agreements with Pakistan to provide for assurances and better controls in return for which they would continue to help the Pakistanis operate the reactor they already have.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VGS1">Vest</persName>
                            </hi>: Whatever we do we owe it to them to let them know what our intentions are.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IFC1">Ikle</persName>
                            </hi>: Would there be any value in getting into technical discussions with the Pakistanis on the whole issue of the technical end of reprocessing and the economics of this technology?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> knows the technological details and he knows what he wants.</p>

                            </hi>: That's right. And what he wants is to build a bomb.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: If you were in his place you would do the same thing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. LORD</hi>: The first decision we must make is whether we want to lean on <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> more, to apply some leverage. Secondly, we need to decide how to convince him that there is a better way to achieve his objectives and that is where the concept of a multinational alternative comes in.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has already agreed to that.</p>

                            </hi>: But what he has agreed to is a facility with Iran located in Pakistan, and that gives us serious problems.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: We can't tell him both that he must have a multinational facility and that it must be located outside his own country. Suppose <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> says, “All right, as soon as you get a reprocessing plant established in Iran I will be happy to give up my project.”?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: I see nothing to gain from a multinational plant. We can't tell <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> that he must have a multinational plant but that it can't be located in Pakistan because then you would have us going to the SHAH and telling him he also can't build it in Iran.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. SONNENFELDT</hi>: If we did not object, the Germans would have a right to complain about why we objected to their agreement.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Knowing what all I know now, I would not complain to the Germans about their agreement. It is not an irresponsible agreement. It is indistinguishable with what we have agreed to with Iran. Perhaps it is even somewhat better because the Germans have established that it is ten years down the road. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName>: Have we exhausted all our diplomatic avenues with the French?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Kratzer</hi>: One thing in regard to the French that we should keep in mind is that they are probably not prepared to stand aside like they did in the Korean case. We might, however, consider trying to channel the Pakistani interest into a French-built light water reactor.</p>

Gentlemen, there are few countries in the world which by necessity or choice are still allies of ours. There is something indecent about our always proving that we are strong by kicking our allies in the teeth. We told the Pakistanis one year ago that we would provide military equipment. We also told the Chinese. This is against my instructions that we are not moving forward. When did I see the Pakistan Ambassador? He is a very intelligent man and he believes we have been holding back.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: The question here is does the Bureau have the right to refuse my direct orders. We went through this in 1971 with <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>.</p>

                            </hi>: Mr. Secretary, this is a different Bureau now and we are not disobeying your orders. You should decide if we want to go ahead and eliminate this as a part of our strategy.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Let's get this straight. You are holding up everything except the TOWs.</p>

                            </hi>: No. The TOWs is just the most important case which we have sent forward. I'll check with Defense and get the details for a report to you. The Pakistanis have had trouble making up their own minds on a number of these cases.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Our Embassy in Islamabad just completed a study of our experience. Since the embargo was lifted a year ago, the Pakistanis have asked for 43 cases. Of these, 21 LOAs have already been signed. Most of the others have been held up because the Pakistanis have either not accepted the cases, have asked for revisions, or have changed their minds. There were only seven cases of unusual delay and four of these are naval items which require special Congressional action.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Twenty-one of 43 is less than half. Less than half in over one year does not indicate a spectacular effort on our part.</p>

                            </hi>: Do you want to use military supply as leverage? If we don't apply some leverage, then <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> will interpret it to be a free ride.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: This would be the first country in which we were applying this sort of leverage.</p>

                            </hi>: I see no problem in putting these other cases forward while holding back on the A-7's if that is what you want to do.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: That is absolutely right. We started this military supply relationship with the Pakistanis with great fanfare and have delivered nothing. There is no leverage in interrupting something that we are not giving anyway.</p>

                            </hi>: Is it possible to put together a package of attractive inducements such. as we had for Korea?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. Kratzer</hi>: Those inducements in the Korean case were largely window dressing.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: Is it a plausible policy for us to make our ally Pakistan totally dependent on Indian good will? The Pakistanis don't even have the appearance of a credible defense. What they have asked for from us is piddling compared to what the Indians have. I don't think it adds to the stature of the United States to force an ally to be defenseless. Now, if we were giving him something important we might have some leverage but this stuff is just junk. FMS credits would give us some leverage. Letting this stuff go forward does not preclude using arms as leverage at a later date. What is it that you have been holding up?</p>

                            </hi>: The things which we could put forward now are torpedoes, artillery, Sidewinder missiles, an Air Force study of Pakistan's air defense system, minesweepers and APC's.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Secretary</hi>: This is what I want to do. First, the only way we are going to get him off this reprocessing plant is to give him a reactor and accept the same terms as the FRG-Iran agreement. Secondly, we should tell him that we will take steps to enhance his conventional defense. We can't tell <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> that he can't have either a conventional or a nuclear defense.</p>

This proposal would cause problems for the French because the French company selling the reprocessing is different from the company which would sell the reactor, though in total it would be a better deal for French exports.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As you know, options were prepared by State for HAK on what we might do next, now that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> has rejected the President's request that Pakistan forgo acquisition of the French nuclear reprocessing plant.</p>
                        <p>The recommended option was that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> be told that no military aid (particularly A-7s) would be considered until Pakistan cancelled the reprocessing plant contract. Further, (with the exception of P/M) it was recommended that the SHAH's help be enlisted to offer Pakistan a part in Iran's future multinational reprocessing plant as a substitute for a Pakistan national plant. The purpose of this was to give the SHAH something he could offer <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in order to mitigate the impact of Iranian pressure on Pakistan not to acquire a national facility.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary had a high level meeting in State on Friday (which we could have usefully attended if invited), and made a number of interim decisions on this issue. In summary, he said:
<list>
                                <item>— He is displeased that conventional arms deliveries to Pakistan are being held up rather than expedited and ordered Atherton to get them moving as rapidly as possible. The only item on which the Secretary wishes to place political hold is the A-7. [Comment: No major items are being held up except for the bill to Congress on the Gearing Class DDs; a few minor items are delayed owing to administrative rather than political reasons.]</item>
                                <item>— He does not want to sponsor an Iran multinational plant as a quid pro quo for Pakistan cancellation of its planned plant. This, inter alia, would be inconsistent with his recent demarche to the FRG objecting to their possible provision of a reprocessing plant to Iran in the near term. Furthermore, the U.S. does not have a really legitimate basis on which to object to <pb n="2" xml:id="d232-02" facs="d232-02"/>Pakistan wanting to reprocess its fuel in its own country. The multinational reprocessing concept is proving much less attractive than he earlier believed. [Comment: This is the second time in recent weeks that HAK has made this last statement. He indicated in an earlier meeting that the concept is a “fraud” since there are virtually no locations where either we or the host are really prepared to approve. There is obviously some misunderstanding of the concept on his part, since the FRG/Iran approach which he tends to support — see below — is in fact one version of multinationality which we had proposed from the outset.]</item>
                                <item>— Upon closer examination, the FRG/IRAN agreement is not objectionable since it explicitly delays acquisition of reprocessing in Iran until a number of reactors are operating (the 1990 era) and until reprocessing is economically justified. And any eventual plant will involve German joint ownership and operation (the minimum but acceptable multinational involvement). [Comment: We agree with HAK's view. The main State rationale for telling Von Staden that the U.S. objects to the reprocessing aspects of the FRG/Iran agreement was an effort by P/M and <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> to guard the Administration's record position against a possible media and Congressional convulsion of criticism over the deal — which has failed to materialize, at least thus far.]</item>
                                <item>— We should look at the possibility of encouraging a France/Pakistan nuclear arrangement along the lines of the FRG/Iran deal. Namely, France would sell reactors to Pakistan now and postpone a reprocessing plant for 15-25 years, and then require its co-ownership. We should help this proposition by offering some U.S. components for the French reactors and favorable Ex-Im financing. It would be hoped that this would “buy off” the French, since they won't lose any business now. (In fact, since reactors cost much more, France — though not the reprocessing company per se — could make more money.) [Comment: This proposal is very interesting and would essentially meet our non-proliferation objectives. Since, however, France is already perfectly free to sell reactors to Pakistan, neither France nor Pakistan may perceive this as a new element. But it is certainly worth pursuing.]</item>
                                <item>— To sweeten this deal for Pakistan, HAK would offer A-7s in exchange for agreeing to this new approach. [Comment: Presumably he means that the Administration would make a maximum effort to obtain favorable Congressional action.]</item>
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d232-03" facs="d232-03"/>
                                <item>— He will pursue these questions with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> when visiting Islamabad in August.</item>
                                <item>— We will also consult the Canadians to inform them of where things stand, tell them we wish to work in concert on the Pakistani nuclear problem, and promise to be back in touch when HAK returns from his trip.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Summary Comment</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not clear that this new approach will offer the French and the Paks enough of a carrot (i.e., <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> agreement to facilitate early reactor sales, withdraw our objection to eventual reprocessing along the lines of the FRG/Iran agreement, and A-7s) or a stick (i.e., withhold approval for the A-7, though continuing with other military equipment) to modify their present agreement on an early reprocessing facility. Pakistan clearly wants to have, in the near term, a nuclear capability comparable to that of India, including the possibility of making a nuclear explosive device. It is a proposal worth putting to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, particularly with the Secretary's persuasive personal touch. But if it does not sell, the French deal will be very far down the road and even more difficult to block.</p>
                        <p>The Germans have very informally suggested that a quadripartite reprocessing plant might be constructed in Iran, involving the U.S., FRG, France, and Iran. State has not pursued this because we might stimulate a plant in Iran earlier than otherwise. If HAK's above proposals are not effective, however, because Pakistan claims to need reprocessing and will not accept a long delay in acquiring that capability, we might reconsider the quadripartite approach as offering the Paks a nearby plant where they can receive reprocessing services or even become a partner.</p>

India has had good leadership but India has not been run by saints. I remember in 1961, when I was advising President <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> on Berlin, they kept saying we must get India's support. I said, if Nehru gave us support, he would be the bloodiest fool. Why should India antagonize the Soviets? At that time the disappointments were a subterranean phenomenon.

                            <item>DURING THE COURSE OF CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 1, BETWEEN THE FOREIGN SECRETARY AND SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS STAFFDEL MANTEL IN THE AFTERNOON AND BETWEEN THE DCM AND TEJA, SEPTEMBER 2, SEVERAL REFERENCES WERE MADE TO US-INDIA RELATIONS AND MILITARY SALES TO PAKISTAN. THESE MILITARY SALES WERE NOTEWORTHY FOR THEIR RESTRAINT ALTHOUGH A CLEAR MESSAGE CAME THROUGH THAT US MILITARY SALES BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON US-INDIA RELATIONS, A THEME WHICH WAS PARALLELED BOTH IN RESTRAINT AND IN THE CAUTION FOR THE FUTURE IN ALMOST STAFFDEL MANTEL'S CONVERSATIONS IN DELHI.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>MEHTA'S CONVERSATION WITH THE DCM PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE COLOMBO CONFERENCE. HE DIGRESSED REGARDING INDIA'S PROBLEMS WITH BANGLADESH AND PAKISTAN IN WAYS WHICH, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF SUCCEEDING CONVERSATIONS, BECAME RELEVANT TO US-INDIA RELATIONS. AFTER DESCRIBING THE STATUS OF INDIA'S PROBLEMS WITH BANGLADESH, WHILE HE DID NOT WISH TO SPEAK OFFICIALLY, HE VERY MUCH HOPED THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE DONE TO <pb n="2" xml:id="d234-02" facs="d234-02"/>DEMONSTRATE THAT THE US DOES NOT REJOICE IN THE DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN BANGLADESH AND INDIA. THE DCM REPLIED, OF COURSE, THAT EXCEPT FOR ECONOMIC MATTERS THE US HAD REFRAINED FROM US INVOLVEMENT IN BANGLADESH'S AFFAIRS. WE REPORT THIS TO INDICATE IN BANGLADESH'S AFFAIRS. WE REPORT THIS TO INDICATE THAT MEHTA, WHOM WE BELIEVE IS SEEKING TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE US, STILL BELIEVES HE NEEDS HELP IN DEMONSTRATING US BONA FIDES IN BANGLADESH.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>SHIFTING TO PAKISTAN, MEHTA SPECULATED ABOUT PAKISTAN'S MOTIVES IN REGARD TO RECENT STATEMENTS CONCERNING KASHMIR. HE WONDERED IF THEY WERE MADE FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION OR IF THEY REPRESENTED SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS. IN ANY EVENT, HE SAID, ALTHOUGH INDIA HAS SO FAR REFRAINED FROM ANY COMMENT, IT CANNOT DO SO INDEFINITELY. (DELHI IS A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT ITS SOMEWHAT SHAKY POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH SHEIKH <persName corresp="p_ASW1">ABDULLAH</persName> AT PRESENT AND MAY BE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO BHUTTO'S COMMENTS ABOUT KASHMIR IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.) THEN MEHTA ASKED RHETORICALLY IF SOME METHOD MIGHT NOT BE FOUND BY WHICH THE ANXIETIES OF THE SUBCONTINENT COULD BE ASSUAGED.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>MEHTA TOOK HIS ANALYSIS OF THE PAKISTAN PROBLEM SOMEWHAT FARTHER WHEN SPEAKING TO MANTEL. HE DESCRIBED THE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE RECENT AGREEMENT WITH PAKISTAN AND ITS RAPID IMPLEMENTATION BUT AGAIN DESCRIBED RECENT STATEMENTS IN PAKISTAN ABOUT KASHMIR WHICH HE SAID RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT PROSPECTS OF THE FUTURE. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT HE MADE HIS ONLY COMMENT ON US MILITARY SALES TO PAKISTAN. HE SAID THAT THE SALE OF SOME OFFENSIVE WEAPON SUCH AS THE A-7 COULD START THE CYCLE OF INDIA-PAKISTAN ACTIONS AND REACTIONS GOING AGAIN, AND WOULD HAVE “POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE.” BY THE LATTER, HE MEANT IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE PAKISTANIS (AS ALSO THE INDIANS) AS INDICATING THEY HAD THE POLITICAL SUPPORT OF THE US. IT WOULD, MEHTA SAID, DAMAGE BOTH INDIA-PAKISTANI RELATIONS AND INDIA-US RELATIONS. IT SEEMS TO US SIGNIFICANT THAT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANTEL STARTED THE CONVERSATION BY DESCRIBING HIS SPECIFIC INTEREST IN THE MILITARY SALES PROGRAM, MEHTA OFFERED ONLY THIS SINGLE COMMENT ON US SALES.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>THE NEXT DAY TEJA WAS SOMEWHAT MORE SPECIFIC REGARDING US MILITARY SALES BUT STILL RESTRAINED. IF US ARMS SUPPLY TO PAKISTAN IS OF SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO HAVE “POLITICAL IMPACT”, HE SAID, IT <pb n="3" xml:id="d234-03" facs="d234-03"/>WILL CAUSE CONCERNS IN INDIA. HE MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY A-7S OR TANKS. HE RECOGNIZED, HOWEVER, THAT THE US HAD GONE SLOW IN SALES IN RECENT YEARS; HE ALSO NOTED THAT SO FAR THE US WAS OFFERING ARMS ONLY FOR CASH SALE. TEJA ALSO MENTIONED THE RE-EMERGENCE OF KASHMIR ISSUE IN PAKISTAN, MAKING CLEAR THAT HIS CONCERN ABOUT THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF US ARMS SALES RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS PAKISTAN'S ATTITUDE TOWARD NEGOTIATIONS WITH INDIA. THE EXPLAINED THAT US SALES HAD INDEED BEEN MODEST AND SAID THAT MANY PEOPLE QUESTIONED WHY INDIA WAS CONCERNED ABOUT US SALES WHEN IT HAD SUCH EXTENSIVE FOREIGN SOURCES ITSELF AND WAS CLEARLY MILITARILY SUPERIOR. TEJA DID NOT PRESS THE ISSUE PERHAPS BECAUSE, AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD MANTEL, THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> DID NOT WISH TO MAKE US-PAKISTAN RELATIONS THE PRINCIPAL DETERMINANT OF US-INDIA RELATIONS.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>THESE DISCUSSIONS LEAD US TO SEVERAL TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS. FIRST, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE ARE THOSE HIGH IN THE GOI WHO CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE US IS OPERATING AGAINST INDIA'S INTEREST IN BOTH BANGLADESH AND PAKISTAN; AND THERE ARE THOSE, SUCH AS THE FOREIGN SECRETARY, WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THEM WRONG. SECOND, IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT TACTICALLY AT LEAST, THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS BEEN HANDLING THE ARMS ISSUE QUITE DIFFERENTLY FROM IN THE PAST. IT HAS NOT COMPLAINED ABOUT MODEST SALES AND, INDEED, HAS NOT YET MADE AN ISSUE WITH US IN DELHI OF THOSE SALES WHICH ARE NOW BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE. THIRD, IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> SEES A LIMIT TO ITS RESTRAINT AND THE A-7 EXCEEDS THAT LIMIT. MANTEL WAS TOLD BY THE MEA PLANNING JOINT SECRETARY (DAMODARAN) THAT INDIA DID NOT SEE AN A-7 TRADE OFF FOR REPROCESSING FACILITIES AS ACCEPTABLE IN ANY WAY. THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE A MUCH MORE VAGUELY DEFINED LIMIT WHICH IS THAT QUANTITY OF ARMS SALES WHICH THE INDIANS SEE AS AFFECTING PAKISTAN'S STANCE REGARDING INDIA. IN THIS REGARD INDIAN OFFICIALS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR: THAT OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS TIMING AND THE STATE OF US-INDIA RELATIONS WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEIR REACTION TO US ARMS SALES. IF US-INDIA RELATIONS WERE WARM AND A US ARMS SALE TO PAKISTAN WAS NOT MADE AT A TIME OF INDIA-PAKISTAN DIFFICULTY, INDIA MIGHT NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT.</item>

                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>WE DON'T WANT TO EXAGGERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DIALOGUE WHICH IN SOME REGARD RESEMBLES THAT WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE YEARS AND WHICH WE OFTEN WOULD PREFER TO FORGET. WE DID NOTE, HOWEVER, A TOUCH OF RESTRAINT AND A SUSPICION OF A SLIGHTLY MORE TOLERANT ATTITUDE THROUGHOUT MANTEL'S NUMEROUS MEETINGS IN DELHI. THIS MAY REPRESENT CHANGE, OR BETTER TACTICS, OR SIMPLY THE VIEWS OF INTELLIGENT INDIANS DURING RATIONAL MOMENTS.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>WE WERE PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY THE RELAXED INDIAN ATTITUDE TOWARD US ARMS SALES TO IRAN. SEVERAL SENIOR MEA OFFICIALS (THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING, SOVIET AFFAIRS, AND EVEN PAKISTAN) AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR DEF STUDIES AND ANALYSIS TOLD MANTEL THAT WHILE THEY DID NOT NECESSARILY AGREE WITH ITS ARMS PURCHASES, NEITHER WERE THEY CONCERNED AS A POTENTIAL ARMS SUPPLIER TO PAKISTAN. THE MEA JOINT SECRETARY FOR SOVIET AFFAIRS REMARKED THAT THE RUSSIANS HAD REPEATEDLY URGED THE DANGER OF THE ARMS BUILDUP IN IRAN TO INDIA IN CONVERSATIONS WITH GOI OFFICIALS AND HAD BEEN POLITELY TOLD THAT THE INDIANS WERE NOT CONCERNED SINCE THEIR RELATIONS WITH IRAN WERE NOW EXCELLENT. EVEN ASSUMING AN ELEMENT OF DISINGENUOUSNESS WITH THIS ARGUMENT, <pb n="5" xml:id="d234-05" facs="d234-05"/>IT IS AT LEAST EVIDENT THAT INDIA IS NOT PREPARED TO EXPRESS ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT IRANIAN PURCHASES TO THE US OR IRAN ITSELF. SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA, ON THE OTHER HAND, WERE POTENTIALLY RISKIER FOR INDIA—OFFICIALS TOLD MANTEL—SINCE THE SAUDIS MIGHT WELL RASHLY COMMIT THEIR RESOURCES TO PAKISTANI ASSISTANCE.</item>

                        <p>What I wanted to tell you this afternoon is the same thing that I've told Giscard and your Prime Minister. The nuclear reprocessing issue has become a domestic issue. Each of us is in exactly the same boat.</p>

                            </hi>: Yes. Giscard is sensitive, as is your Prime Minister. Frankly, there are two interpretations of what your Prime Minister told me in Lahore. First is that you have decided to go ahead and have simply taken an elegant way of saying that neither of you can take the initiative cancelling it. Or, both of you are now on the horns of a dilemma with, ramifications neither could foresee. You know what the American domestic situation is. You know that if the Democrats win, they would like nothing better than to make a horrible example of somebody. They would love to take on the French, but they can't. They cannot be accused of being anti—European integration and anti-NATO, let alone anti-Atlantic. If the Democrats win, you will face an assault and they will attack you. Credit and arms sales will be much more difficult, even impossible. You know that the last thing I want to do is to be responsible for this. Frankly, what I would like at this point is some sense of what you would like to do.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">YAQUB</hi>: I appreciate that. If I may speak frankly in reply to your question, your objections came after we signed an agreement with France. It is quite possible that we might be able to explain that away. But the Prime Minister reasoned that despite IAEA and other safeguards, there is still a chance that the 7% of unsafeguarded plutonium can be diverted. The Prime Minister suggests that without prejudice to our agreement with France, we look at what we might do with the seven percent.</p>

                            </hi>: You know, of course, this “newspaper crisis” (referring to the controversy over the Symington Amendment) was manufactured. I had never read the Symington Amendment and then everyone said: “But what will you do?” I said it may apply. They then wrote: “<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry A. Kissinger</persName> threatens Pakistan!”</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: Multinational control simply complicates problems. How could you possible handle it if the Saudi, Iranians and Iraqis were involved? It would be infinitely more complicated. There is no regional arrangement that could possibly be worked out that would work. But if we can somehow show something positive on reprocessing, then we may be able to do something on conventional arms.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">YAQUB</hi>: If we can remove the impression of a threat, perhaps we may be able to do something. If the A-7 could be agreed to “en principe”, then perhaps we can see if we can do something about safeguarding the seven percent.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">YAQUB</hi>: The Prime Minister's view is that the commitment would be a fundamental one.

You are or are not saying that one side has said he couldn't cave because the other side has said it wouldn't cave? The French President said they'd cave but Bhutto won't. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> told me that he'd cave, but the French won't. I mean, I want to be sure that I understand this absolutely clearly. The French have not said that they would not go through with it. They said they would and I didn't pressure them, but I got the idea that if the French took the initiative, the Prime Minister would agree.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Ambassador, I need an answer to the question I have put to you. We will look at the seven percent, if you will look at what can be done. Once we understand each other, then we can take a look at the problem of how we get you the A-7's without making it look as though you had backed down. I have no desire to embarrass the Prime Minister.</p>

The President will have a hard time because everyone expects him to do better. For an expert, it's easy to see Carter's foreign policy will be a disaster. For Carter to go to the right of the President is absurd; the structure of the Democratic Party won't allow it; his convictions won't allow it — a man who's come out against arms sales, for Italian Communist participation.

                        <p>The Prime Minister sent me to Mexico to have me put forward formally this proposal for a Third World Summit.</p>

                            </hi>: It was the Group of 77. But this upset the nonaligned conference quite a bit—that it would overshadow the Nonaligned Summit. The more I think of it, the more I think it will. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, the Latin Americans told me they think it would be good to bring the Nonaligned Summit down a notch or two.</p>

                        <p>I must say we were surprised by the reaction. The meeting took it as far as it could.</p>
                        <p>The other thing is a change for the better in the North Korean attitude. You know the resolution was withdrawn.</p>

                        <p>Now, theoretically, probably neither of you can discuss a proposal by the United States either. We ought to be able to come up with a formula.</p>
                        <p>You know our Congressional situation. We are probably coming up with a nonproliferation policy before Congress comes back. Because if we don't, Congress will legislate punitive measures.</p>

If Carter is elected, Congress and the President will act against you. I think he will be eager to make a dramatic initiative on the proliferation issue. He may not pick on Pakistan.</p>

                            </hi>: Your understanding of the Prime Minister's attitude was correct. I was wrong. The Prime Minister confirmed the understanding was as you had stated it. It could be a difference in nuancement.</p>

                        <p>I think it is better to know if you see no practical way to resolve the dilemma that neither side can go forward, or we should look for a formula.</p>
                        <p>It is inevitable that we will be in opposition. We have to be in opposition.</p>

                            </hi>: Even from a new administration, we will run up against the difficulty that it's something we have already done. The Prime Minister is being asked to back down under pressure. He's committed before his people. This should be taken into account by the President and Congress.</p>

                            </hi>: We will oppose it. How we oppose it, I don't know. It will depend on what we can negotiate before Congress returns. Unless we can negotiate, the more the Congress will pass. If you look at the human rights field.</p>

                        <p>I personally think the more punitive we are, the more we spread proliferation. Because we will make life difficult for France and Germany for a few years, and then they will build their own enrichment facilities, and it will be less manageable.</p>

                            </hi>: How do you see the Chinese mood? How do you see the speech yesterday [by Chiao Kuan-hua]?</p>

                            </hi>: There is an opinion among China-watchers that there is some division in the Chinese camp and some move to move closer to the Soviet Union. We don't see that — from our talks, from public statements. If there were some divisions, they couldn't continue this uncompromising stand.</p>

                            </hi>: They might make the loudest noises just before before they did it. But we have no evidence of it.</p>
                        <p>They have misread the American political scene. They have spent a year playing up to people opposed to us. You know it's had no impact whatsoever except to infuriate the Administration.</p>
                        <p>We at least think geopolitically. It's not necessarily the case [in U S. politics].</p>
                        <p>The speech yesterday. If we make agreements with the Soviet Union, we are appeasers. If we resist the Soviet Union, it's superpower competition against which the whole world should unite.</p>
                        <p>They have this idea we are trying to push the Soviet Union to the east.</p>

                                <persName>Ahmed</persName>
                            </hi>: Not push.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi>: If the Soviet Union attacks China, I personally think it would be a colossal strategic problem for the United States. It would be as serious as a Soviet attack on Europe. But it is technically harder for us to defend China because there is no treaty. I see if they attack Europe, they will face a massive American reaction; therefore it may be they are more likely to attack China. But if they do, Europe will collapse anyway. If they attack China and succeed, Europe will become like Finland.</p>
                        <p>So the idea that we are encouraging the Soviet Union to attack China is absurd.</p>
                        <p>I would move heaven and earth to defend China if the Soviet Union attacked. But I as a friend won't be able to mobilize support for it if they are constantly in a posture of hostility toward us.</p>
                        <p>You know how much I value the relationship. And my already strong friendship for Pakistan has a permanent base because of the role you played.</p>
                        <p>What strategy are they pursuing? What do they gain? I wanted to establish visible ties so we would have a basis for defending China.</p>
                        <p>You think geopolitically. You know if the Soviet Union attacked China, Japan would become a series of islands off the coast; India would be liberated [to act aggressively].</p>
                        <p>It has been the fixed principle of the United States to defend a unitary China — even before the Communists. This is based on geopolitical reality.</p>

                            </hi>: Of course. But you can speak [to them] as friends.</p>
                        <p>They can't just take a free ride. They can't just take from it and put nothing into it. If this continues, unilateralism will take hold. And this is precisely the situation which the Soviet Union could take advantage of.</p>

                            </hi>: In the last year, they have been better. Ch'iao Kuan-hua made precisely your case to me. He said: “They haven't done it all but we understand their difficulties.”</p>

                            </hi>: They are bringing about just the opposite of what they want. Every journalist there gets a lecture on appeasement.</p>
                        <p>Those in the United States who talk tough on strategic arms are the weakest geopolitically. The world will be lost by attacks in Angola and everywhere, not by the Soviet Union waking up one morning and attacking America.</p>

                        <p>I will say the same thing to Ch'iao. But we wouldn't object if you do it. You know, if we say something to China they don't like, it offends their pride.</p>
                        <p>Excessive sentimentality is not my problem, but there are some countries for whom I have a personal affection. China is one of them. I happen to think they handled the opening of our relationship with consummate skill and delicacy. The problem may be the inexperience of the top leadership.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: I am really pleased that <persName corresp="#p_SK2">KEWAL SINGH</persName> can attend the meeting. This is a good beginning to meet the Secretary on his first day in the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Your Ambassadors don't usually have much trouble seeing me even when our relations are troubled. You look fine. Can you sleep on the plane? I can't. I can sleep during the day but I don't like to fly at night. I can never sleep on a commercial plane. Sometimes I can rest a little if they have a bunk.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: It was a very bad flight. We were delayed 17 hours but I must confess I was praying that we would be here in time for the meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: How did you come? By Concorde?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: I came by Air India. I rushed straight from the airport here.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Well, you couldn't look fresher. Did you watch the debate? What did you think?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Yes, I did. What's the use of my views? I can't vote. I found it interesting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: I am glad there are no other foreign policy debates. It is bad for my nerves. I just want both parties to forget me. I am adopting a policy of non-alignment. (Laughter)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Shall I start raising my points? I am very pleased to meet you. I thought it would be easier to talk here in New York instead of coming down to Washington. Looking back since we met a year ago, I think Indo-U.S. relations have done reasonably well. I think we have <pb n="3" xml:id="d237-03" facs="d237-03"/>made progress toward putting things on a more stable basis. The credit goes to both countries. This is the basic point I would like to make.</p>
                        <p>A most important contribution has been made by the idea of having a Joint Commission. This mechanism has helped insulate our activities from the ups and downs of political changes. The work of the Joint Commission has made a contribution. Maybe some parts of the Commission have had problems, but on the whole my people tell me that things are proceeding, although I don't want to overdo the progress that is being made by the Subcommissions.</p>
                        <p>As you will recall, we have three of them: Science and Technology, Education and Culture, and Economics and Trade. Now we think the Science and Technology group has gotten off to a good start. It has identified many areas of potential cooperation. It has done particularly good work in the energy field. They had a very good solar energy conference. I know it was not possible to have a Joint Commission meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Yes, because the next one needs to be in India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: But our impression is that the financial input on the U.S. side has not been fully forthcoming to fund various projects.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: What is this?</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi>: The problem is that most agencies have to finance programs out of their budgets. This is a normal limitation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: But what does this mean in practice with regard to India?</p>

                            </hi>: There has been a problem with the cultural group.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Yes, that is the one.</p>

                            </hi>: The difficulty relates to a program for an exchange of scholars. This comes out of the CU budget which has been cut.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: The Education and Culture group has not done much work. This is a problem area. Things need to be expedited.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Well, you will get a lesson on how our government functions. Only now I have a glimmer after three years in office. Things get done because of a series of treaties between different bureaus.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: You see, you don't tell me unless you need my help. I think someone might do a paper telling me what happened.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: I was impressed by all the chairmen when we met last year.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: On the Economic Subcommission our main interest is in trade. Even with the increase in trade, we are still only 0.7 percent of U.S. imports. That's a small share. There is still much that can be done but the group is working on it.</p>
                        <p>The Business Council led by Orville Freeman came to India. They had a good meeting but some government support is needed for the Joint Business Council. Frankly, we feel that there was coolness on the official side toward the Business Council.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Now I think the Joint Commission on a whole has made progress. It is doing a good job and I don't want to overdo these comments which should merely be regarded as footnotes.</p>
                        <p>The next subject is the question of fuel supply at Tarapur. You and your Administration have taken a correct stand. We appreciate this, even though we are not sure about the future. As you know, the plant is located in the most industrialized part of India. It provides about 15 percent of the power for Maharashtra and Gujarat States. If we do not get an assured power supply, it will badly affect our industries. I would greatly appreciate your assessment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Part of the problem is an internal U.S. matter. At present the NRC has the autonomous right to decide licensing. If this continues, there will be profound implications for our nuclear export policy. No country will be sure of getting fuel from us since the NRC will be able to change the criteria. My position is that countries living up to their agreements with us should be assured of their fuel <pb n="6" xml:id="d237-06" facs="d237-06"/>supply and we should not change the provisions of the agreement after the fact. The bill we were supporting with the Congress would have put the NRC under Executive Branch control. The President's nuclear proposals will also call for this. Other countries need the assurance they will get fuel. Otherwise, they will seek alternate fuel supplies or develop their own, thereby magnifying the proliferation risks.</p>
                        <p>Now, India is caught in this problem with the NRC which is trying to impose additional conditions. The Administration does not approve of your proliferation, but is opposed to using licenses as a way to impose a new condition. When the new act passes, we will be able to enforce our view on the NRC.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: If you think we are difficult, wait until Carter comes in, if he does. Unless his mother has special influence on him, you are in for trouble.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: We would like some guarantee that we will get the fuel. As far as this supply is concerned, it is fully protected by international safeguards. We did not know that the buyback would involve a heavy subsidy. Why is this?</p>

                            </hi>: The agreement provides for the buyback but does not provide any financial details. That is why we are discussing the question of costs. What are the figures?</p>

                            </hi>: Returning the existing spent fuel stored at Tarapur will cost about $12 million. Thereafter the running cost each year for the return of spent fuel will be about $3 million.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Why are you insisting on the buyback?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Our concern is not to have reprocessing in India.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Vellodi</hi>: Part of the problem is that at the time we built Tarapur with American help, we also put up a reprocessing plant. You knew about this then and helped us. Otherwise, there was no point in building the reprocessing plant. The return of the spent fuel makes the reprocessing plant useless. We have written you a letter asking for a joint determination on the safeguardability of the reprocessing plant. It is true the buyback provision is in the agreement. But this speaks of material in excess of our needs. It doesn't talk of all the spent fuel. This would be a departure from the agreement. It would put the reprocessing plant out of business. It would be uneconomical to transport spent fuel there from Rajasthan so we have a problem. But we would also like you to take the spent fuel, especially now since we have inadequate storage space.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi>: This gets back to the basic problem which, as the Secretary indicated, relates to the NRC. They have insisted on buyback if we want them to approve the license.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: I would like to go on to area problems.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: We need a basic determination in our own government. I don't like the situation where we impose conditions on agreements afterwards. This makes proliferation more likely. My inclination is to find alternate solutions but the NRC is totally independent. We need to get the law changed. Right now we have no discretion unless the law can be changed. You know, some of the people, that worked for me are now on the NRC. <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> is there, also many others who used to work for me are with Carter. But they are second raters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: How about Pakistan? You must have heard about the new package agreement. This went off very well.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: There was also a plane hijacked recently in Pakistan. The Pakistanis acted correctly in returning the plane but they did not return the hijackers.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Oh?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: They say they are looking into the matter but don't know who did it or why they did it.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Didn't the hijackers tell the passengers?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Not really. Apart from this the only problem is that Bhutto continues to talk about Kashmir. They raised this again at the U.N. We had to reply. When we met in 1975, the question of arms came up. You were good enough to write me and gave me assurances.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: We kept these.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Yes, that is right, you kept them. But now we hear rumors about sales of more sophisticated weapons. We are not concerned about nuclear weapons but the supply of conventional arms will create problems for us, such as A-7s.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Vellodi</hi>: Also Sidewinders.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: This is one point I would like to make. We appreciate what you have done. This has been helpful and the package with Pakistan went through because there was no trouble in the arms supply field. We think you should maintain this position.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: We have not made a decision on supplying more advanced weapons. Occasionally we get requests but no decisions have been made. There are two problems. When you look at the military situation, there is no foreseeable level of U.S. arms supply to Pakistan that would redress the military balance. We have no interest in changing the situation in the subcontinent or in producing a balance of power situation in South Asia. This would force us into a massive supply arrangement and would produce an inevitable reaction on your part. I can foresee no circumstances where we would do this.</p>
                        <p>The second problem relates to Pakistan's giving up its reprocessing plans. If they do, we think we could ease <pb n="9" xml:id="d237-09" facs="d237-09"/>some of the supply policy limitations. In the absence of Pakistan's making concessions in the nuclear area, however, I do not foresee any changes in the arms supply field, except perhaps some minor ones. I have told the Pakistanis that if they are willing to forego their nuclear plans, we would be able to expand our conventional arms supply.</p>
                        <p>The weird thing about this is that Pakistan cannot establish a conventional arms balance. Even with the A-7s you are bound to win any war, but if they get nuclear devices there will then be a balance. Frankly, we are trying to get them to give up the idea. If I were the Prime Minister of Pakistan, I would do exactly what <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is doing. Not listen to me. I made some strong public statements in Lahore which did not make me very popular there. If they get 10-15 nuclear devices, whatever they are called, the effect will be to make India and Pakistan equal. Thus, in a funny way, your getting nuclear devices produced a situation in which equality is again possible where it was not possible through conventional weapons.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Perhaps that is so in the long term but our thinking is that conventional weapons supply from the outside is a greater threat to instability in the area right now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Would you apply that also to the Soviet supply of arms to India?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Why not?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Our position is as I stated that unless Pakistan makes significant concessions in the nuclear area, we will not have a basis for an expansion of our arms supply.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: They already have more than they need.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Not enough against you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: But our needs are different. Secretary: Our position is that we are not going to stir up an arms race in the subcontinent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Your restraint has been helpful. We see the political dividends in the package agreed with Pakistan.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Frankly, turning away from arms questions, I am not so conscious as you that our relations have improved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Well, they haven't deteriorated. They have been stable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Yes, I guess so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: We have been dealing better with problems and avoiding troubles.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: If I were to make an assessment, we have gone back from the level reached in October 1974 when I was in Delhi but not as far back as 1971. The combination of your nuclear action and domestic developments about which I don't comment has created problems. There have also been public statements of some of your leaders about the U.S. although these have been muted recently. Now that you have press control, you can no longer talk about these as spontaneous.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: There are also some irritants on our side. There are the Fraser hearings on human rights in India. It was an exercise to keep the Indian Parliament quiet.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: As I have said publicly, I am in total disagreement with Fraser. He would make us the world's policeman. There are certain human rights which are important.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: One of the people who appeared, Jethmalani is now boasting he has gotten asylum in the U.S. for criticizing us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: It is inevitable that the Fraser Committee hears witnesses who are violently opposed to the government in power. You are not the only case. Every time I see a Foreign Minister, he has some complaint. We certainly would not take kindly to India's holding hearings on civil rights in the U.S. These hearings are superficial. It is an outrageous procedure.</p>
                        <p>You are now suffering the reverse of the romanticism of the 1950's and 60's. I took a more sober view of relations then. I do now. I try to hold to the view that our relations are not based on internal affairs but on your external policy. India is an increasingly important country and we have to deal with the realities. It is <pb n="11" xml:id="d237-11" facs="d237-11"/>precisely for that reason that we have not gone on a crusading venture. We do take seriously, however, what you say about <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and allegations of U.S. interference or destabilization. I told you when I was in India that if you find any American interfering with your affairs, we will get him out in 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>I am also concerned about the trend in the non-aligned movement. It cannot be that on every issue we are wrong and the Soviet Union is right. Why does the so-called non-aligned movement parallel the Soviet viewpoint on every issue? Look at the record of the Colombo Conference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: That is not so. On many issues we have independent views. We took account of U.S. sensitivities at Colombo. You made your points to us on Puerto Rico and Korea and we acted accordingly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Did India reserve?</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Yes, we took into account your sensitivities quite deliberately.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: As long as this is done, we do not ask for more.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: We made these decisions deliberately.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: We have also taken your sensitivities into account. This is shown in the way we have made our arms supply to Pakistan an essentially token affair.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Vellodi</hi>: Not only India but 23-24 other countries entered reservations at Colombo. I think this was a factor in explaining why the Korean issue has not come up in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: The North Koreans tried to canvass on this and we told them we did not enter our reservation in a lighthearted manner.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: In addition to moderating political issues, we have also placed a stress on moderation rather than confrontation in the economic field. In Lima the climate on the <pb n="12" xml:id="d237-12" facs="d237-12"/>Puerto Rico issue changed after we switched our position.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: Non-alignment is our fundamental policy but we are careful in the presentation of issues that we strengthen not weaken the movement.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: It is odd when a bloc which has more than half of the U.N. membership tries to bind members before the U.N. session. This introduces a new reality in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: The basic point to keep in mind is that you show awareness for our sensitivities. We don't ask for your support. We ask that you just keep our sensitivities in mind.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: We are interested in a prosperous and stable Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: You can't say I didn't warn you in 1971. It is in the nature of Bengali nationalism and the inevitable consequences of a small state confronted by a powerful neighbor that causes trouble. We face it too. We tell Bangladesh they should seek their future in friendly relations with India. It is inconceivable for us to play games with Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: They are trying to imitate others. The Farakka Barrage is essentially a technical problem. They are trying to internationalize it. We offered a good solution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: But they say it is not a good solution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: They say no to our proposals, but don't say why. We need to get the technical people talking. Your advice to <pb n="13" xml:id="d237-13" facs="d237-13"/>Bangladesh would be most useful.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: We have no interest in getting into the middle in this problem. We are not interested in Bangladeshis becoming an irritant to India, but we do hope that you can find a generous solution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: We made a generous offer, but they are making an impossible proposal. They want to set up a storage system throughout the Ganges. They are also running around in the U.N.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Vellodi</hi>: When their delegation came to India last month, we said we were willing to share the water of the Ganges during the lean months more or less equally. They said no.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: What is your position now?</p>
                        <p>Vellodi The problem exists only in the dry season.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Are you taking all the water?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: No, not all.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Ambassador</hi>: We are willing to be reasonable. We were taking more than half but are now offering about a 50-50 split. Look at the record over the years. First, the Pakistanis and then the Bangladeshis increased the amount of water they said they need. First it was 3,000, then 5,000, then 8,000, and finally 50,000 cusecs. Now they want all the water.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: We offered 50 per cent. Last year we took 40,000 cusecs and gave them 15,000 cusecs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Vellodi</hi>: In fact, although this was the formula, we only took 35,000 cusecs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: We need the water badly for Calcutta.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: We are prepared to use what influence we have with Bangladesh to encourage moderation and friendly relations with India. Tension can only create a messy situation. The two countries are so unequal that anyone getting involved would get no benefits and get badly burned. We are not interested in internationalizing this issue but it is another question for us to oppose inscription at the U.N.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: Why do we have to?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Minister, I enjoyed your coming in. The U.S. will not put forward a position on what is equitable. Of course, the side that has the dam has a substantial advantage. Although I have not studied the problem, I hope you will be generous.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: There is only one more point. China. We took the initiative and they have responded. We have now exchanged ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: They didn't criticize you in their speech at the U.N.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: But they supported all our neighbors. We don't expect immediate results. We have hope and patience and will make the effort to improve relations with China. Could you give us your assessment on Southern Africa? We have only read about this in the newspapers and we don't know what to believe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: We have had a fundamental breakthrough with <persName corresp="#p_SRB2">Smith</persName>'s acceptance of the principal of majority rule for Rhodesia and his agreement to negotiate for a constitution. Inevitably in Africa there are five presidents and four leaders of liberation movements who, of necessity, must demonstrate that they have earned independence on their own and cannot acknowledge that it has come through the U.S. There is much noise but they never say in their press statements exactly what they are rejecting. There is plenty of room left to arrive at a reasonable outcome.</p>
                        <pb n="15" xml:id="d237-15" facs="d237-15"/>
                        <p>We made <persName corresp="#p_SRB2">Smith</persName> be specific. We forced him to agree to things. We believe it would be helpful if there was less talk. The British should call a conference. The more theoretical discussion there is, the more trouble there will be. The fundamental breakthrough has been achieved. You know from your own experience that once a decision for independence is made, the remaining whites will have to adjust to the new realities. On the other hand, if the blacks push things beyond a certain point, they will create a panic. The Africans should accept the process which is giving them 80 per cent of what they want. This is what is happening in Namibia. The issue is how to disengage South Africa. If the terms are too difficult, the South Africans will be prepared to fight. South Africa says that SWAPO is a group of murderers but they are willing to have a U.N. conference in which SWAPO will participate and a delegation will come from Windhoeck. There would also be a South African representative who will have responsibility to negotiate on the issues. Once the conference gets put together, the outcome is inevitable. What we cannot bring about, however, is to declare SWAPO the government today. We can only arrange for South Africa to negotiate this. There would be no great tragedy for the U.S. if war came to Southern Africa. But once a conference is assembled with South Africa, they will fix a date for independence. What other outcome would be possible? Perhaps one year. This would allow time for South Africa to adjust to the new situation. Some African leaders seem to understand this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi>: What time frame do you see?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: It would take about 6 weeks to call a conference. Independence should come in about two years. If the Africans decide to fight, they won't get their independence from South Africa in two years, and if they make too extreme demands, South Africa will decide that its future depends on retaining a link to Namibia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign minister</hi>: The Africans told me they thought you would deal first with Namibia and then with Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Secretary</hi>: I thought so at first also. But Rhodesia turned out to be easier. I think this is practical. We are not asking you to do anything but to the extent you have influence, we hope you will use it to urge moderation. This would be appreciated.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Prime Minister received the Ambassador very shortly after he arrived in her outer office. She had, a clean desk, a pleasant smile and a very relaxed and easy appearance. She was most attractively dressed and looked rested and completely composed. As the Ambassador arrived and was seated, she smiled pleasantly but said little.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador opened the conversation talking about his family, about his appreciation for her having received his son and daughter-in-law and about his returning to the United States to see a new granddaughter for the first time. The Ambassador commented on how accessible the Prime Minister was, saying that we were embarrassed sometimes by the number of people for whom we relayed requests for appointments, but she seemed to see them all, for which we were grateful. The Prime Minister replied that she saw a number of other Americans as well. The Ambassador discussed the transition taking place in Washington, commenting on President-elect Carter's style and noting that the new Ambassador to India might not be appointed for some months. The Prime Minister commented that she understood Mr. Carter was very systematic in his approach to work.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador remarked that the only problem between the US and India remaining seemed to be the nuclear one and that US views on this subject related to many countries and not just India. Speaking personally, <pb n="2" xml:id="d238-02" facs="d238-02"/>the Ambassador said his candidate to be his successor was Senator Pastore who is retiring undefeated from the Senate. Pastore was a most intelligent and reasonable person who believed the United States should fulfill its commitments to export nuclear fuel. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> offered no comment.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador, who had just returned from a luncheon with the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, commented on the 70% increase in the exports of Indian industrial products to the United States and discussed other trade matters which had come up at that luncheon.</p>
                        <p>After 15 or 20 minutes of conversation, the Ambassador prepared to rise and, while doing so, said that he thought US-India relations had improved during his time in India and he expressed an appreciation for the part for which Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName> had played. She replied that she agreed relations had improved and considered that he had played an important role in this process. The Prime Minister then said that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was grateful for the Ambassador's achievements and asked that he convey her warm regards to Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_SWB2">Saxbe</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Gandhi</persName>'s part in this conversation was largely non-substantive and, as is usually the case, she said little herself. However, her approach was warm and friendly and her farewell quite cordial.</p>

                            </hi>: They used to take me apart until some order was restored. I went to India in the 1960's as an advisor to the last Democratic administration. It was at a time when India had Galbraith as the American Ambassador and Pakistan had a career man. So the Pakistanis felt aggrieved as it was.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d239-02" facs="d239-02"/>
                        <p>Galbraith, of course, was having heart attacks at the thought of my wandering around unescorted. The first time I had a press conference, I was asked whether or not I thought Pakistan would attack India in order to solve the Kashmir dispute. I said I didn't think Pakistan would be so foolish as to do anything like that. Notwithstanding the fact that it was complimentary to Pakistan, the fact that I mentioned Pakistan and foolish in the same breath lead to an uproar in the Pakistani press. So I traveled the remainder of the time in India as a national hero while the Pakistan press was beating me to death. Three days later I was with Ayub Khan and I said: “I didn't think you'd receive me after the scandal in the press.” He smiled. Then at dinner later that evening when I got up to give the toast, I forgot momentarily that the Ayub/<persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> letters were secret and I mentioned them saying that they represented an example of the best of diplomacy. Ayub almost dropped his glass. But I give them great credit. Not a peep appeared in the Pakistani press. A day later I was touring in Kashmir and I received a message from Bundy saying that the President had ordered him to wire me: “If you open your mouth once more, I will push the recall button.”</p>
                        <p>Well, I wanted to talk very briefly, Mr. Ambassador, about the subject you and I know so well. Hank will be going back on Monday. The message he all carry is one that your Prime Minister can think about. Frankly, I can't add to our last conversation. It is very important, I think, however, to stress that the French would not be heartbroken if there were a cancellation or a delay in the implementation of the nuclear reprocessing agreement. I think I can assure you that the new American administration will make a massive effort toward this end, and they would like nothing better than to have somebody to make an example of. There is no leader to whom I feel personally more attached than your Prime Minister.</p>

                            </hi>: (continuing) Therefore, what we need to do is find a formula which avoids causing him a personal problem and yields him the greatest possible tangible benefit. I would like to note at this point that we have given no publicity to the matter and we will give no publicity to it; we will not cause a public issue which will embarrass the Prime Minister. If cancellation is a problem for you, let me suggest that perhaps delay or postponement be used as an explanation. On our side, I can assure you that we will come up with a military package including A-7's, perhaps a reactor — even a French reactor — possibly with United States credit. I would also pledge to you to make an effort to get Carter <pb n="3" xml:id="d239-03" facs="d239-03"/>and Vance signed up before this comes about. I know you have no instructions and I also assume that we agreed that if we both knew two years ago what we now know, we would not be meeting here. But when you see an express train coming down the track, it seems only prudent to get out of its way. I would hate very much to see Pakistan become the first object of a desire by a new Administration to score something. But I want to make absolutely clear, if the Prime Minister turns us down, we will do nothing and I emphasize nothing to embarrass Pakistan. There will be no big headlines. We will not use this to build public pressure against you.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">YAQUB</hi>: Well, Mr. Secretary, I know you appreciate the sensitivity that this causes us. I would like to suggest that perhaps we try to defer this (referring to trying to find a solution) until after Pakistan's elections.</p>

                        <list>
                            <item>— India's military imports during the last half of 1976 totaled about $108 million compared to $75 million for Pakistan. This raises the total for all of 1976 to $207 million for India and $164 million for Pakistan.</item>
                            <item>— The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> remained India's major supplier and this relationship is likely to continue. The most significant Indian imports were 180 SA-6 missiles — India's first receipt of this low altitude missile system — and the first five of 70 MIG-21 Bis aircraft. The Soviets are also suspected to have approved New Delhi's request to produce MIG-21 Bis fighters under license in India.</item>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d240-03" facs="d240-03"/>
                            <item>— China remained Pakistan's key military supplier, but France has become an increasingly important source of sophisticated equipment. France recently supplied Pakistan with its first surface-to-air missiles. Pledges by Middle Eastern countries to provide funds to Pakistan for military purchases rose sharply, but few purchases have yet been made with these funds.</item>
                            <item>— Both countries continue to develop their overall nuclear programs, but in the last six months neither has made significant new progress toward a nuclear weapons capability. Some important developments, however, have occurred:
<list>
                                    <item>— Heavy water imported by India from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> this past fall is for use in the second Rajasthan reactor and will almost certainly be subject to <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards. Nevertheless, these imports will enable India to save domestically produced heavy water for the CIRUS reactor and for certain reactors under construction which are not safeguarded and are therefore potential sources of plutonium for weapons.</item>
                                    <item>— There have been discussions about possible cancellation or postponement of the sale of a reprocessing plant by France to Pakistan. The deal, however, is not yet dead. Such a plant would be an essential acquisition if Pakistan were to construct its own nuclear device.</item>
                                    <pb n="4" xml:id="d240-04" facs="d240-04"/>
                                    <item>The net impact of the military equipment received by India and Pakistan in 1976 has not significantly affected India's overwhelming military superiority.</item>
                                    <item>— The 110 A-7 fighter bombers Pakistan has asked to buy from the US would improve Pakistan's ground support and air interdiction capabilities, but not significantly enhance its position vis-à-vis India.<note n="*" target="d240fn*">The Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, does not believe that the brief accompanying commentary is sufficient to support the judgment that Pakistan's acquisition of A-7s would “not significantly enhance its position vis-à-vis India.” The subject requires, in the opinion of State/<gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>, more comprehensive consideration of the psychological and political implications in both India and Pakistan. State/<gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> notes, moreover, that the response called for by <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 289 does not include discussion of hypothetical sales but is limited to discussion of cumulative arms shipments, deliveries, and contracts during the previous six months.</note> Indian modernization programs already underway in the air defense field largely negate the increased threat that Pakistani A-7s would pose. The Indians, moreover, probably would further improve their low altitude defense system and intensify their efforts to purchase deep penetration strike aircraft from either Britain, France, Sweden, or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. (India has been considering such purchases for several years.)</item>

                        <p>IT WAS DEEPLY TOUCHING TO READ YOUR REFERENCE TO MY MOTHER'S VOLUNTEER WORK IN INDIA. SHE HAS, AS DO SO MANY AMERICANS, A GREAT LOVE FOR YOUR COUNTRY.</p>
                        <p>MRS. Carter AND I ARE MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR CORDIAL INVITATION TO VISIT INDIA. WHILE WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS FOR OFFICIAL VISITS ABROAD IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE WILL BEAR YOUR KIND INVITATION IN MIND.</p>
                        <p>WITH BEST WISHES,</p>

                    <p>SUMMARY: SIKKIM APPEARS TO BE QUIETING DOWN FOLLOWING TAKE-OVER OF ADMINISTRATION BY <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND APPOINTMENT OF INDIAN OFFICIAL AS CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR. MEA TELLS US THAT IT HAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY CHINESE REACTION TO SIKKIM DEVELOPMENTS. END SUMMARY.</p>
                    <p>1. REPORTS IN DELHI PAPERS FROM GANGTOK SAY THAT THE LEADERS OF THE “ JOINT ACTION COUNCIL” WHO SPEARHEADED THE UNREST HAVE ASKED THEIR VOLUNTEERS TO INSURE A SWIFT RETURN TO NORMALCY. THE JOINT ACTION COUNCIL, SET UP BY POLITICIANS OF THE TWO NEPALI DOMINATED SIKKIM CONGRESS PARTIES, HAVE BEEN PRESSING FOR POLITICAL REFORMS AND INDIAN INTERVENTION. ITS LEADERS REPORTEDLY CONTINUE TO DEMAND CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES IN SIKKIM, INCLUDING DISMANTLING OF CHOGYAL RULE.</p>
                    <p>2. MEA JOINT SECRETARY FOR EAST ASIA PARANJPE TOLD THE POLITICAL COUNSELOR THAT SO FAR AS THE INDIANS KNOW THERE HAS BEEN NO REACTION BY THE CHINESE TO DEVELOPMENTS IN SIKKIM. PARANJPE THOUGHT THAT IN FACT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT THE CHINESE WOULD STIR UP A FUSS OVER SIKKIM AT A TIME WHEN THEY APPEAR TO BE INTERESTED IN NOVING GRADUALLY TOWARD BETTER RELATIONS WITH INDIA.</p>
                    <p>3. MEA SECRETARY (WEST) AVTAR SINGH, WHOM THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> SENT TO SIKKIM ON APRIL 4 TO ASSESS THE SITUATION, HAS RETURNED TO DELHI. WE WILL SEE HIM LATER THIS WEEK. ACCORDING TO THE INDIAN WIRE SERVICE, AVTAR SINGH TOLD THE PRESS IN CALCUTTA ON THE WAY BACK TO DELHI THAT THE CHOGYAL WOULD REMAIN THE “ CONSTITUTIONAL HEAD” OF SIKKIM AND THAT THE GOI ADMINISTRATION WOULD “ EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCES OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES THERE AND WOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN DUE COURSE.”</p>
                    <p>4. THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS SENT B. S. DAS, COMMISSIONER OF THE DELHI MUNICIPAL CORPORATION AND FORMER INDIAN REPRESENTATIVE IN BHUTAN, TO TAKE OVER AS CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR, REVIVING INDIA' S EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY IN SIKKIM.</p>
                    <p>5. DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SURENDRA PAL SINGH MADE A STATEMENT (<gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">SEPTEL</gloss>) TO THE LOK SABHA ON APRIL 9 EXPLAINING THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>' S ACTION IN TERMS OF POLARIZATION BETWEEN “ MAHARAJA” AND “ POPULARLY ELECTED POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE MASSES.” HE SAID THAT THE GOI HAD TAKEN OVER THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE CHOGYAL' S REQUEST AND “ AT THE DEMAND OF THE PEOPLE OF SIKKIM.” POPULAR AND ELECTED LEADERS, HE ADDED, HAVE WELCOMED GOI ACCEPTANCE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MAINTAINING LAW AND ORDER AND RUNNING THE ADMINISTRATION OF SIKKIM.</p>
                    <p>6. COMMENT: WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE HERE THAT <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> STIRRED UP CURRENT TROUBLE IN SIKKIM. BASIC ELEMENTS FOR DISCONTENT WERE ALREADY THERE UNDER SYSTEM WHICH TRIED TO BALANCE INDIGENOUS MINORITY AND SEVENTY- FIVE PERCENT NEPALI POPULATION. NEPALI GRIEVANCES AND MUTUAL SUSPICIONS OF INDIANS AND CHOGYAL CIRCLE HAVE LONG HISTORY. AT SAME TIME,<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> OFFICIALS HAVE HAD CLOSE CONTACTS WITH NEPALI POLITICIANS OVER THE YEARS. DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER' S STATEMENT AND DELHI PRESS PLAY CERTAINLY INDICATE SATISFACTION WITH OUTCOME OF RECENT AGITATION.</p>
                    <p>7. WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW, I ASSUME, IS THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> WILL RUN SIKKIM AS IT DID BEFORE WHEN AN INDIAN ADMINISTRATOR WAS IN CHARGE. THE LAST ADMINISTRATOR, I. S. CHOPRA, LEFT SIKKIM IN MAY 1972 AND, AT THE CHOGYAL' S INSISTENCE, WAS NOT REPLACED. THE INDIANS ARE UNLIKELY, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM, TO LET THE CHOGYAL TAKE BACK EVEN THE LIMITED DEGREE OF INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY THAT HE HAS ENJOYED IN THE PAST. FOR THE INDIANS, THE LONGER TERM PROBLEM WILL BE TO WORK OUT A REPRESENTATIONAL SYSTEM THAT WILL SATISFY THE 75 PERCENT NEPALI MAJORITY, PROTECT RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS MINORITY, AND PRESERVE CHOGYAL AS TITULAR CHIEF OF STATE. INDIAN TROOPS ALREADY STATIONED IN SIKKIM. INDIA CONTROLS SIKKIM' S DEFENSE, EXTERNAL POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS, AND COMMUNICATIONS UNDER THE 1950 TREATY WITH SIKKIM. INDIANS WILL PROBABLY PREFER TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING TREATY RELATIONSHIP RATHER THAN GO FORWARD TO FULL INCORPORATION OF SIKKIM INTO INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE INDIA WITH AMPLE DEFENSE AND ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY IN SENSITIVE BORDER AREA AND AVOID ADDING NEW TROUBLED TRIBAL/ LINGUISTIC ELEMENT TO INDIAN POLITICAL BODY.</p>

WHILE OFFICIAL CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">SEPTEL</gloss>S, WHAT EMERGED FROM VISIT IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HIGHLIGHT IN MORE GENERAL ASSESSMENT. THEMES GON STRESSED THROUGHOUT TALKS WERE DRAWN FROM UNUSALLY LUCID BRIEF PREPARED BY NEPALESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (WE SUSPECT AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_KYN1">KHANAL</persName> WAS AUTHOR) FOR INTERNAL GON USE DURING DEPSEC'S VISIT, COPY OF WHICH FOREIGN MINISTRY GAVE AMBASSADOR LAISE ON APRIL 18, JUST PRIOR TO DEPSEC'S ARRIVAL (TEXT BEING POUCHED. COINCIDING WITH DEPSEC'S VISIT WAS WEEK-LONG VISIT BY HARVARD POLITICAL SCIENTIST KARL DEUTSCH WHO HELD BRILLIANT SEMINAR FOR TOP NEPALESE LEADERS FOR TWO DAYS PRECEDING DEPSEC'S VISIT (KATHMANDU 1693); DEUTSCH ALSO HAD LONG SESSION WITH KING (WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF DEUTSCH'S PRIZE STUDENTS AT HARVARD. NEPALESE ATTITUDES DISPLAYED DURING DEUTSCH VISIT, PLUS GON BRIEF FOR DEPSEC VISIT, HAVE BEEN DRAWN ON IN ADDITION TO STATEMENTS AND OTHER INDICATIONS OF NEPALESE POLICY ELICITED DURING DEPSEC'S VISIT, AS RAW MATERIALS FOR EMBASSY ASSESSMENT WHICH CONSTITUTES BALANCE OF THIS MESSAGE.</item>

                        <item>HEGEMONY AND REGIONAL POWERS: INDIA'S ASSUMPTION OF SUBCONTINENTAL PREEMINENCE AS ONE OF NEW REALITIES IN WAKE OF 1971 WAR IS INCREASINLY DISTURBING TO NEPALESE, WHO ARE PROBING FOR ITS IMPLICATIONS AND FEARING WORST. FOREIGN MINISTRY BRIEF INCLUDES STATEMENTS SUCH AS THIS: “WHILE WELCOMING THE GENERAL TREND TOWARDS DETENTE, BECAUSE OF OUR BASIC STAKE AT PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT, HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT HOPES THAT THE SMALLER COUNTRIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE THEIR OWN DESTINY IN EXERCISE OF THEIR SOVEREIGN RIGHTS. HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT FEELS THAT ANY TRADING OF THE DESTINIES OF SMALLER POWERS IN THE INTEREST OF EITHER GLOBAL OR REGIONAL OR SUB-REGIONAL BALANCE OF POWER WILL AGGRAVATE RATHER THAN REDUCE TENSION.” WHEN DEUTSCH ARGUED THAT CURRENT TRENDS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS HAD SHARPLY LIMITED CAPACITY OF SUPERPOWERS TO PURSUE HEGEMONISTIC POLICIES VIS-À-VIS WEAKER AND SMALLER COUNTRIES, CHIRAN THAPA, PALACE AIDE AND FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR TO KING, REACTED BY <pb n="3" xml:id="d243-03" facs="d243-03"/>EXPOUNDING TO MISSION OFFICIAL HIS VIEW THAT THESE SAME TRENDS ALSO MADE IT EASIER AND MORE FEASIBLE FOR MIDDLE-RANKING REGIONAL POWERS (READ INDIA) TO PURSUE HEGEMONISTIC AMBITIONS TOWARD SMALLER NEIGHBORS.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>INDIA AND THE SOVIET UNION: NEPALESE LEADERS PERCEIVE INDIA AS THE MAJOR POTENTIAL THREAT TO FUTURE INTEGRITY OF NEPALESE NATION, AND CONSTRUE INDO-SOVIET TREATY AS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THIS THREAT. SOVIET SUPPORT FOR INDIA IN REGIONAL CONTEXT IS THUS VIEWED AS AT LEAST POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING FACTOR. FOREIGN MINISTRY DRAFT BRIEF HINTS AT THESE CONCERNS IN FOLLOWING STATEMENT: “BESIDES, ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES ON THE ONE HAND AND INDIA AND CHINA ON THE OTHER IS WELCOME TO US. HOWEVER, ANY SUCH IMPROVEMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS AND NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE SMALLER COUNTRIES OF THE REGION. ALTHOUGH WITH THE SIGNING OF THE INDO-SOVIET PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY, THE INDIAN NATIONALISM MAY NOT COMPROMISE WITH SOVIET INTEREST, IT HAS HELPED FURTHER INDIA'S PREDOMINANCE IN THE REGION AND HAS COMPLICATED THE SOLUTION OF THE REGIONAL ISSUES INCLUDING THE SINO-INDIA BORDER PROBLEM.” AS RESULT OF DEUTSCH TALKS HERE, WE HAVE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT KING BIRENDRA PERSONALLY HAS DEEP-SEATED FEAR OF INDIAN INTENTIONS, HEIGHTENED BY A SENSE THAT PM <persName corresp="#p_GI2">GANDHI</persName> ACTS FAR MORE RUTHLESSLY AND DECISIVELY TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS FOR INDIA THAN DID HER LATE FATHER. WHILE NEPALESE LEADERS, INCLUDING KING, RECOGNIZE THAT PRESENT INDIAN STANCE TOWARD NEPAL RESPECTS NEPALESE SOVEREIGNTY AND IS BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH NEPAL'S OWN INTERESTS, NEPALESE FEAR THAT SITUATION COULD CHANGE VIRTUALLY OVERNIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY SENSE THAT IF INTERNAL DISORDER SHOULD ERUPT IN NEPAL, AS IT DID RECENTLY IN SIKKIM, THEN INDIA, EMBOLDENED BY SOVIET SUPPORT, COULD FEEL COMPELLED BY PERCEPTIONS OF ITS OWN <pb n="4" xml:id="d243-04" facs="d243-04"/>STRATEGIC INTERESTS TO INTERVENE BY FORCE IF NECESSARY, BUT CERTAINLY IN WAYS THAT WOULD CLEARLY — AND PERMANENTLY — ESTABLISH SUPREMACY OF INDIAN INFLUENCE. THIS APPARENTLY WAS WHAT KING HAD IN MIND WHEN HE REMARKED TO DEPSEC <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">RUSH</persName> (AS REPORTED IN NEW DELHI 4657) THAT INTERNAL STABILITY WAS BEST CONTRIBUTION NEPAL COULD MAKE TO REGIONAL STABILITY. THIS ALSO EXPLAINS CLOSE ATTENTION KING AND VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER POLITICALLY ALERT NEPALESE HAVE BEEN PAYING TO DEVELOPMENTS IN SIKKIM, INCLUDING AN EFFORT TO ESTIMATE EXTENT TO WHICH INDIA INSTIGATED DISTURBANCES AS OPPOSED MERELY TO REACTING TO THEM.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>IMPORTANCE OF US ROLE: AS FIRST VISIT OF HIGH RANKING DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS TO NEPAL, DEPSEC'S ARRIVAL PROVIDED UNIQUE OCCASION FOR GON TO EXPRESS VALUE IT ATTACHES TO ITS RELATIONS WITH US, AND GON MADE MOST OF OPPORTUNITY. DEPSEC AND PARTY WERE TREATED AS GUESTS OF GOVERNMENT. KING GAVE VISITORS AUDIENCE DESPITE FACT THAT VISIT COINCIDED WITH <pb n="5" xml:id="d243-05" facs="d243-05"/>OFFICIAL MOURNING PERIOD FOR LATE QUEEN GRANDMOTHER. AND, OF COURSE, PRIVATE TALKS AND RECORD OF CONVERSATIONS WITH KING, PRIME MINISTER, AND FOREIGN MINISTER, AS WELL AS CONTENTS OF FOREIGN MINISTRY INTERNAL BRIEF, ALL ECHO REFRAIN OF HIGH REGARD NEPALESE HAVE FOR US AND FOR WHAT US HAS DONE FOR NEPAL. IN PARTICULAR, <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> REJOICED THAT US NOW SEES ITS INTERESTS IN NEPAL AS DIRECTLY BILATERAL AND NOT DERIVATIVE OF ITS INTERESTS IN ANY THIRD COUNTRY (I.E., INDIA). KING STRESSED THIS POINT PARTICULARLY. WHEN DEPSEC STRESSED SAME POINT IN HIS TOAST THE FOLLOWING DINNER FOREIGN MINISTER HOSTED FOR HIM APRIL 19, ENTHUSIASTIC AND EMOTIONAL NEPALESE REACTION CONSTITUTED DRAMATIC EVIDENCE THAT THIS THEME INDEED IS TOUCHSTONE OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AS FAR AS NEPALESE ARE CONCERNED. TRUE, NEPALESE LEADERS, INCLUDING KING, SEE AMERICA AS IMPORTANT TO THEM AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF AID AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY, THEY WELCOME SIGNALS FROM US THAT INCREASED INDIAN PREDOMINANCE TN SOUTH ASIA DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WILL PERMIT INDIA ATTITUDES TO REGULATE OR DETERMINE THE NATURE OF US-NEPAL BILATERAL RELATIONS. NEPALESE LEADERS FIND SUCH A US POSTURE DEEPLY ENCOURAGING AND REASSURING IN THEIR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN NEPAL'S INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY, THOUGH THEY REALIZE THIS US STANCE CARRIES WITH IT NO SPECIFIC COMMITMENT TO LEND THEM POLITICAL SUPPORT VIS-À-VIS INDIA.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>CONCLUSIONS. VISIT DEMONSTRATED NOT ONLY HIGH VALUE GON ATTACHES TO US RELATIONSHIP BUT ALSO, IMPLICITLY, PROBLEMS AND CONTRADICTIONS US CONTINUES TO FACE IN ESTABLISHING A SUBCONTINENTAL POLICY THAT AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZES IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING SATISFACTORY RELATIONS WITH INDIA WHILE PURSUING OUR LEGITIMATE BILATERAL INTERESTS IN AND WITH INDIA'S SMALLER NEIGHBORS. (WHILE OUR SITUATION IN LANDLOCKED NEPAL IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE, WE SUSPECT THAT SIMILAR CONTRADICTIONS EXIST TO SOME DEGREE OR OTHER IN REGARD TO OUR RELATIONS WITH SUCH OTHER NEIGHBORS AS CEYLON, BANGLADESH, AND EVEN PAKISTAN.) AS TO HOW WE RECONCILE THESE CONFLICTING INTERESTS BETWEEN US-NEPALESE AND US-INDIAN RELATIONS IN NEPAL, POLICY CONSIDERATIONS SUGGESTED IN OUR 4457 OF NOVEMBER 20, 1972, APPEAR REMAIN GENERALLY VALID. A US POSTURE IN ANY SMALL STATE NEIGHBORING INDIA THAT IS <pb n="6" xml:id="d243-06" facs="d243-06"/>IN KEEPING WITH INTERNATIONAL NORMS, IS CLEAR IN ITS PURPOSE, OPENLY EXPLAINED, STEADY, AND PREDICTABLE, OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS WITH THE NEIGHBOR WITHOUT CAUSING UNDUE SUSPICION OR OPPOSITION IN INDIA — AS LONG AS DELHI CONTINUES TO FOLLOW POLICIES TOWARD ITS NEIGHBORS THAT ARE IN FACT AS WELL AS IN WORD, BASED ON RESPECT FOR THE NEIGHBOR'S INDEPENDENCE, AS THE INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ASSURED DEPSEC THEY WERE (TEHRAN 2749, PARA 19). UNFORTUNATELY, CURRENT EMANATIONS FROM INDIAN EMBASSY AND LOCAL INDIAN JOURNALISTS SUGGEST INDIANS HERE ARE INTERPRETING DEPSEC VISIT TO NEPAL AS ANTI-INDIAN IN INTENT. WE HOPE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS IS TRANSITORY SOUR GRAPES RATHER THAN BEGINNING OF NEW PHASE DURING WHICH INDIA INTERPRETS ITS INTERESTS IN PARANOID AND POSSESSIVE MANNER.</item>

                    <p>During the course of an afternoon, the Foreign Minister and I, occasionally joined by other two had a rambling discourse. The key points that emerged follow:</p>

                            <p>Nonaligned Conference</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister was very forthright and strong in his criticism of the nonaligned conference. He felt that the more radical and extreme elements had controlled the conference, overwhelming countries such as Nepal, who are inclined to a more moderate view. He commented that the atmosphere at the conference was “heady.” Sympathetic to the Israeli cause, the Minister thought that the Arab nations might have been encouraged to undertake their attack on Israel by this heady atmosphere. On the other hand, Nepal was trapped into accepting the views of the conference leadership and at best could abstain or give no vocal support to the resolutions it inherently opposed. It could not afford to stand up in opposition to the conference consensus, since the pressure of consensus was just too great to withstand.</p>

                            <p>Ambassador Kim and I spent a good deal of time arguing the merits of our position on the Korean resolution at the UNGA. The <pb n="2" xml:id="d244-02" facs="d244-02"/>Foreign Minister was inclined to be sympathetic to the problems faced by the Republic of Korea and recognized the validity of my argument that support for the Algerian resolution could only be destabilizing in Asia with potentially broader and dangerous implications for the region. Consistent with his position on the nonaligned conference, however, the Foreign Minister remained inclined to a position of abstention on both the Algerian resolution and the US-sponsored resolution.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, the argumentation presented him did strike sympathetic notes and he appeared prepared to give the problem some further study.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">SUMMARY</hi>: Looked at from Kathmandu, frictions between India and Nepal seem to be on the increase and may well further <pb n="2" xml:id="d245-02" facs="d245-02"/>intensify in 1974. Minor border raids from India by Nepali Congress dissidents and impact of shortages in India on Nepalese economy are principal sources of friction. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will want to avoid involvement in these disputes as long as regional stability not threatened and to maintain existing policies based on our bilateral interests in each country. END SUMMARY.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>In recent weeks there have been increasing storm signals in Indo/Nepalese relations. At various places along Indo/Nepalese border, minor but violent incidents have occurred in which so-called “antisocial” elements have been attacking police posts, looting grain stocks and, in most serious incident, attempting bomb principal bank at Biratnagar. It is widely accepted by Nepalese that “antisocial” elements are in fact Nepali Congress dissidents operating from Indian sanctuaries with aim of undermining regime of KING BIRENDRA. Given understanding which <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> received from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> during KING's State visit to Delhi that NCP dissidents would be kept at least fifty miles from border, Nepalese are concerned about Indian intentions. This concern is intensified by belief that Nepal has not received what it considers to be adequate satisfaction from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> authorities on 1972 Haripur incident and subsequent RNAC skyjacking.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>As Embassy Delhi rightly observes, GOI is sympathetic to “democratic forces” in Nepal. It probably cannot control all cross-border activities of NCP adherents, though <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> undoubtedly expects it to do so and interprets failure in this regard as <pb n="3" xml:id="d245-03" facs="d245-03"/>evidence of Indian pressure for political change. As we indicated <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">RefTel</gloss> B, we anticipate some increase in level of unrest in Nepal unless economic situation takes unexpected turn for better. In this situation violent incidents may increase, and India is likely to get the blame. The more that Indian politicians (and diplomats) talk about Indian affinity for democratic systems, the more this is read in Kathmandu as intent to support subversion from without. We do not anticipate that rising violence will have effect of pursuading KING to liberalize his regime as Indians might like, and repression seems more likely than compromise.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>If, in these circumstances, COI may be tempted to “unleash” NCP, effects on stability in Nepal could be serious. It is, of course, not in our interest that India meddle in Nepal's internal affairs, not only because of adverse impact on development prospects but also because of enhanced dangerof Sino-Indian confrontation in and over Nepal.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>On economic front Nepalese are chafing under terms of trade and transit agreement. They believe India is able to meet Nepalese economic demands which they perceive to be limited in scope. Nepalese do not understand that India cannot always meet requirements of extremely backward country of 12 million people. Petroleum and other shortages, which have already developed here or which are likely to develop, may well be seen by Nepalese as evidence of deliberate Indian policy rather than as inevitable result of worldwide situation.</item>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d245-04" facs="d245-04"/>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Unfortunately Indian aid, while generous in global terms, has not done much to increase long-run self-reliance of Nepal, which may, in fact, be economic chimaera. Infrastructure projects such as East-West highway or Kosi barrage are felt by Nepalese to be as much in India's strategic and economic interest as in Nepal's. <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss>'s skittishness about Karnali is in part reflection of Nepal's preoccupation that it not be taken for economic ride in any future agreements with India. Given virtual total dependence of Nepalese economy on India, <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> fears being dragged down by Indian economic failure, but is not yet mature enough to recognize it could be buoyed up by Indian success.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Question of economic relationship between India and Nepal is one which has dimension for US policy. During 1960's we endeavored to encourage economic and strategic complementarity between Nepal and India. In recent years, and particularly since 1971, we have tried to look at Nepal as entity worthy of attention in its own right. This does not mean, however, that the imperatives of economic interdependence between Nepal and India can or should be depreciated. On contrary, a constructive, amicable and mutually supportive interdependence between the two countries serves our basic interests in stability and economic development in the subcontinent. While recognizing the benefits of some diversification in Nepali trade, we do not believe it would be either possible or desirable to embark on policies designed to alter significantly the interdependence between Nepal and India.</item>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d245-05" facs="d245-05"/>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>As and if tensions rise in Nepal and economic and political frictions between Nepal and India increase, we will want in Nepal to maintain our current posture of steady and sympathetic support for Nepal's development objectives and political integrity. As long as regional stability not threatened, we would not propose to offer Nepal advice about its relations with India any more than we should offer India advice about its relations with Nepal. No doubt both sides will be free in their advice to us on how to handle our relations with the other, but this we can stand.</item>

                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> STILL IN PROCESS OF CARRYING OUT STUDIES TO DETERMINE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BAN ON GANJA CULTIVATION AND POSSIBLE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT BE ADOPTED TO OFFSET ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS RESULTING FROM BAN. PRELIMINARY SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED IN SIX DISTRICTS IN WESTERN NEPAL, AND SURVEY TEAM IS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE SHORTLY TO CARRY OUT SIMILAR STUDIES IN TERAI (REF B.).</p>
                    <p>2. STUDY OF SIX DISTRICTS IN WESTERN HILLS AREA INDICATES THAT IN ALL DISTRICTS, EXCEPT SALLYAN CULTIVATION OF HEMP RANKS SECOND AS SOURCE OF INCOME. HEMP WAS NOT AS IMPORTANT IN LOW LYING AREAS WHERE IT WAS RELATIVELY EASIER TO GROW OTHER CROPS, BUT IN AREAS OF HIGHER ELEVATION HEMP WAS FOUND TO BE MAJOR CROP. HEMP WAS FOUND IN BOTH WILD AND CULTIVATED STATE. WHERE CULTIVATED, ONE SEEDING WAS SUFFICIENT FOR FIVE TO SIX YEARS OF CROPS. IN ADDITION TO PRODUCTION OF HASHISH FROM HEMP PLANT, FARMERS USED PLANTS TO MAKE SACKS, CLOTHES, ROPES, ROOFING, AND EDIBLE OILS. REPORT INDICATES THAT NO FARMERS WERE COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON CULTIVATION OF HEMP, BUT THAT MANY MADE LIVING FROM THREE TO FOUR MONTHS OF YEAR FROM HEMP. LOSS OF INCOME RESULTING FROM BAN ON CULTIVATION WAS ESTIMATED AT 25 PERCENT TO 35 PERCENT.</p>
                    <p>3. LOSS OF INCOME FROM HEMP PRODUCTION WAS SEEN AS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS PROBLEM SINCE WESTERN HILLS DISTRICTS UNDER BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES ARE AMONG POOREST IN NEPAL. FARMERS DEPENDED ON CASH INCOME FROM HEMP TO BUY SALT, SOME FOOD SUPPLIES, AND TO PAY LAND TAXES. MOREOVER, HASHISH DEALERS ALSO SERVED AS LOCAL MONEYLENDERS, PROVIDING ADVANCES AND LOANS, A SERVICE NOW MISSING SINCE CULTIVATION AND COMMERCE IN HASHISH WAS PROHIBITED.</p>
                    <p>4. GIVEN DISPERSION OF SETTLEMENTS, REPORT CONCLUDES THAT ASSISTANCE CAN ONLY BE HANDLED THROUGH WIDE VARIETY OF SMALL PROGRAMS. AS MOST OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY BAN IN WESTERN PART OF NEPAL LIVE AT HIGHER ALTITUDES, FOODGRAINS COULD NOT SERVE AS SUBSTITUTE CROP. REPORT THEREFORE RECOMMENDS ENCOURAGEMENT OF SHEEP FARMING, HORTICULTURE, AND CULTIVATION OF POTATOES. OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF INCOME INCLUDE CULTIVATION OF HERBS; ESTABLISHMENT OF COTTAGE INDUSTRIES SUCH AS BASKETS, BLANKETS AND RUGS; PAPER PRODUCTION FROM LOCAL PLANTS AND GRASSES; AND LIVESTOCK FARMING. CONSTRUCTION OF SMALL PUBLIC WORKS SUCH AS IRRIGATION CANALS, BRIDGES, AND ROADS WAS PROPOSED AS AN IMMEDIATE SOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME FOR PEOPLE IN AREAS PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY BAN.</p>
                    <p>5. REPORT CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT HASHISH IS HARMFUL FOR GENERAL USE AND THAT BAN ON ITS CULTIVATION WAS TIMELY STEP. BAN HAS HOWEVER CREATED TWO PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS IN THAT SUPPLIES OF HASHISH ARE REQUIRED FOR USE AS MEDICINE AND PEOPLE IN SOME AREAS OF COUNTRY ARE DEPRIVED OF MAJOR SOURCE OF INCOME. AS SUGGESTED COURSE OF ACTION, REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE FOR COLLECTION OF HASHISH IN LIMITED AND NECESSARY QUANTITIES; THAT CULTIVATION OF HEMP SHOULD BE PERMITTED FOR END-USES SUCH AS CLOTH, ROPES, FUEL WOOD, AND EDIBLE OILS; AND THAT ALTERNATIVE OCCUPATIONS MUST BE FOUND FOR PEOPLE AFFECTED BY BAN.</p>
                    <p>6. EMBASSY'S JUDGMENT IS THAT CHANCES FOR PASSAGE OF NARCOTICS LEGISLATION IN SUMMER SESSION OF PANCHAYAT ARE NOW UNCERTAIN. GON HAS NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO ASSESS REAL IMPACT OF BAN AND SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND POLITICIANS ARE KNOWN TO BE UNWILLING TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON NARCOTICS LEGISLATION UNTIL SOME MEANS FOUND TO OFFSET ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS. MOREOVER, THERE IS OPPOSITION TO LEGISLATION FROM LANDOWNERS PARTICULARLY IN TERAI SOME OF WHOM ARE MEMBERS OF NATIONAL PANCHAYAT, WHO HAVE FOUND GANJA CULTIVATION TO BE LUCRATIVE. EMBASSY IS CONTINUING TO DO ALL POSSIBLE TO ENHANCE POSSIBILITY OF FAVORABLE ACTION OF LEGISLATION IN SUMMER SESSION OF PANCHAYAT.</p>
                    <p>7. PLEASE TELL DITTERT THAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WE THINK BEST TACTIC FOR SIR HARRY TO FOLLOW IN HIS STATEMENT IS TO HOLD GON FEET TO THE FIRE BY SPEAKING IN EXPECTATION OF EARLY PASSAGE OF BASIC DRUG LEGISLATION. THUS SIR HARRY COULD REFER WITH APPRECIATION TO EARLIER STATEMENTS OF GON OFFICIALS AFFIRMING GON INTENTION TO ADOPT BASIC NARCOTICS LEGISLATION AND SAY THAT HE LOOKS FORWARD TO ENACTMENT OF A BASIC NARCOTICS LAW AT THE JULY SESSION OF THE NATIONAL PANCHAYAT AND THAT THIS WILL LAY ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR AN EFFECTIVE DRUG CONTROL SYSTEM IN NEPAL. EVEN THOUGH PROSPECTS FOR ADOPTION OF BASIC DRUG LAW IN JULY ARE UNCERTAIN AS NOTED ABOVE, WE BELIEVE U.S. AND UN REPS SHOULD FOLLOW TACTIC WHICH FORCES GON TO RECOGNIZE THAT POSITIVE ACTION ON ITS PART IN DRUG FIELD IS ANTICIPATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.</p>

                    <p>1. INDIAN WIRE SERVICES REPORT FROM GANGTOK THAT THE SIKKIM ASSEMBLY ADOPTED JUNE 20 A 34-CLAUSE QUOTE GOVERNMENT OF SIKKIM BILL END QUOTE. THIS NEW QUOTE CONSTITUTION END QUOTE WAS PREPARED BY AN EMINENT INDIAN JURIST, G.R. RAJAGOPAUL, AT THE QUOTE REQUEST END QUOTE OF THE CHOGYAL AND THE SIKKIMESE ASSEMBLE.</p>
                    <p>2. THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTION REPORTED IN THE PRESS ARE PROVISION FOR A FOUR-YEAR ASSEMBLY WHICH CAN DISCUSS AND PASS BILLS ON INTERNAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MATTERS. THE INDIAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS TO BE THE PRESIDENT AND SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. HE WILL ALSO ADVISE ON THE APPOINTMENT OF A CHIEF MINISTER AND MINISTERS (THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL) WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE ASSEMBLY. THE CHOGYAL'S TITULAR POWERS ARE ALSO SPELLED OUT IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION WHICH GRANTS HIM THE RIGHT TO DELAY THE ADOPTION OF BILLS BY WITHHOLDING ASSENT, BUT ENABLES THE ASSEMBLY TO PASS BILLS OVER HIS QUOTE VETO END QUOTE BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY. (COPY POUCHED TO <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>/INS).</p>
                    <p>3. THE WIRE SERVICES SAY THE ASSEMBLY ENDORSED THE CONSTITUTION QUOTE AMIDST MOUNTING TENSION END QUOTE CAUSED BY EFFORTS OF THE CHOGYAL AND HIS SUPPORTERS TO BLOCK PASSAGE OF BILL. THERE WAS A FRACAS OUTSIDE THE ASSEMBLY BUILDING AND THE CENTRAL RESERVE POLICE WERE CALLED OUT. THE CHOGYAL HAD AGREED DURING A RECENT VISIT TO DELHI TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION BUT HAD GOVE BACK ON THIS ASSURANCE.</p>
                    <p>4. COMMENT: SO FAR, WE HAVE ONLY THE INDIAN HANDOUT VERSION OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN GANGTOK. IT IS CLEAR TO US, HOWEVER,THAT THE CHOGYAL DID NOT WANT THIS CONSTITUTION AND THAT HE DELAYED AND RESISTED ITS ADOPTION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THE NEW DOCUMENT BASICALLY REAFFIRMS AND ELABORATES THE POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND COUNCIL AND THE INDIAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE PROVIDED FOR IN THE MAY 8, 1973, AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOI, THE CHOGYAL, AND THE SIKKIMESE POLITICAL PARTIES (<gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>). IT IS THUS AN ENDORSEMENT BY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES IN SIKKIM OF THE EXTREMELY LIMITED, TITULAR ROLE OF THE CHOGYAL AND OF THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT'S EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY WITH REGARD TO INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION. INDIA'S EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SIKKIM'S DEFENSE, COMMUNICATIONS AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARE SET FORTH IN THE 1950 TREATY.</p>
                    <p>5. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW THE CHOGYAL WILL ACCOMMODATE HIMSELF TO HIS NOW PERMANENT POSITION OF VIRTUAL IMPOTENCE (WHICH RADICALS WITHIN THE SIKKIM ASSEMBLY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY TRY TO INTENSIFY AND EMPHASIZE IN THE FUTURE). HIS OPTIONS ARE FEW: TO ABDICATE, TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND SPEND MOST OF HIS TIME ELSEWHERE WHILE NOT FORMALLY ABDICATING, TO PLAY OUT HIS ROLE OF QUOTE CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCH END QUOTE IN GOOD FAITH, OR TO ATTEMPT TO ORGANIZE CLANDESTINE OPPOSITION FROM AMONG LOYAL MEMBERS OF THE LEPCHA OR BHUTIA COMMUNITY. AT THIS POINT, PROSPECTS FOR THE LONG-TERM SURVIVAL OF THE ROYAL HOUSE DO NOT LOOK GOOD.</p>

                        <item>SUMMARY. Non-alignment and association with Non-Aligned Conference Group (NACG) are fundamental elements of Nepal's foreign policy. As moderate and pragmatic member of NACG, Nepal uses its limited influence in direction of more balanced positions. GON is receptive to US views on many issues, particularly desirability of mitigating extremist tendencies in NACG. To the degree we can persuade <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> that these extremists are creating undesirable precedents or operation effective operation of multilateral institutions, we may be able to influence it to <pb n="2" xml:id="d249-02" facs="d249-02"/>dissociate itself from particularly radical NACG positions, but Nepal will not wish to be isolated from mainstream of non-aligned thinking. In addition, on most issues where its two giant neighbors China and India are in agreement, Nepal considers its freedom of maneuver limited and will be cautious in taking which would antagonize either neighbor. END SUMMARY.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Although one of the more moderate and pragmatic of NACC members, Nepal has increasingly acceded publicly and in multilateral fora to extremist NACG positions and tactics. <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> has also acquiesced in consensus approach to NAGG decision-making and has expressed concern with extremist views only privately or as unacknowledged reservations within NACG meetings. Nepal is ambivalent in its attitudes towards NACG, which in name, if not substance, epitomizes Nepal's traditional and entrenched non-aligned foreign policy. It would feel isolated and somehow less non-aligned if it were not NACG participant. Through NACG association, where it is member of recently constituted Coordinating Bureau and four nation LDC team to negotiate on oil prices with Arabs, Nepal has gained international publicity, foreign and domestic prestige and close association with at least some like-minded states. At the same time, <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> leadership is uneasy about extremist tactics as employed in NACG and some of the results produced, to the extent that it has apparently even considered pulling out (<gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">RefTel</gloss> C).</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>We do not consider it likely that <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> will, in fact, pull out of NACG. Indeed, presence of relatively moderate Nepal in NACG is <pb n="3" xml:id="d249-03" facs="d249-03"/>in our interests. The problem we face is one of how to reinforce moderate tendencies in <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> policy in face of cohesive tactics of more radical third world countries and Nepal's concern for sensitivities of its two giant neighbors—China and India. In the past, with the exception of Middle East issues, Nepal has been reluctant to take positions greatly at variance with those of her neighbors, or with non-aligned consensus, and we should not have unrealistic expectations of independent action by small, isolated, insecure state such as Nepal when third world issues are at stake.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>We concur that steps outlined para four <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">RefTel</gloss> A are very much in order. From Kathmandu perspective we suggest major us effort to help the moderates of the NACG to identify issues where they have interests in common in the hope that a moderate group might eventually coalesce to challenge extremist control in NACG. In our tactics in dealing with the moderates we should make clear that we do not find non-alignment objectionable per se but that this is a lapse in congruity in applying the appellation of “nonaligned” to a grouping which is demonstrably led by committed extremists. In addition we should bear down hard with moderate members of NACG wherever we can convincingly demonstrate that precedents being created by NACG “strong-arm tactics” are harmful to specific third party interests. (For example, many countries, including Nepal, face serious threats from exile claimants to power; like Nepal Congress Party dissidents in India; and hence support for GRUNK or PRG is adverse to their interests.) <pb n="4" xml:id="d249-04" facs="d249-04"/>In addition we must prepare for horse-trading at international conferences with groupings within the NACG. On basis of our recent discussions with <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_LOS1">LOS</gloss>, it appears that landlocked states like Nepal may be willing to go along with some points Of strategic and economic importance to US if they receive in return support on issues of key interest to landlocked countries. (<gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">RefTel</gloss> KATHMANDU 2225).</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>We are lees certain about proposed trade-off between economic assistance and political support. It may be desirable as suggested paras 4c &amp; e to adjust our positions on resource transfer to developing nations and to demonstrate greater flexibility in this area. Unfortunately, most third world countries believe that accelerated resource transfer through international organizations is already their due, and they are unlikely to make compensating political gestures in return. Attempts to bring about changes in also political posture on specific issue by withholding aid is also unlikely to be productive in it increasingly nationalistic country such as Nepal. Indeed, direct <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> pressure of this kind is more likely to antagonize <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> than to induce greater flexibility on its part. Instead we would strongly recommend wherever possible that we seek to mobilize other small Asian states behind particular issues of importance to us. Nepal an more easily be influenced by its neighbors and by other states in similar geopolitical situations than it can by external great powers.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>In sum, problem of radicalization of non-aligned countries is <pb n="5" xml:id="d249-05" facs="d249-05"/>one which we can influence somewhat, but within limits. The sense of solidarity among third world countries is growing. Nepal feeling insecure in its geopolitical situation, is unlikely to put much distance between itself and the non-aligned consensus unless it can be convinced that divergent position is clearly in its national interest.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. SUMMARY: <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN EFFORT TO DISARM KHAMPAS RESIDENT IN MUSTANG AND IS TAKING MILITARY ACTION TO THIS END. SITUATION HAS CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR ESCALATION AND WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY ATTRACT INCREASING INTERNATIONAL PRESS PLAY. EMBASSY BELIEVES USG SHOULD BE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT USG INVOLVEMENT WITH KHAMPAS. END SUMMARY.</p>
                    <p>2. IN LAST WEEK TO TEN DAYS WE HAVE DEVELOPED INFORMATION WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN SUBJECT OF EXTENSIVE RUMOR MONGERING ON GON ACTIONS AND INTENTIONS IN RESPECT TO ARMED TIBETAN KHAMPA REFUGEES IN MUSTANG. OUR REPORTING SOURCES INDICATE <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> MILITARY ACTIVITY TO BE EITHER CONTEMPLATED OR UNDERWAY TO COMPEL KHAMPA SURRENDER OF ARMS, ISSUANCE OF IDENTITY CARDS, AND DISPERSAL TO OTHER LESS SENSITIVE AREAS OF THE KINGDOM.</p>
                    <p>3. INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US INDICATES THAT ARREST OF A TIBETAN, LHAMO TSERING, IN POKHARA ON APRIL 19 WAS A <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> EFFORT, BY HOLDING HIM HOSTAGE, TO COMPEL KHAMPA ADHERANCE TO GON DEMANDS. ARREST BOTH MISCALCULATED TSERING'S INFLUENCE AND THE ANTICIPATED KHAMPA RESPONSE. <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> APPARENTLY PLANNED OR ALREADY HAS UNDERWAY MILITARY EFFORTS FORCEABLY TO DISARM THE KHAMPAS. WE HAVE RECEIVED VARIIOUS AND FRAGMENTARY REPORTS OF KHAMPAS MOVING TOWARDS POKHARA TO EFFECT THE RELEASE OF TSERING, <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> MILITARY UNITS MOVING IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS TOWARDS MUSTANG TO FORCEABLY DIVEST THE KHAMPAS OF THEIR ARMS, AND FIRE-FIGHTS INVOLVING NON-SPECIFIC CASUALTY FIGURES SUFFERED BY BOTH PROTAGANISTS. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE RUMORS THAT RAJA OF MUSTANG IS SUPPORTING KHAMPAS AND THAT CHINESE HAVE MOVED TROOPS TOWARDS MUSTANG.</p>
                    <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> IS TRYING TO DOWNPLAY SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS. THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS ON JUNE 29 ADVISED THE NATIONAL PANCHAYAT THAT GON EFFORTS IN MUSTANG WERE LIMITED TO REGISTERING AND REHABILITATING THE KHAMPAS, AND THE SEMI-OFFICIALRISING NEPAL ON JULY 4 QUOTED AN MFA SPOKESMAN AS TERMING QUOTE MALICIOUS AND MISLEADING END QUOTE AN INDIAN PRESS REPORT CLAIMING MUSTANG TO BE A SEMI-AUTONOMOUS REGION.</p>
                    <p>5. OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT BASED ON REPORTING AVAILABLE TO THIS DATE, IS THAT GON ACTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH CONTROL OVER A HITHERTO UNRULY AND AUTONOMOUS ELEMENT OF THE POPULATION, TO DEFUSE AN ISSUE OF PERIODIC DISPUTE IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE PRC AND TO PREEMPT THE NEPAL CONGRESS PARTY FROM OBTAINING KHAMPA ARMS FOR POLITICAL ENDS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, SERIOUS RISK GON WILL MISCALCULATE THE KHAMPA RESPONSE, AND THIS IN TURN HOLDS POTENTIAL FOR AN EMBARRASSING ARMED CONFLICT IN WHICH THE ROYAL NEPALESE ARMY MIGHT SUFFER CASUALITIES AND IN WHICH EXTENDED GUERRILLA ACTION MIGHT ENSUE. THE OLD ISSUE OF [text not declassified] INVOLVEMENT WITH THE KHAMPA FORCE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SURFACE AS IS EVIDENT FROM HINDUSTAN TIMES JULY 3 ARTICLE MAKING REFERENCE TO WESTERN REPORTS OF CIA ARMING OF KHAMPAS.</p>
                    <p>6. THOUGH ALL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US INDICATES GON OBJECTIVES ARE LIMITED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT WOULD BE PRUDENT FOR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO PREPARE FOR THE CONTINGENCY THAT HOSTILITIES ESCALATE RESULTING IN CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS, CONTINUED PRESS SPECULATION AND RUMORS AND ALLEGATIONS OF CURRENT USG INVOLVEMENT. WE NEED TO HAVE PREPARED A UNIFIED, EFFECTIVE AND CREDIBLE RESPONSE.</p>
                    <p>7. UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THE MISSION IS EXPRESSING NO PARTICULAR INTEREST IN EVENTS IN MUSTANG TO EITHER OFFICIALS OF THE <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss>, MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY OR OTHERS WITH WHOM WE ARE IN CONTACT. WE UNDERSTAND FROM INDIAN AMBASSADOR HERE THAT HE IS TAKING SIMILAR LOW-KEY POSTURE. BY LISTENING BUT NOT PROBING WE HOPE TO AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING A SPECIAL INTEREST IN A MATTER THAT MIGHT AMPLY INVOLVEMENT OR UNDUE CONCERN. SHOULD THE SITUATION DEVELOP TO THE POINT THAT RESPONSE IS REQUIRED TO ACCUSATIONS OF USG INVOLVEMENT WITH KHAMPAS IN NEPAL. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD STATE THAT THIS MISSION IS NOT, NOR HAS IT EVER IN THE PAST, BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE KHAMPAS OF MUSTANG. PRIVATELY, IF PRESSED FOR COMMENT BY GON OFFICIALS, I BELIEVE WE CAN FURTHER DEFUSE THE ISSUE OF THIS MISSION'S ROLE BY STATEMENTS OF SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT FOR GON EFFORTS TO EFFECT LEGITIMATE CONTROL OVER A POTENTIALLY TROUBLESOME ELEMENT OF THE REFUGEE POPULATION. IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS OF FORMER <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> INVOLVEMENT WITH THE KHAMPAS, THIS MISSION SHOULD DECLINE ANY COMMENT. IF COMMENT SHOULD BE NEEDED, WE SUGGEST THIS BE MADE BY APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN. IN DEVELOPING DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE, WE SHOULD CONSIDER MAKING THE POINT TO THE EXTENT THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HAS EVER BEEN IN A POSITION TO INFLUENCE THE TIBETAN LEADERSHIP, OUR LONGTIME ADVICE AND EFFORTS HAVE BEEN TO ASSIST ENSURE THAT TIBETAN REFUGEES HONOR THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE LAWS OF HOST GOVERNMENTS IN WHOSE COUNTRIES THEY ARE GENEROUSLY AFFORDED REFUGE AND THAT THEY ENGAGE ONLY IN PEACEFUL AND NON-MILITARY OCCUPATIONS.</p>
                    <p>8. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE SITUATION CURRENTLY REQUIRES ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT. I DO, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THAT SITUATION IS POTENTIALLY ONE WHICH COULD DRAG ON AND ATTRACT INCREASING PRESS PLAY. WE SHOULD BE ALERT TO THOSE CONTINGENCIES, AND I URGE THE DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW THE PROBLEM [text not declassified] AND TO PREPARE CONTINGENCY GUIDANCE FOR USE IN WASHINGTON AND BY THIS AND OTHER INVOLVED MISSIONS.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Merger of Sikkim with India</p>
                    <p>On September 5 the Indian Parliament passed a Constitutional amendment incorporating Sikkim as an “associate state.” Sikkim's new status represents a distinctly more organic relationship within India than was implied by its status as a protectorate under the 1950 India-Sikkim Treaty. It is not clear the extent to which Sikkim retains its right to “autonomy in regard to its internal affairs” specified in the 1950 treaty. Also uncertain is whether the Chogyal (ruling prince) of Sikkim will agree to maintain his office which in the past has represented the special identity of the Sikkimese state. Indian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName> has stated in Parliament that the new relationship can continue with or without the office of Chogyal and has indicated that the new arrangement is irreversible.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">Foreign Implications</p>
                    <p>Peking has reacted strongly to what a September 3 <hi rend="underline">People's Daily</hi> article calls the “annexation of Sikkim.” The commentator article denounced the Indian “expansionist act” of a “sub-superpower,” charged Soviet encouragement and support and, in a departure from recent practice, attacked <persName corresp="#p_GI2">Indira Gandhi</persName> personally. Nepalese Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KGB1">Karki</persName> said in the national legislature that “as a close neighbor, Nepal wishes that Sikkim should continue to make progress through the preservation of its traditional entity.” In addition, the Government permitted (and probably engineered) large student demonstrations against India in Kathmandu. Indian officials have expressed surprise and unhappiness over the Nepalese reaction.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d253-02" facs="d253-02"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">Legal Situation</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The legal situation is cloudy, an observation buttressed by the Indian Foreign Minister's statement that the new association is “a political matter and not a question of legal niceties.” Internationally recognized attributes of sovereignty including control over defense, foreign affairs and internal communications have been exercised by India under the 1950 Treaty. A brief campaign in 1972-73 by the Chogyal for greater independence was aborted by communal riots in April, 1973. India intervened to supervise elections and the drafting of a “Constitution” (The Government of Sikkim Bill, 1974) which the Chogyal reluctantly signed in July. The BILL makes the Indian Government the final arbiter of disputes between the Chief Executive (appointed by India) and the Sikkim Assembly. The Chogyal retains only titular power.</p>
                    <p>India explains Sikkim's new status as a response to the Sikkim Assembly's request for participation in the Indian Parliament. It appears that India will defend the new status on the grounds that Sikkim was not sovereign, and that the new association represents Sikkimese desire for greater participation in the political life of India.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">Questions Raised</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Critics will argue that India engineered the series of events, including the drafting of the 1974 Sikkim Bill, which have led to Sikkim's absorption into the Indian Union, and that the merger does not represent the wishes of the Sikkimese people. Legal questions are also raised by <persName corresp="#p_SSS1">SWARAN SINGH</persName>'s indication that there could be no unilateral decision by Sikkim to revoke associate status. Critics can argue that India's action violates the right of self-determination.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">Indian Motives</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Embassy Delhi and we are puzzled why the Indians decided to expose themselves to certain international criticism <pb n="3" xml:id="d253-03" facs="d253-03"/>when it already had effective control over Sikkim. Possibly India's confrontation with the Chogyal last year and his continued effort to assert his independent authority prompted India to undertake a “permanent” solution at this time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">U.S. Interests</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Indian absorption of Sikkim does not directly involve the U.S. We have never questioned India's protecting authority over Sikkim and its new status raises no question of direct American legal obligation to an existing sovereign state. Nevertheless, there is public interest in Sikkim because the Chogyal married socialite Hope Cooke. She is now separated from the Chogyal and living in New York. So far she has made no statement on events, although she was previously outspoken for greater Sikkimese autonomy. We have not been queried by the press about Sikkim. If we are, we plan to take a “no comment” line.</p>

                    <p>SUMMARY: CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SEPTEMBER 11 ISSUED A STRONG CONDEMNATION OF INDIA'S QUOTE ANNEXATION END QUOTE OF SIKKIM. THE STATEMENT REPRESENTS THE FIRST OFFICIAL PRONOUNCEMENT OF CHINA'S POSITION ON SIKKIM AND ON THE MOST RECENT INDIAN ACTION. IT INDICATES PEKING'S VIEW OF NEW DELHI AS A WILLING AND KEY ADJUNCT IN THE FURTHERANCE OF MOSCOW'S HEGEMONIC DESIGNS ON THE AREA AND UNDERSCORES PEKING'S APPARENT AND HEIGHTENED CONCERN OVER ITS PRECEPTION OF STEPPED-UP SOVIET TROUBLE-MAKING IN SOUTH ASIA. THE STATEMENT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT GO BEYOND STRONG VERBAL SUPPORT OF THE SIKKIMESE PEOPLE, REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE THE QUOTE ANNEXATION, END QUOTE AND A WARNING THAT SUCH ACTION WILL QUOTE COME TO NO GOOD END. END QUOTE IN VIEW OF CHINA'S CURRENT INTEREST IN COUNTERING WHAT THE PRC PERCEIVES AS SOVIET ENCROACHMENT INTO THE REGION, PEKING WILL PROBABLY INTENSIFY HER EFFORTS TO IMPROVE TIES WITH OTHER SOUTH ASIAN NATIONS, WHICH PROBABLY ALSO VIEW THE INDIAN ACTION WITH SOME ALARM. END SUMMARY.</p>
                    <p>1. PRC FOREIGN MINISTRY SEPTEMBER 11 ISSUED A STRONGLY- WORDED STATEMENT CONDEMNING INDIA'S QUOTE ANNEXATION END QUOTE OF SIKKIM. THE OFFICIAL BLAST AT INDIA FOLLOWS A SPATE OF PRC MEDIA REPORTS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS (WR 36 AND 37) CRITICAL OF NEW DELHI'S MOVES TO MAKE SIKKIM AN ASSOCIATE STATE.</p>
                    <p>2. ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, THE FIRST PUBLICLY-RELEASED AND OFFICIAL PRONOUNCEMENT OF THE PRC POSITION, QUOTE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SOLEMNLY STATES THAT IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE INDIA'S ILLEGAL ANNEXATION OF SIKKIM AND THAT IT FIRMLY SUPPORTS THE PEOPLE OF SIKKIM IN THEIR JUST STRUGGLE FOR NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY.END QUOTE.</p>
                    <p>3. RAISING THE FAMOUS QUOTE BULLY END QUOTE THEME, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY CHARGES THAT THE QUOTE FLAGRANT END QUOTE INDIAN ACTION WAS CARRIED OUT IN DISREGARD OF THE WISHES OF THE CHOGYAL AND THE SIKKIMESE PEOPLE, A THEME AMPLIFIED IN RECENT PRC MEDIA REPORTS. ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT, QUOTE HAVING INHERITED THE MANTLE OF IMPERIALISM, END QUOTE INDIA HAS QUOTE ALWAYS PURSUED A COLONIALIST POLICY TOWARD SIKKIM. END QUOTE. HOWEVER, CHINA CONTENDS THAT INDIA SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN EMBOLDENED BY HER RECENT FIRST NUCLEAR TEST AND QUOTE THOUGHT IT COULD DO WHATEVER IT PLEASED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS. END QUOTE.</p>
                    <p>4. THE OFFICIAL PRC STATEMENT, HOWEVER, CLEARLY REVEALS AND UNDERSCORES PEKING'S HEIGHTENED APPREHENSION ABOUT WHAT THE PRC PERCEIVES AS STEPPED-UP SOVIET TROUBLE-MAKING IN THE AREA AND STRONGER INDO-SOVIET TIES. THE TEXT EXPLICITLY POINTS TO MOSCOW'S LONE SUPPORT FOR INDIA'S QUOTE SHAMELESS ACT END QUOTE AND FOR QUOTE <persName corresp="#p_GI2">INDIRA GANDHI</persName>'S GOVERNMENT END QUOTE AS UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE THAT SOVIET REVISIONIST SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM IS QUOTE THE BOSS BEHIND THE SCENE AS WELL AS THE ABETTOR OF INDIAN EXPANSIONISM. END QUOTE. (PRC MEDIA COMMENTS HAVE TERMED THE SOVIETS AS THE QUOTE FEROCIOUS ENEMY END QUOTE OF THE SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES.) AN NCNA REPORT OF SEPTEMBER 11 REPLAYED STATEMENTS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES WHICH ASSERTED THAT INDIRA GANDHI'S FORTHCOMING VISIT TO MOSCOW IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN INDO-SOVIET LINKS IS QUOTE NOT A GOOD OMEN END QUOTE AND PROBABLY A PRELUDE TO FURTHER TROUBLES FOR THE REGION.(WE NOTE THAT THE INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER IS CURRENTLY IN MOSCOW FOR TALKS WITH BREZHNEV.) WITH INDIA'S RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW APPARENTLY IN GOOD ORDER, PEKING HAS GIVEN CLEAR NOTICE THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVED SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS WHICH HAD WARMED SLIGHTLY LAST SPRING HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.</p>
                    <p>5. ALTHOUGH THE STATEMENT WARNS THAT QUOTE EXPANSIONISM WILL COME TO NO GOOD END, IT PROVIDES NO EXPLICIT THREAT AND IMPLIES THAT THE INDIAN ACTION WILL BE COUNTERED MAINLY BY SIKKIMESE OPPOSITION TO INDIA AS WELL AS HOPEFULLY ADVERSE WORLD OPINION AGAINST BOTH DELHI AND MOSCOW.</p>
                    <p>6. THE STRONG PRC STATEMENT IS AT LEAST PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LONG-TERM CHINESE SENSITIVITIES TOWARD INDIAN ACTIVITIES IN HIMALAYAN BORDER STATES, CONCERNS THAT ARE HEIGHTENED BY CHINA'S DESIRE TO COUNTER SOVIET INFLUENCE, INCLUDING CLOSER INDO-SOVIET TIES, THROUGHOUT SOUTH ASIA. WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT PRC WILL PROBABLY SEEK TO PLAY ON FEARS OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE AREA TO STRENGTHEN ITS OWN BILATERAL TIES WITH COUNTRIES ON INDIA'S PERIPHERY.</p>

                    <p>[name not declassified] dropped in for a briefing on the Secretary's visit to India. The conversation also covered the following themes with respect to Bhutan's relations with India and Chinese overtures to Bhutan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">Indian Advisors in Bhutan</hi>: [name not declassified] stated that Bhutan, as a general rule of the thumb, is terminating the contracts of all Indian advisors in Bhutan. Three months ago, the senior Indian police advisor was tossed out because of questionable actvities. Bhutan would like to rely on its own advisors across the board, look to the UNDP (which he said is already operating about twenty projects in Bhutan), or do without. By the end of the year, Bhutanese will be operating all of the telephone exchanges in the country. [name not declassified] claimed that Indian advisors often refused to accept instructions from their Bhutanese superiors. For example, the Indian Director of the large hydroelectric project in south-western Bhutan has refused to take orders from the Secretary dealing with the project from Thimphu.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="d255-02" facs="d255-02"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">Troubles over the Telecommunications Project</hi>: [name not declassified] said that several years ago the Bhutanese were completing negotiations with the UNDP to establish a telcommunication link with Bhutan's capital when the Indian Government intervened with an offer to do the project itself and to contribute the funds as well. The Bhutanese agreed. The Indians then sunk into inactivity for a year. When the Bhutanese alerted the Indians that they were still interested in the project, the Indians submitted a draft contract. The contract included a brief stipulation that a point of control for all cables dispatched from either direction would be located in India. The Bhutanese refused to sign. [name not declassified] thought that the Indians will shortly resubmit the contract minus the stipulation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">Indian Settlers</hi>: [name not declassified] stated that the Bhutanese Government was attempting to block the entry of the Indian settlers into Bhutan and, as unobtrusively as possible, move those who have already settled in Bhutan out of the country. Resources to do the job are limited and progress will probably continue at a snail's pace for some time to come. And the Bhutanese Government is very sensitive about India's feelings on this score. But the policy is clear.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">The Tibetan Refugee Community in Bhutan</hi>: According to [name not declassified], about 4,000 to 6,000 Tibetan refugees poured into Bhutan in 1959. Nehru asked the Bhutanese to allow them to stay until India completed facilities to receive them. NEHRU died and so did his personal commitment. The Indian Government has since refused to take them. [name not declassified] criticized the Tibetans for blatantly proclaiming their allegiance to the Dalai Lama, who is outside of Bhutan., while enjoyiug the prosperity and pleasures that life in Bhutan has brought. He also alluded to a conspiratorial connection between the Tibetans and the Indian Government. He remarked that the Khampa guerillas were trained in India, and alluded to a group of Khampas who had successfully left Nepal and were favorably received by the Indian army in Sikkim. He recounted that at a dinner party in Thimphu, a Bhutanese asked a high-ranking Indian official point blank why his Governmentwas supporting a Tibetan conspiracy against Bhutan. The Indian, [name not declassified] commented, did not respond.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="underline">China</hi>: Asked what was new in this area, [name not declassified] commented that the Chinese continue to buttonhole Bhutanese diplomats abroad about establishing diplomatic relations or accepting Chinese aid. The Bhutanese response is that the lack of official funds prevents the opening of new missions abroad. In what appeared to be a pre-prepared answer, he added that at this point Bhutan has about as much interest in China as it does in France.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. SUMMARY. NEPAL'S LAST MINUTE DECISION TO INSTRUCT ITS <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> DELEGATION TO ABSTAIN ACROSS THE BOARD ON THE KOREAN UN ISSUE AND SUBSEQUENT COMMENTS FROM SENIOR NEPALESE OFFICIALS ON THE KHMER AND KOREAN QUESTIONS INDICATE THAT NEPALESE HAVE ABSORBED SERIOUSNESS OF THESE QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE IMPACT OF SHARPLY DIVERGENT POSITIONS ON US-NEPALESE RELATIONS. NEPALESE OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN PLEASED AT THEIR ABILITY TO MODIFY THEIR KOREAN POSITION IN OUR DIRECTION RAPIDLY AND WITH TIMELY IMPACT AND HAVE EXPRESSED GRATIFICATION AS THE VOTING OUTCOME ON KOREA IN THE POLITICAL COMMITTEE. CHIRAN THAPA HAS EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT US AND GON CAN REVIEW THE CAMBODIA QUESTION AT A HIGHLEVEL DURING THE FEBRUARY CORONATION. END SUMMARY</p>
                    <p>2. MY APPROACH TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER ON THE KOREAN QUESTION ON DECEMBER 8 (KATHMANDU 5027) WAS DESIGNED TO CONVEY STRONGLY TO HIM US CONCERN AT THE PROSPECT OF A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT OF BASIC POLICY BY THE <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss>, EVIDENCED BY THEIR SUPPORT FOR SIHANOUK IN THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> AND THEIR INTENDED SUPPORT FOR THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION ON KOREA. I TOLD THE FOREIGN MINISTER THAT NEPAL'S VOTING ON THE KOREAN QUESTION WOULD BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE NEPALESE VOTES ON THE KHMER ISSUE. I SAID THE FACT THAT NEPAL HAD BEEN SOLIDLY AGAINST US - ON AN IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN UP AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS - HAD CAUSED EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT AND CONCERN HERE AND IN WASHINGTON. THE FULL VOTING TALLY ON CAMBODIA HAD ACCENTUATED THIS CONCERN, SINCE INDIA, BANGLADESH AND BURMA HAD ABSTAINED ON THE SUBSTANCE, WHEREAS NEPAL TOOK THE PRO-SIHANOUK POSITION. POSITIVE SUPPORT FOR THE KHMER GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AMONG OTHERS BY INDONESEIA, THAILAND, MALAYSIA, SINGAPORE, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN AND, AMONG THE INDUSTRIALIZED FRIENDS OF NEPAL, BY JAPAN, US, UK AND FRG. I TOLD HIM IT WAS FRANKLY VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND NEPAL'S POSITION ON THE KHMER ISSUE AND NOTED THAT THEIR POSITION ON THE KOREAN QUESTION ASSUMED AN EVEN GREATER IMPORTANCE IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR VOTES ON CAMBODIA.</p>
                    <p>3. I WENT ON TO TELL THE FOREIGN MINISTER THAT UNTIL TWO DAYS PREVIOUSLY, WE HAD UNDERSTOOD NEPAL'S POSITION ON KOREA TO BE ABSTENTION ON ALL ASPECTS, BASED ON AMBASSADOR UPADHYAY'S ASSURANCES TO AMBASSADOR BENNETT ON NOVEMBER 21 (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> 5409). I ADDED THAT AS RECENTLY AS DECEMBER 5 BOTH THE JAPANESE AND KOREAN AMBASSADORS HAD TOLD ME THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE NEPALESE POSITION TO BE ABSTENTION. I SAID THAT IT WAS ALMOST BY ACCIDENT THAT WE LEARNED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE INSTRUCTION SENT TO UPADHYAY IN NEW YORK, BUT THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO SUPPORT-WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN TROOPS IN KOREA UNDER THE UN COMMAND” - THE ESSENTIAL THRUST OF THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION. I ADDED THAT IT WAS IN MY VIEW VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE CHANGED NEPALESE POSITION HAD SURFACED AHEAD OF THE VOTE IN NEW YORK SO THAT IT COULD BE DISCUSSED, AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER INDICATED HE AGREED WITH THIS.</p>
                    <p>4. FOLLOWING A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEDURAL ISSUES, I PASSED HIM TEXTS OF BOTH RESOLUTIONS AND FOCUSED HIS ATTENTION PARTICULARLY ON THE FOURTH PREAMBULAR PARAGRAPH OF THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION, CLEARLY DIRECTED AT THE US IN TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE TERMS. I DREW HIS ATTENTION ALSO TO THE OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE THE UNC WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE UNC'S ARMISTICE AND SECURITY FUNCTIONS. I SAID THAT I WONDERED WHETHER THESE PROVISIONS REALLY REPRESENTED NEPALESE VIEWS. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT THE FOREIGN MININSTER WAS SHOCKED BY THE LANGUAGE OF THE FOURTH PREAMBULAR PARAGRAPH AND THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE SEEN THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION BEFORE.</p>
                    <p>5. IN ASKING THE FOREIGN MINISTER TO URGENTLY REVIEW THEIR PRPOSED POSITION ON KOREA WITH A VIEW TO ABSTAINING ACROSS THE BOARD, I NOTED THAT OUR INFORMATION WAS THAT INDIA, SRI LANKA AND BHUTAN WOULD ABSTAIN ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE KOREAN QUESTION AND THAT THIS PROBABLY WOULD BE TRUE ALSO OF PAKISTAN AND BANGLADESH AND THAT NEPAL, UNLESS IT CHANGED ITS POSITION, WOULD BE THE LONE SOUTH ASIAN SUPPORTER OF THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION.</p>
                    <p>6. IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER ACCEPTED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS DEMARCHE. AS REPORTED IN EARLIER CABLES, HE AT ONCE CONFIRMED THAT NEPAL WOULD ABSTAIN ON THE FRIENDLY RESOLUTION AND THE QUESTION OF PRIORITY AND SAID THAT HE WOULD REVIEW PROMPTLY THE OTHER ISSUES, INCLUDING NEPAL'S POSITION ON THE HOSTILE RESOLUTION. WITHIN TWO HOURS WE WERE INFORMED BY THE MFA THAT A “HIGH LEVEL REVIEW” (MEANING THAT THE ISSUE WOULD BE TAKEN TO THE KING) HAD BEEN PUT IN TRAIN BY KARKI. THE OUTCOME, A NEPALESE DECISION TO ABSTAIN ACROSS THE BOARD, WAS REPORTED IN KATHMANDU 5039. THE SENSE OF URGENCY THE NEPALESE ATTACHED TO MODIFYING THEIR PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS IS INDICATED BY THEIR UNUSUAL REQUEST THAT WE UTILIZE OUR RAPID COMMUNCATIONS TO CONVEY THIS INSTRUCTION THROUGH USUN TO UPADHYAY. IN THE ACTUAL VOTING, AS DEPARTMENT IS WELL AWARE, NEPAL DID ABSTAIN ON ALL VOTES EXCEPT ONE PROCEDURAL VOTE. THE NEPALESE ABSTENTION ON THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION WAS CRITICAL, AS IT TURNED OUT, IN THE DEFEAT OF THIS RESOLUTION BY A 48 TO 48 TIE VOTE. (UPADHYAY'S NEGATIVE VOTE ON THE PROCEDURAL MOTION NOT TO VOTE ON THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION, REPORTED TO US IN STATE 27218, WAS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF HIS REVISED INSTRUCTIONS. WE ARE CALLING THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">CARGO</persName>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. THE DAY FOLLOWING THE NEPALESE SHIFT IN OUR DIRECTION ON KOREA, FOREIGN MINISTER KARKI TOOK ME ASIDE AT A SOCIAL EVENT TO SAY THAT HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE CHANGE IN NEPAL'S POSITION, THAT MY DEMARCHE TO HIM HAD BEEN “TIMELY” AND “VERY HELPFUL” IN HIS REOPENING OF THE QUESTION WITH THE PALACE. KARKI BELIEVED NEPAL'S ACTION WOULD HELP MAKE CLEAR THAT THE GON IS MAINTAINING ITS POSITION OF REAL NON-ALIGNMENT.</p>
                    <p>8. ON DECEMBER 10 CHIRAN THAPA, THE KING'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS ADVISER, TOOK ME OFF IN A CORNER AT AN AUSTRALIAN RECEPTION FOR A DISCUSSION OF 30 OR 40 MINUTES DURATION ON THIS SAME RANGE OF ISSUES. HE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT HE HAD HAD “SOMETHING TO DO” WITH NEPAL'S LAST MINUTE CHANGE OF POSITION ON KOREA, THAT HE HAD FULLY INFORMED THE KING OF MY “TIMELY” DEMARCHE TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER, AND THAT HE HOPED THE KOREAN QUESTION HAD WORKED OUT WELL IN N.Y. THE BURDEN OF HIS DISCOURSE WAS THAT NEPAL WAS NOT ABANDONING ITS INDEPENDENT VOTING POSITION. IN ADDITION TO THE SHIFT ON KOREA, WHICH HE SAID WAS NOT SO DIFFICULT BECAUSE NEPAL HAD “NO INTEREST IN KIM IL SUNG,” HE CITED NEPAL'S VOTING IN UNESCO ON THE ANTI-ISRAELI RESOLUTIONS AND THE NEPALESE ABSTENTION ON THE PALESTINIAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. ON THESE ISSUES, THAPS SAID NEPAL WAS ALONE OR ALMOST ALONE AMONG SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES. IN THE UN, HE SAID, NEPAL WAS THE BEST FRIEND OF THE US AMONG SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES.</p>
                    <p>9. WHEN I PRESSED HIM ON THEIR PRO-SIHANOUK POSITION AS BEING, IN MY VIEW,OUT OF LINE WITH THEIR REAL INTERESTS, HE SAID THAT THERE WERE PERSONAL FACTORS IN THAT EQUATION, BY WHICH I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO MEAN THE KING'S FEELING OF PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO A PRO-SIHANOUK POSITION AS THE RESULT OF HIS VISIT TO PEKING. HTAPA ALSO SAID THAT IMPORTANT ISSUES INVOLVING SHARPLY DIVERGENT VIEWS BETWEEN THE US AND CHINA ARE ALWAYS THE HARDEST FOR NEPAL.</p>
                    <p>10. WHEN THAPA REMARKED THAT HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSIONS OF ISSUES TO WHICH WE ATTACHED IMPORTANCE WERE ALWAYS HELPFUL, I RESPONDED THAT THAT WAS PRECISELY WHY THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAD SENT A COMMUNICATION ON CAMBODIA TO HIS MAJESTY. THAPA SAID THAT THE SECRETARY'S LETTER HAD REACHED THE KING IN POKHARA WHEN THE KING WAS UNFORTUNATELY HEAVILY ENGAGED IN LOCAL ISSUES AND UNABLE TO DEVOTE ANY EXTENDED TIME TO AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROBLEM. THAPA ADDED THAT A WRITTEN REPLY TO THE SECRETARY'S LETTER HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND WOULD BE SHORTLY TRANSMITTED.</p>
                    <p>11. COMPLETING HIS OBSERVATION ON THE VALUE OF HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSION, THAPA SAID HE HOPED THE US DELEGATION TO THE CORONATION WOULD BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF CAMBODIA. HE FELT THIS “COULD BE MOST HELPFUL”. GIVING US A SLIGHT NEEDLE AS WELL AS PUTTING IN A PLUG FOR HIGH LEVEL VISITS BY US OFFICIALS, THAPA SAID THAT IF THE SECRETARY COULD HAVE DISCUSSED THE KHMER ISSUE IN NEPAL DURING HIS VISIT TO SOUTH ASIA, HE THOUGHT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROBLEM. HE SAID THE EARLIER VISIT OF DEPUTY SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">RUSH</persName> AND UNDERSECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> TO NEPAL HAD BEEN VERY USEFUL.</p>
                    <p>12. THAPA EMPHASIZED REPEATEDLY NEPAL'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENT VOTING STANCE AND HIS DESIRE TO DISCUSS WITH US ANY QUESTIONS TO WHICH WE ATTACH PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE.</p>
                    <p>13. COMMENT: I INTERPRET THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS RELATING TO THESE TWO IMPORTANT <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> ISSUES AND THENEPALESE COMMENTS AND REACTIONS SUMMARIZED ABOVE US MEANING THAT THE NEPALESE WISH US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE REGISTERED OUR CONCERNS, THAT THEY DO NOT INTEND A MAJOR POLICY DEPARTURE FROM THEIR GENERALLY MODERATE NONALIGNED STANCE, AND THAT THEY MAY BE READY TO LOOK AGAIN AT THEIR POSITION ON THE KHMER ISSUE IN THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>1. REF A HIT US JUST AS WE WERE PREPARING INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU TO DELIVER STRONG REPRESENTATIONS TO THE GON. FROM YOUR REPORT, IT APPEARS THE <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> IS FINALLY TAKING THIS WHOLE MATTER SERIOUSLY. YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB AND WE APPRECIATE IT. -</p>
                    <p>2. WE BELIEVE IT WOULD NOW BE TIMELY FOR YOU TO MAKE ONE FURTHER APPROACH ON THE POTENTIAL KHMER CREDENTIALS ISSUE AND A PITCH FOR AT LEAST CONTINUED ABSTENTION ON KOREAN MATTERS. THE FOLLOWING TALKING POINTS ARE FOR YOUR USE.</p>
                    <p>3. YOU SHOULD REAFFIRM OUR GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT WITH NEPAL'S VOTE IN THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON KHMER REPRESENTATION.</p>
                    <p>4. WE STRONGLY HOPE THAT NEPAL WILL VOTE AGAINST ANY CHALLENGE ON THE KHMER CREDENTIALS IF THIS SHOULD ARISE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. (FYI: CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE DECEMBER 12 REPORTED OUT GKR CREDENTIALS FAVORABLY 5 (US) - 1 (PRC) - 3) YOU SHOULD EXPAIN (A) CREDENTIALS ARE A TECHNICAL MATTER AND NOT THE PROPER VEHICLE FOR DISCUSSION OR DECISION OF POLITICAL QUESTIONS; AND (B) IT WOULD, IN EFFECT, REOPEN THE KHMER QUESTION AT T;IS SESSION, EVEN THOUGH THE GA HAS DECIDED TO TAKE NO FURTHER ACTION UNTIL THE SECRETARY GENERAL'S REPORT IS RECEIVED BY THE 30TH SESSION.</p>
                    <p>5. WE APPRECIATE NEPAL'S ABSTENTION ON THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION ON KOREA AND HOPE THAT IF IT CANNOT SUPPORT THE FRIENDLY RESOLUTION AS APPROVED BY THE FIRST COMMITTEE, IT WILL AT LEAST CONTINUE ITS POLICY OF ABSTENTION ON KOREAN MATTERS IN THE PLENARY VOTE EXPECTED NEXT WEEK.

                    <p rend="center">Sikkim</p>
                    <p>The reports of trouble in Sikkim come as no surprise. It has been clear for more than a month that forces supporting Sikkimese Chief Minister Dorji and those behind the Chogyal were moving toward a showdown. According to press reports, India has now forcibly disarmed the Palace Guards, the last vestige of real power left to the Chogyal; and we believe it probable his days are numbered.</p>
                    <p>Shortly before the amendment to the Indian constitution making Sikkim an associate state went into effect March 1, the Chogyal generated considerable criticism by his comments in Kathmandu (where he attended KING BIRENDRA's oronation as a personal guest). He charged that Sikkim did not have a fully responsible government and declared he would leave “no stone unturned” in seeing Sikkim's separate identity preserved.</p>
                    <p>With steadily increasing antagonism, the Sikkim Congress first staged demonstrations against his return to Sikkim, then called several times for his removal. Chief Minister Dorji also forbade members of the government from meeting with the Chogyal and refused to talk with him directly. There have also been charges that the Chogyal's Palace Guard was being used to undermine Dorji or even to assassinate him. India's Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SK2">KEWAL SINGH</persName> recently visited Gangtok and the GOI subsequently warned the Chogyal not to"interfere” with the democratic process in Sikkim.</p>
                    <p>We have no information on a “coup” reported in a ham radio broadcast from the Sikkim <pb n="2" xml:id="d258-02" facs="d258-02"/>Palace and picked up in Tehran. Our guess is that the broadcast may have been an effort by the Chogyal to generate international support to forestall the disarming of his guard. We assume Delhi will be reporting fully when the facts become clearer.</p>
                    <p>We can expect some press and Congressional interest here if the Chogyal is in fact removed, especially because his wife, the former Hope Cooke, is in the U.S. (She has made informal inquiries through intermediaries regarding procedures for her to remain here). There has been a steady stream of correspondence, for example, from a group called the Friends of Sikkim (Senator Pell and Congressman Symington are sponsors) urging us to raise the Sikkim affair at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We have “held to the line that we are not involved in this problem and see no reason to change our position in light of current developments.</p>

The Sikkim Assembly is reportedly seeking to abolish the monarchy and to gain full Indian statehood. The Assembly has also apparently promised to put the question to some kind of referendum, but whether the Chogyal can hang on in Gangtok until then is a moot question. He may now be under some form of house arrest and the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will likely come down hard on him.

                        <persName corresp="#p_GE3">Eric Gonsalves</persName> said he expected the Chogyal to be removed and Sikkim fully merged with India quickly.</p>
                    <p>On an urgent basis we are reviewing the policy implications of such a development and preparing contingency press guidance as well as talking points for responding to Congressional inquiries. We are also looking into how we might handle a possible request for political asylum in the U.S. by the Chogyal.</p>

                    <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: The next step in the disappearance of Sikkim has taken place. There was a plebiscite and as expected they have asked to join India as a constituent state.</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: What is the Indian obsession with annexing Sikkim?</p>
                    <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: It is their obsession with the Himalayan frontier.</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: Then why not Nepal? Is that next?</p>
                    <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: That would be a little more difficult. They are a member of the United Nations. In fact, I don't think they really wanted to take this last step, until the Chogyal tried to assert more authority than he had. And he made some statements at the coronation of the King of Nepal publicly, which upset the Indians. So they just finally decided that they had gone too far, and disarmed his palace guard. The Sikkim Assembly voted to request inclusion — a plebiscite. And it will become just another Indian state. And the Chogyal will probably — you may well get a request for him to come here, since his wife is here.</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: We will accept it, won't we?</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="d260-03" facs="d260-03"/>
                    <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: I think so. It has a nice esoteric complication, because his wife gave up her citizenship to marry him.</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>: I think the country can stand the Chogyal of Sikkim.</p>
                    <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1">ATHERTON</persName>: There are enough people in Congress interested in this.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>SUMMARY—SIKKIM OFFCIALLY BECAME THE TWENTY-SECOND STATE OF INDIA ON MAY 16 WITH THE DECLARATION OF PRESIDENTIAL ASSENT TO THE RATIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BY A MAJORITY OF THE INDIAN STATES. THE INDIAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN GAGTOK HAS BEEN NAMED THE STATE'S FIRST GOVERNOR AND THE INSTITUTION OF CHOGYAL STANDS ABOLISHED. INDIA'S CURRENT LEADERS, HAVING SOUGHT TO TIE SIKKIM'S FUTURE EXPRESSLY TO INDIA IN RECENT YEARS - ARE MANIFESTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF SIKKIM'S “PROTECTORATE” STATUS, BUT THIS DEVELOPMENT ALSO HAS TO BE SEEN AS THE CULMINATION OF A CENTURY-LONG HISTORICAL PROCESS. WHILE THE CHOGYAL PROBLEM HAS NOW APPARENTLY BEEN RESOLVED, OTHER PROBLEMS LIE IN WAIT. END SUMMARY.</p>
                    <p>1. PRESIDENT FAKHRUDDIN ALI Ahmed GAVE HIS FORMAL ASSENT MAY 16 TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT MAKING SIKKIM THE TWENTY-SECOND STATE OF THE INDIAN UNION. MORE THAT HALF OF THE INDIAN STATES' LEGISLATURES HAD PREVIOUSLY RATIFIED THE AMENDMENT IN ACCORD WITH THE INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT. ON THE SAME DAY THE CURRENT CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN GANGTOK, B.B. LAL, WAS SWORN IN AS THE NEW STATE'S FIRST GOVERNOR. TO GIVE FULL EFFECT TO SIKKIM'S NEW STATUS, THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS ALSO ABOLISHED THE POST OF THE POLITICAL OFFICER IN GANGTOK AND TRANSFERRED CENTRAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SIKKIMESE AFFAIRS FROM THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS TO THE HOME MINISTRY. THE INSTITUTION OF THE CHOGYAL IS ABOLISHED BUT THE QUESTION OF WHERE THE FORMER CHOGYAL WILL RESIDE AND WHAT WILL BE DONE WITH THE PROPERTIES HELD IN HIS NAME REMAIN TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE NEW SIKKIM STATE ADMINISTRATION AND BY THE FORMER CHOGYAL HIMSELF.</p>
                    <p>2. SIKKIM'S INCORPORATION INTO THE INDIAN UNION CONCLUDES A CENTURY-LONG HISTORICAL PROCESS BY WHICH THE TINY PRINCELY STATE WAS REDUCED TO THE CONTROL OF THE DOMINANT POWER TO THE SOUTH. ALTHOUGH INDIA'S CURRENT LEADERS BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FULL ABSORPTION OF SIKKIM INTO THE INDIAN UNION AND THE FORMAL LOSS OF ITS SEPARATE “PROTECTORATE” IDENTITY, THERE HAS BEEN A CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC INEVITABILITY TO THE WHOLE PROCESS: BECAUSE THE TRADITIONAL TRADE ROUTE FROM INDIA TO TIBET RAN THROUGH SIKKIM IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY (NOT THROUGH BHUTAN) AND THE BRITISH WISHED TO ENCOURAGE TRADE WITH TIBET, IT WAS FELT THAT THE AREA HAD TO BE BROUGHT UNDER SOME CONTROL. A CENTURY LATER INDIA'S LEADERS - FEARING THAT THIS SAME TRADE ROUTE MIGHT SERVE AS A CHINESE INVASION ROUTE - CLAMPED THIS CONTROL STILL TIGHTER. THE PRESSURE EXERTED FROM THE SOUTH FLUCTUATED FROM DECADE TO DECADE DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, BUT ESSENTIALLY ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE LOCAL RULER WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND THE EXTENT OF THE DANGER TO THE AREA'S SECURITY FROM EXTERNAL FORCES, AS PERCEIVED BY THE BRITISH AND - LATER - INDIANS. HISTORICALLY SIKKIM'S SLIDE INTO TOTAL SUBORDINATION TO INDIA PROBABLY BEGAN WITH THE BRITISH DECISION TO POST A RESIDENT OFFICER IN GANGTOK IN 1889 AFTER A SERIES OF TIBETAN DEPREDATIONS IN THE AREA. AS THE OXFORD HISTORY OF INDIA STATES (IN TREATING THE AMIR OF AFGHANISTAN'S REFUSAL TO ACCEPT SUCH A RESIDENT IN 1877), “IT WAS THE GENERAL BELIEF IN THE EAST THAT THE ADVENT OF A BRITISH RESIDENT AT A DURBAR COMMONLY FORESHADOWED THE END OF ITS INDEPENDENCE.” INTERESTINGLY NO BRITISH RESIDENT WAS EVER POSTED IN MORE ISOLATED BHUTAN, WHICH UNLIKE SIKKIM HAS LARGELY RETAINED ITS INDEPENDENCE.</p>
                    <p>3. POST-COLONIAL INDIA APPEARED SATISFIED WITH SIKKIM'S STATUS AS A “PROTECTORATE”, WITH UNCONTESTED INDIAN CONTROL OF ITS EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE AND BROAD POWERS TO INTERVENE IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS RELATING TO SECURITY, UNTIL THE ERUPTION OF THE SINO-INDIAN CONFLICT IN THE EARLY 1950'S. SINCE THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> COULD TAKE WHATEVER STEPS IT DEEMED APPROPRIATE FOR INDIAN SECURITY IN THE REGION, SIKKIM'S STATUS AS A “PROTECTORATE” DID NOT POSE AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM. BUT THE CLASH WITH CHINA HAD THE EFFECT OF INJECTING A STRONG DOSE OF REALPOLITIK IN INDIA'S POLICIES. IT ALSO FOCUSED DELHI'S ATTENTION ON THE ANOMALIES AND THE AMBIGUITIES WHICH EXISTED IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE HIMALAYAN STATES: THUS THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> PON- DERED THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF NEHRU'S SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT TO THE BRITISH MODUS OPERANDI IN THE HIMALAYAS, THE 1950 TREATY BETWEEN THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> AND THE CHOGYAL'S FATHER HAD LEFT SIKKIM A SUBSTANTIAL AREA OF AUTONOMY OVER ITS INTERNAL AFFAIRS, AND LEFT WHOLLY UNDEFINED THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF SIKKIM'S DEVELOPMENT. IN A SOCIETY LESS PREOCCUPIED WITH LEGAL FORMS AND MORE CONFIDENT OF ITS OWN FUTURE, SUCH LAGUAGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IGNORED. BUT WITH THE CHOGYAL DEMONSTRATING AN INTEREST IN INDEPENDENCE AND SEEMING TO WANT TO FOLLOW THE BHUTANESE MODEL IN BREAKING OUT OF ISOLATION, WITH THE OUTBREAK OF ULTRA- LEFTIST VIOLENCE IN WEST BENGAL, WITH THE POLITICIZATION OF THE NEPALESE MAJORITY IN SIKKIM, AND A PALPABLE INCREASE IN NEPALESE NATIONALISM ON ITS PERIPHERY, THE FEELING THAT SIKKIM'S STATUS SHOULD BE FORMALLY REDEFINED, AND HER FUTURE COMMITMENT TO INDIA MADE EXPRESS, GAINED SUPPORT THROUGH THE 1950'S AND SOON BECAME A <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> OBJECTIVE, EVEN IF NEVER FORMALLY ANNOUNCED AS SUCH.</p>
                    <p>4. THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> INITIALLY SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE THROUGH SECRET BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CHOGYAL. (NEW DELHI POLNOTE MARCH 11, 1975 NOTAL). IN 1971/72, AFTER THE ADMISSION OF THE PRC AND BHUTAN TO THE UNITED NATIONS, THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> QUIETLY PROPOSED TO THE RULER THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE 1950 TREATY DECLARING SIKKIM A PROTECTORATE BE REPLACED BY THE PROVISION “SIKKIM SHALL BE IN PERMANENT ASSOCIATION WITH INDIA…” THE CHOGYAL BALKED, HOWEVER, AND NEGOTIATIONS SOON BROKE DOWN. BUT IN 1973 ANTI-CHOGYAL PROTESTS (TOLERATED IF NOT NURTURED BY THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>) ERUPTED IN GANGTOK, AND THE STAGE WAS SET FOR THE CHOGYAL'S ENEMIES, BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT SIKKIM TO RECAST SIKKIM AS AN ASSOCIATE STATE. AS SOON BECAME EMBARRASSINGLY CLEAR TO THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, A CON- STITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL MUDDLE RESULTED. WHEN A FURTHER BREAKDOWN IN PUBLIC ORDER THREATENED IN EARLY 1975, THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> TOOK UNCHARACTERISTICALLY DECISIVE ACTION TO TRANSFORM SIKKIM INTO A FULL-FLEDGED-INDIAN STATE.</p>
                    <p>5. IN LEGISLATING SIKKIM'S FULL STATEHOOD, THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> HAS ANTICIPATED THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE EMERGENCIES IN THE REGION BY VESTING THE CENTRALLY-APPOINTED GOVERNOR WITH EXPANDED POWERS (NEW DELHI 5359 NOTAL). AT THIS POINT NEW DELHI APPEARS DETERMINED NOT TO LET MATTERS SLIP OUT OF CONTROL AGAIN. IF PROBLEMS DO ARISE, THEY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RELATE TO THE GROWING ASSERTIVENESS OF SIKKIM'S NEPALESE MAJORITY, FOR LONG DOMINATED BY THE LEPCHA/BHUTIA COMMUNITY OF WHICH THE CHOGYAL AND PRESENT PRIME MINISTER, KAZIL LHENDUP DORJI, HAVE BEEN THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLES. OUR CONSULATE IN CALCUTTA HAS NOTED A GROWING ANTI-INDIAN FEELING AMONG THE NEPALESE COMMUNITIES IN SIKKIM, SOUTHERN BHUTAN AND NORTHERN WEST BENGAL (ESPECIALLY AT DARJEELING, THE GORKHA LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS) AND A TENDENCY FOR TRANS-BORDER COOPERATION AMONG ACTIVISTS FROM THESE COMMUNITIES. NOW THAT THE COMMON ENEMY THE CHOGYAL HAS BEEN DEPOSED, THE NEPALESE ON ONE HAND AND THE AGED KAZI AND HIS INDIAN PROTECTORS ON THE OTHER MAY INCREAS- INGLY DRAW APART. THE YOUNG NEPALESE POLITICIANS IN SIKKIM, AND ESPECIALLY THE YOUTHFUL FIREBRANDS WHO DOMINATE THE SCENE BELOW THE KAZI, AND WHO HAVE LINKS WITH INDIA'S COMMUNIST PARTY (MARXIST), ARE ALREADY COM- PLAINING ABOUT THE SPECIAL POWERS GRANTED THE GOVERNOR, POWERS WHICH WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM CARRYING OUT EX- TENSIVE LAND REFORMS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE BHUTIA/LEPCHA COMMUNITY, AND FROM OTHERWISE ADVANCING THEIR OWN COMMUNAL AND ULTIMATELY PAN-NEPALESE INTERESTS. THE INDIANS WHILE RESOLVING THEIR CHOGYAL PROBLEM, MAY THUS HAVE SET THE SCENE FOR EVEN MORE POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE FUTURE.</p>
                    <p>6. ALTHOUGH SIKKIM'S FULL ABSORPTION INTO INDIA APPARENTLY MARKS THE END OF A LONG HISTORICAL PROCESS, THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> SEEMS PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE ISSUE AS SUCH WILL NOT SOON DISAPPEAR. THE PRC HAS LOUDLY PROCLAIMED THAT IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, ALTHOUGH WHETHER THIS MEANS THAT THE PRC STILL CONSIDERS SIKKIM AN INDIAN PROTECTORATE OR REJECTS EVEN THAT DESCRIPTION AS SMACKING OF COLONIALISM UNCLEAR. WHILE THE CHINESE AND THE PAKISTANIS MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE ERFERENCE TO SIKKIM AS THE ISSUE SUITS THEIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PROPA- GANDA REQUIREMENTS, THIS SHOULD NOT SURPRISE NOR UNDULY UPSET THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, ALTHOUGH IT MAY FEEL OBLIGED TO RESPOND IN KIND ON OCCASION. INDIA'S OTHER NEIGHBORS ARE EXPECTED BY THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> TO BEHAVE MORE DISCREETLY. THUS THE GOI PROBABLY FEELS IT CAN TOLERATE SOME SNIPING BY THE NEPALESE NEWSPAPERS AND OFFICIALS IN PRIVATE BUT IT WON'T HESITATE TO COMPLAIN IF IT SUSPECTS OFFICIAL SPONSORSHIP OR INDULGENCE OF MORE SYSTEMATIC ANTI-INDIAN CAMPAIGNING ON THIS ISSUE. THE <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> MAY NOW BE AWAITING HOW THE MOSCOW REPORTS THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT (MOSCOW 5598 NOTAL). PRAVDA POSITIVELY AND PROMPTLY REPORTED SIKKIM'S CONVERSION INTO AN ASSOCIATE STATE; WE UNDER- STAND IT HAS REMAINED SILENT SO FAR ON SIKKIM'S STATEHOOD, ALTHOUGH MOSCOW SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH THE EMERGENCE OF YET ANOTHER CONTENTIOUS, SEEMINGLY IRRESOLVABLE ISSUE IN SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS.</p>

                    <p>SUMMARY: IN AUGUST 15 MEETING WITH UNDER SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>, BHUTANESE UN PERMREP TSHERING CALLED OVERTHROW OF <persName corresp="#p_RSM1">SHEIKH MUJIB</persName> “UNFORTUNATE”, DESCRIBED RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND CHINA AS “GOOD” AND “CORRECT, RESPECTIVELY, AND AGREED WITH <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>'S VIEW THAT UN SHOULD STRIVE FOR COOPERATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> EXPLAINED U.S. POLICY IN SOUTH ASIA AND DESIRE FOR STABILITY IN REGION AND STRESSED NEED TO AVOID CONFRONTATION AND RHETORIC IN <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. END SUMMARY.</p>
                    <p>1. BHUTAN'S PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, DAGO TSHERING, ACCOMPANIED BY SECOND SECRETARY GURUNG, CALLED ON UNDER SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> AUGUST 15. <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_DA1">DUBS</persName> AND COUNTRY OFFICER <persName corresp="#p_LR4">LORTON</persName> SAT IN.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> ASKED TSHERING FOR BHUTAN'S VIEWS ON SUBCONTINENT, RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND CHINA, AND REACTION TO BANGLADESH COUP. TSHERING CALLED MUJIB'S OVERTHROW UNFORTUNATE AND EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF MUJIB HAD WORKED HARD AND HAD PEOPLE'S RESPECT. HE THOUGHT SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME REMAINED TO BE SEEN. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> EXPRESSED SURPRISE MUJIB'S LIFE HAD NOT BEEN SPARED GIVEN HIS ROLE IN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT BUT NOTED BANGLADESH PLAGUED BY ENORMOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND MUJIB NOT NOTED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY.</p>
                    <p>3. NOTING BHUTAN WAS A SMALL, LANDLOCKED STATE, TSHERING DESCRIBED RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA AS GOOD. HE ADDED THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS ADVANTAGES FOR BHUTAN, INCLUDING INDIAN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA IS “CORRECT.” BHUTANESE PRESENTLY HAPPY WITH THEIR SITUATION AND <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss> DID NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO INTERFERE WITH BHUTANESE PEOPLE'S BASIC SIMPLICITY AND LOVE OF RELIGION.</p>
                    <p>4. TSHERING OBSERVED BHUTAN HAD ONLY A LIMITED CAPACITY TO ABSORB CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND LARGE DOSES OF AID, BUT CONCENTRATION WAS ON DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL SCALE, AGRICULTURALLY ORIENTED INDUSTRIES THROUGH ASSISTANCE FROM INDIA AND UNDP. HE ADDED THAT PEOPLE HAVE TREMENDOUS CONFIDENCE IN THE KING AND HIS ABILITY TO LEAD THE COUNTRY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> ASSURED TSHERING THERE WOULD BE A CONTINUING MANIFESTATION OF AMERICAN INTEREST IN SOUTH ASIA. WE SUPPORT THE SIMLA PROCESS, DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYONE'S INDEPENDENCE EXTINGUISHED NOR ANY ONE POWER DOMINATE THE REGION. WE HAVE STAYED OUT, BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY, OF INTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIA. OUR INTEREST IN BANGLADESH, WHERE WE HAVE BEEN THE PRINCIPAL SUPPORTER OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IS PRIMARILY HUMANITARIAN. WE SEE OUR INTERESTS BEST SERVED BY DEVELOPMENT OF STABILITY IN AREA. SISCO ALSO INVITED TSHERING TO LET US KNOW IF WE COULD BE HELPFUL TO BHUTAN IN ANY WAY.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> ALSO ASKED FOR TSHERING'S VIEWS ON THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, THE SPECIAL SESSION, THE PRODUCER-CONSUMER DIALOGUE, AND POLITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS KOREA AND THE SUSPENSION OF ISRAEL. TSHERING SAID BHUTAN AS A SMALL, LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRY, COULD NOT EXPECT TO BENEFIT VERY DIRECTLY EVEN IF SPECTACULAR DEVELOPMENTS OCCURED AT THE SPECIAL SESSION. HOWEVER, AS A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, AND RECOGNIZING THE INTERESTS OF OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, BHUTAN SAW SUCH MEETINGS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET TOGETHER AND ESTABLISH BASIC PRINCIPLES OUT OF A CONSENSUS.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName> SAID IT WAS OUR OBJECTIVE AT THE SPECIAL SESSION TO SEE WHETHER A PRODUCER-CONSUMER DIALOGUE OF A SERIOUS NATURE ON CONCRETE PROBLEMS COULD TAKE PLACE. NOTHING PRACTICAL COULD COME FROM GRANDIOSE RIGID OR IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS. WHAT IS NEEDED IS AN APPROACH BASED ON THE PROVEN PRINCIPLE OF INTERDEPENDENCE. WE RECOGNIZE, FOR EXAMPLE, DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WANT ASSURANCES ON STABILIZING EARNINGS FROM COMMODITY EXPORTS AND ARE PREPARED TO ADDRESS THAT SORT OF SPECIFIC PROBLEM. WE WILL PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE OF INTEREST TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AND WE HOPE THAT EVERYONE WILL ACT WITH RESTRAINT TO AVOID CONFRONTATION AND RHETORIC. TSHERING AGREED WITH THIS VIEW. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">SISCO</persName>

AT THE SAME TIME I POINTED OUT RETROGRESSIVE ATTITUDE OF NORTH KOREANSE INCLUDING THEIR REFUSAL TO ENVISAGE SOUTH KOREAN PARTICIPATION IN ANY FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS. NOTING THAT NEPAL'S TRADITIONAL INCLINATION MIGHT BE TO KSTAIN, I URGED UPON KHATRI THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> EXAMINE ITS POSITION WITH A VIEW TO A DECISION TO VOTE AGAINST THE NORTH KOREAN RESOLUTION AND IN FAVOR OF THE APPROACH SET OUT IN THE SECRETARY'S SPEECH. I NOTED THAT THIS QUESTION WOULD BE RAISED WITH FOREIGN MINISTER AYAL WHEN HE VISITS WASHINGTON OCTOBER 8 AND EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> WOULD DECIDE TO SUPPORT AFFIRMATIVELY OUR EFFORTS AIMED AT PRESERVING PEACE AND STABILITY IN THIS VITAL AREA OF ASIA.</p>
                    <p>3. KHATRI LISTENED CAREFULLY AND SAID THAT THE NORTH KOREAN POSITION IN SEEKING TO EXCLUDE SOUTH KOREA FROM DISCUSSIONS WAS BOTH UNREALISTIC AND CONTRARY TO NEPAL'S VIEW THAT ALL PARTIES TO A DISPUTE SHOULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WPTHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM OUTSIDE FORCES. HE REFLECTED THAT NORTH KOREAN INTRANSIGENCE ON THIS ISSUE COULD SERVE AS A RATIONALE FOR NEPALESE OPPOSITION TO NORTH KOREAN RESOLUTION. WHILE MAKING NO PROMISE THAT THE <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> POSITION WOULD BE CHANGED, KHATRI DID SAY HE WOULD STUDY WITH CARE TEXT OF NEW RESOLUTION WHEN AVAILABLE AND WOULD “RECOMMEND OUR VIEWS TO PALACE OFFICIALS CONCERNED.”</p>
                    <p>4. COMMENT: DESPITE KHATRI'S FORTHCOMING REMARKS THE PROBLEM OF GETTING THE <gloss target="#t_GON1">GON</gloss> TO MOVE TO POSITION OF AFFIRMATIVE SUPPORT FOR OUR RESOLUTION AND OPPOSITION TO THE NORTH KOREAN DRAFT IS A LARGE ONE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE STRONG REPRESENTATIONS HERE. PLEASE ADVISE US ON CONVERSATIONS WITH ARYAL.</p>

                        <item>Long history of US assistance to Nepal has probably had significant, albeit indirect, effect on development of respect for basic human rights. A feudal society only 25 years ago, Nepal has made rapid progress in developing a political system which if autocratic, cannot be described as authoritarian. [text not declassified]</item>

                        <item>Our greatest impact in the human rights area is probably the experiences gained by over 2000 AID participants trained in Western—particularly American-value systems, including the respect for basic human dignity. These persons have risen to positions of considerable importance and leadership in the society and their influence has been felt all the more given the limited numbers of educated persons to man key positions throughout the country. It is no exaggeration to say that it is difficult to find administrators at the joint secretary or above in virtually all government offices who have not been exposed at one time or another to American values through direct experience. This elite constitutes a fairly important pressure group in assuring that basic human rights are not trampled upon, even in a country whose monarchical powers are supreme. They are, for example, the “intellectual class” which has successfully pressed for the release of political prisoners in Nepal and which has forced the government to restrict the application of “catch-all-laws” used in the past to harrass political dissidents.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Through our emphasis on creating an adequate <pb n="3" xml:id="d264-03" facs="d264-03"/>infrastructure in health and education we have successfully created new institutions which not only aid the economically and intellectually depressed rural areas of Nepal, but also institutions which provide direct participation by relatively large segments of society. Although it is difficult to make a definitive judgment on larger philosophical question cif whether economic assistance promotes human rights, experience over 25 years in Nepal indicates slow, but steady, progress towards a political and economic system promoting and protecting basic rights. In that period the use of cruel and inhuman punishment has all but disappeared: arbitrary arrest has been vastly reduced, and the right of freedom of expression, although not comparable to the United States, is not severely restricted. It is something of an anomaly that Nepal, one of the few remaining monarchies in the world, currently enjoys more fundamental rights than other countries in the area.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>That this situation exists is, in part at least, the result of increasing confidence of the nation's leadership that economic development need not be a threat to political stability. US assistance through aiding the country's economic development has likely increased Nepal's political stability and confidence in maintaining a sovereign and independent state without the need to resort to immoral or inhuman methods to remain in power.</item>

                        <item>Consequently, we believe our development programs have had a positive if largely indirect impact on human rights in Nepal. However, we have not in the past directed our programs specifically on human rights. While we believe opportunities to carry out programs in such politically sensitive areas by foreign aid donors are very constrained, we do believe there are some limited ways in which we can directly help enhance or protect those rights. For example, we would support a modest program to provide financial assistance to organizations such as “World Peace Through Law” to allow Nepalese participation. Similarly direct assistance to “Amnesty International”, which has played an important “watch dog” role in Nepal, or the International Commission of Jurists would not only demonstrate our continuing concern over human rights but would have a direct effect on those <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> officials concerned with the administration of justice. A SEADAG conference, although politically sensitive, devoted to the broader question of human rights and development efforts could serve the same purpose. Above all, we would urge an increase in exchanges and participant grants to be devoted to those directly involved, be they local administrators or central government authorities in the field of law.</item>

                        <item>VISIT OF UN NARCOTICS OFFICIALS</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>1. A TEAM OF OFFICIALS, LED BY MR. DITTERT, FROM THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> FUND FORDRUG ABUSE CONTROL (<gloss target="#t_UNFDAC1">UNFDAC</gloss>) VISITED NEPAL FROM JUNE 30 TO JULY 6 AT THE INVITATION OF THE SECRETARY FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE, DEVENDRA RAJ UPADHYAYA. DITTERT MET WITH EMBASSY OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS OF THE VISIT.</p>
                    <p>2. DITTERT SAID THAT THE TEAM WAS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT NEPALESE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE DRUG PROBLEM HAD IMPROVED IN RECENT YEARS. HE NOTED THAT THE VERY FACT THAT THE <gloss target="#t_UNFDAC1">UNFDAC</gloss> HAD BEEN INVITED TO COME WAS BUT ONE INDICATION THAT SOME OFFICIALS, AT LEAST, REALIZED THAT STEPS MUST BE TAKEN TO STEM THE FLOW OF NARCOTICS, CHIEFLY HASISH, FROM THE COUNTRY.</p>
                    <p>3. DITTERT SAID THAT IT NOW APPEARED THAT THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> DRAFTED LEGISLATION AIMED AT NARCOTICS CONTROL WAS BEING HELD UNDER TIGHT WRAPS IN THE MIN OF FINANCE. HE COULD GIVE NO EXPLANATION WHY THE DRAFT WAS BEING KEPT SECRET, ALTHOUGH HE HAZARDED THE GUESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT WANT OPPOSITION TO BUILD UP AGAINST THE BILL IN ADVANCE. HE ALSO ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BILL WAS SO FULL OF LOOPHOLES THAT <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> OFFICIALS DID NOT WANT TO REVEAL IT TO UN OFFICIALS. HE DOUBTED THAT THE DRAFT WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, OR AT LEAST NOT UNTIL SERIOUS STUDY HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FAMRMERS IN THE HILL REGIONS WHO RELY ON HASISH CULTIVATION AS A MONEY CROP.</p>
                    <p>4. THE <gloss target="#t_UNFDAC1">UNFDAC</gloss> OFFICIALS, ENCOURAGED BY THEIR DISCUSSIONS, APPEAR WILLING TO RECOMMEND SOME SORT OF <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> PROGRAM FOR NEPAL, IF ONLY TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT MOMENTUM AND TO STRESS THE CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL CONCERN OVER CANNABIS EMANATING FROM NEPAL. THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION REQUESTED THE FUND'S ASSISTANCE IN LAUNCHING A MULTI-DISCIPLINE STUDY OF LAND USE AND CULTIVATION PRACTICES IN WESTERN HILLS. SUCH A STUDY WOULD DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF CANNABIS PRODUCTION, TRAFFIC PATTERNS, AND WOULD ALSO EXPLORETHE POSSIBILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE CROPS AND THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS A TOTAL BAN ON CULTIVATION MIGHT BRING TO THE AREA. DITTERT FELT THAT SUCH STUDY WOULD PROVE USEFUL AND IS PREPARED TO RECOMMEND IT TO THE FUND.</p>
                    <p>5. DURING HIS VISIT DITTERT STRESSED THE NEED FOR INCREASED PENALTIES ON SMUGGLERS, SINCE THE PRESENT LAW ACTS AS LITTLE OR NO DETERRENT TO TRAFFICKING. HE ALSO IS NOW APPEARING IN THE KATHMANDU AREA FROM THAILAND, AS WELL AS OVER THE REPORT THAT OPIUM POPPIES ARE UNDER CULTIVATION.</p>
                    <p>6. COMMENT: THE <gloss target="#t_UNFDAC1">UNFDAC</gloss> TEAM IS WELL AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF PARTICIPATION BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN ILLICIT TRAFFICKING, BUT WE SHARE THEIR VIEW THAT A CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO REDUCE SMUGGLINE IS IMPORTANT. A UN STUDY OF THE WESTERN HILLS WOULD APPEAR TO US TO BE USEFUL ADJUNCT TO OUR ONWN EFFORTS AIMED AT IMPROVING ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES AND COULD PROVE TO BE A NECESSITY IF NARCOTICS LEGILSATION IS EVER TO BEN ENACTED IN THE COUNTRY. AT VERY LEAST IT WOULD BRING HOME TO CONCERNED OFFICIALS THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM IN NEPAL. WE WOULD HOPE, THEREFORE, THAT THE FUND WILL ENDORSE THE TEAM'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT A STUDY EFFORT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED AS EARLY AS OCTOBER 1976.</p>
