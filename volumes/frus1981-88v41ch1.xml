                    1981–1989, Volume XLI</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the Reagan Library. Within the Reagan Library’s
                    collection, <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Michael Guhin</persName>’s files, the
                    National Security Council Subject File, <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Ralph
                        Bledsoe</persName>’s records of the Domestic Policy Council, and a copy of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George P. Shultz</persName> Papers organized by
                    subject were the most helpful.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain both cable traffic as well as key memoranda.
                    The Department’s lot files were particularly useful, especially when looking for
                    inter-bureau memoranda regarding whaling, the ozone layer, <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and population control. Two Assistant
                    Secretaries of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                        >Richard Schifter</persName>, both have voluminous lot files. The lot files
                    for Deputy Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth Dam</persName>, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_WJC_1">John Whitehead</persName> contained valuable
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume also involved examining records from the Department of
                    Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the
                    Vice Presidential Materials at the <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W.
                        Bush</persName> Library. Some material from the Agency for International
                    Development is already declassified and available at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration at College Park in Record Group 286. The Office of the
                    Historian was also able to gain access to the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                        >Alexander M. Haig</persName> Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>Researchers will find records in Department of State lot files helpful. Lot
                    90D327 contains most of the records from the United Nations Third World
                    Conference on Women in Nairobi, and Lot 92D207 has several boxes with
                    information about the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s policy regarding acid rain.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                            Speakes responded by asking, “What’s <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>?” The reporter clarified: “It’s known as ‘gay

                            three people that get this have died.” Speakes remarked, “I don’t have
                            it. Do you?” When asked if the White House was familiar with the
                            disease, Speakes said, “I don’t think so.” He further commented, “There

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_MMED_1">M/MED</gloss> has contacted Dr. Drotman from
                                <gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss> (Center for Disease Control).
                            He has just returned from Haiti on an investigation on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> (acquired immune deficiency
                            syndrome) among Haitians.</p>
                        <p>2. Medical surveillance on this rare disease is inadequate in Haiti,
                            therefore, at this point no one can quantify the exact risk factor of
                            this disease. In the U.S. there has been only 600 cases over the last
                            two years. Dr. Drotman is not aware of a case of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in a non Haitian living in
                            Haiti.</p>
                        <p>3. There is no evidence that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> can
                            be transmitted via food or water. It is not related to nutritional
                            defects or related to poverty. In review of the cases of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> among Haitians it appears it is not
                            particularly related to how recently they immigrated to the U.S. The
                            hypothesis is that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is transmitted
                            through blood or blood products.</p>
                        <p>4. It appears that the U.S. population living in Haiti is at no
                            particular risk. It would be prudent to avoid promiscuous sexual
                            behavior, illegal <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> drug use and to use
                            blood or blood products only in a life saving situation.</p>

                                >USPHS</gloss>) has reviewed reports of more than 2200 cases with a

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is a serious condition
                            characterized by a specific defect in natural immunity against disease.
                            People who suffer from <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> become
                            susceptible to a variety of rare illnesses. These illnesses are not
                            usually found in people whose immune system is normal. The two diseases
                            most commonly found in <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients
                            are pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a lung infection caused by a
                            parasite, and Kaposi’s sarcoma, a rare form of cancer or tumor of the
                            blood vessel walls.</p>
                        <p>What are its symptoms?</p>
                        <p>Many <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients do recall having
                            some symptoms before being diagnosed. Some of these early signs are
                            similar to those of many other illnesses such as cold or flu. These
                            symptoms may include fever, night sweats, swollen glands (enlarged lymph
                            nodes) in neck, armpits, or <pb facs="0050" n="4" xml:id="pg_4"/> groin,
                            unexplained weight loss, yeast infections, diarrhea, persistent coughs,
                            fatigue and loss of appetite. Anyone with prolonged, persistent symptoms
                            should consult a physician.</p>
                        <p>Why is <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> called an epidemic?</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is not like polio or measles. An
                            epidemic occurs when a disease strikes 1 percent or more of the
                            population, or when it occurs above its normal, background level.
                            Although <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> fits this definition, it
                            is not as widespread or as easy to catch as other diseases have been in
                            the past.</p>
                        <p>Who gets <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Nearly 95 percent of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases
                            have occurred in people belonging to one of four distinct groups:</p>
                        <p>• Sexually active homosexual and bisexual men with multiple sex partners.
                            This group accounts for about three-fourths of all of the reported
                            cases;</p>
                        <p>• Present or past abusers of intravenous drugs, 17 percent;</p>
                        <p>• Haitian entrants into the United States, 5 percent;</p>
                        <p>• Persons with hemophilia, 8 percent.</p>
                        <p>The PHS has examined all available information on recent Haitian entrants
                            and considers them at high risk of acquiring <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>. These risk groups have been established for medical
                            and surveillance purposes, to help in diagnosis and to track the
                            occurrence of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The failure to identify cases among the thousands of friends, relatives
                            and co-workers of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients
                            provides further assurance that routine contact offers no risk.</p>
                        <p>What causes <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Scientists have not discovered the cause of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>, but they suspect that it is caused by a virus,
                            possibly one present in the blood and/or body fluids, such as semen.
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> appears to be primarily
                            transmitted through sexual contact. The majority of cases (over 70
                            percent) have been in homosexual or bisexual men with multiple sex
                            partners.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> also has been found in intravenous
                            drug abusers, leading investigators to suspect that <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> can be transmitted by blood on
                            contaminated needles that have been shared.</p>
                        <p>The best evidence for transmission of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> is a small number of hemophilia patients receiving
                            large amounts of factor VIII, a clotting substance in blood.</p>
                        <p>Some patients cannot be placed into high-risk groups, but researchers
                            believe that most of these are linked by close physical contact to
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> victims. Some of the women
                            who have developed <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> have been
                            steady sex partners of men with <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            or men who are at high-risk for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>,
                            or they have a history of drug abuse. Children who have <pb facs="0051"
                                n="5" xml:id="pg_5"/> developed a syndrome similar to <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> may have been exposed to <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> before or during birth.</p>
                        <p>What are some theories about viruses linked to <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>No cases have been found to date where <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> has been transmitted by casual or even close daily
                            contact with <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients or persons
                            in the high-risk groups. For instance, family members other than sex
                            partners of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> victims have not
                            developed <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Ambulance drivers,
                            police, and firemen who have offered emergency assistance to <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients have not fallen ill.
                            Nurses, doctors, and health care personnel have not developed <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> from exposure to <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients.</p>
                        <p>Although other diseases may be transmitted through saliva, there is no
                            evidence that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is transmitted by
                            sweat or saliva.</p>
                        <p>However, health care providers and laboratory workers should follow
                            careful procedures when handling any blood and tissue samples from
                            patients with potentially transmissible diseases, including <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>How do persons with hemophilia get <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                            >AIDS</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Many persons with hemophilia require extensive use of factor VIII, a
                            blood product that helps blood to clot. Without effective clotting, even
                            minor cuts can cause prolonged and dangerous bleeding. For persons with
                            hemophilia, the development of factor VIII has been an important medical
                            advance.</p>
                        <p>Factor VIII is extracted and concentrated from pooled blood plasma
                            donated by thousands of people, and it appears that in some rare
                            instances the plasma has carried <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                            >AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Recently, the <gloss target="#t_FDA_1">FDA</gloss> approved a new heat
                            treatment similar to pasteurization for treating blood products such as
                            factor VIII. This procedure will reduce the likelihood that blood
                            products will be contaminated with infectious agents like hepatitis B
                            and, possibly, <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Can the hepatitis vaccine spread <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                            >AIDS</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Concern has been expressed about the safety of hepatitis B vaccine
                            (heptavax-B) because the vaccine is made from the plasma of carriers of
                            hepatitis B, many of whom may be in the same populations at high risk
                            for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. However, the procedures used
                            in the manufacture of hepatitis B vaccine are effective in inactivating
                            viruses from every known group. Therefore, the risk of vaccine-induced
                            infection by any transmissible agent that might cause <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is extremely remote, and is far
                            outweighed by the potential benefit from hepatitis B vaccine to
                            individuals at high risk for hepatitis B virus infection.</p>
                        <p>Is there a danger of contracting <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            from donating blood?</p>
                        <p>Absolutely not. Reputable blood banks and other blood collection centers
                            use sterile equipment and disposable needles. Thus, there is no chance
                            that a needle used for one blood donor would be used for another. The
                            need for blood is always acute, and people who are not <pb facs="0052"
                                n="6" xml:id="pg_6"/> in the high-risk groups are urged to continue
                            to donate blood as they have in the past. The chance of contracting
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> through a blood transfusion
                            has been estimated to be one in a million.</p>
                        <p>Is there a test for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in blood?</p>
                        <p>There is as yet no test to detect <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            in blood. Public Health Service agencies are examining blood products in
                            order to make rapid progress in developing a screening test for <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. However, a totally satisfactory
                            test may not be possible until the causative agent of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is identified.</p>
                        <p>How is <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> treated?</p>
                        <p>Some <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients with Kaposi’s
                            sarcoma are being treated experimentally with forms of interferon—a
                            virus-fighting protein produced by the body. While it has had some
                            success against Kaposi’s sarcoma, interferon treatment does not appear
                            to restore immune function. There are other treatments, such as
                            radiation, drugs, and surgery for many of the illnesses suffered by
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients. Many biomedical
                            investigators continue to work on methods for treating the specific
                            immune defects found in <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            patients.</p>
                        <p>Limited trials of a substance called interleukin–2, which scientists
                            believe may help fight the severe deficiencies seen in the immune
                            systems of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients, will begin
                            soon. Preliminary laboratory results are promising, but much more work
                            remains to be done.</p>
                        <p>Can <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> be prevented?</p>
                        <p>The Public Health Service has recommended that the following steps be
                            taken to prevent spread of this disease:</p>
                        <p>• Sexual contact should be avoided with persons known or suspected of
                            having <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>• Sexual promiscuity is a risk factor. Avoid having multiple sexual
                            partners and avoid sexual contact with others who do.</p>
                        <p>• Members of high-risk groups should refrain from donating blood.</p>
                        <p>• Physicians should order blood transfusions for patients only when
                            medically necessary. Health workers should use extreme care when
                            handling hypodermic needles.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the <gloss target="#t_FDA_1">FDA</gloss> has advised blood
                            and plasma collection centers to provide information on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> to potential donors, asking those in
                            high-risk groups to refrain from donation. Personnel have been advised
                            to learn the early warning signs of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>What is the Public Health Service doing about <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>The Public Health Service has declared <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> a top priority. The Center for Disease Control in
                            Atlanta has mobilized personnel and laboratories to establish a
                            surveillance system to conduct epidemiologic investigations in an
                            attempt to identify risk factors for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>. It also is carrying out extensive testing on blood
                            and tissue from <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> victims to find
                            the specific cause of the disease.</p>

                                >AIDS</gloss>, evaluating the natural history of the disease,
                            characterizing the immune deficiency of the patients, improving
                            treatment for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients, and
                            establishing the disease in animal models.</p>

                            regimens, investigating the underlying cause of the disorder, studying
                            the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>-associated diseases such as
                            Kaposi’s sarcoma and opportunistic infections, developing an animal
                            model for the disease, and developing a “surrogate” test for <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> that may lead to a method for
                            screening blood prior to transfusion.</p>
                        <p>In addition to new research activities on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>, many on-going basic research studies can yield
                            information about the underlying immunologic defect involved in <gloss

                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> victims.</p>
                        <p>The Food and Drug Administration is involved in several areas of research
                            with <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>. Other <gloss

                            of blood and blood products.</p>
                        <p>What is the hope for the future?</p>
                        <p>Scientific research often does not provide quick solutions to diseases as
                            complex as <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. But given the scope
                            and sophistication of current investigative efforts, there is every
                            reason to hope—and expect—that they will lead to rapid progress against
                            this devastating illness.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the preventive measures mentioned earlier can help reduce the

                        <p>1. (C) Summary: A U.S.-Belgian medical team has completed a preliminary
                            study of the auto immuno deficiency syndrome (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>) in Zaire. Their findings show a large number of
                            active cases and what the team thinks is probably the world’s highest
                            incidence of this fatal disease. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. (U) A combined Belgian-American team has just completed three weeks of
                            research on the auto immuno deficiency syndrome (<gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>) in cooperation with the Zairian
                            Ministry of Public Health. American doctors Joseph McCormick of the
                            Centers for Disease Control (<gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>),
                            Atlanta, Fred Feinson of National Institutes of Health (<gloss
                                target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>) currently serving in Cairo, and Tom
                            Quinn also of <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> working at Johns
                            Hopkins, collaborated with Drs. Piot and Thallman of the Institut de
                            Medecine Tropicale in Antwerp in this exploratory effort to determine
                            the magnitude of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> problem in
                            Zaire. The study was initiated after 44 <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> cases were confirmed among Zairians seeking treatment
                            in Belgium.</p>
                        <p>3. (U) Immediately after arrival, the team consulted the Ministry of
                            Public Health. Dr. McCormick, who has previous experience working in
                            Zaire, worked with Dr. Ruppoll of the Belgian Embassy to explain the
                            project to the Minister of Public Health and received the Minister’s
                            permission to proceed with the study.</p>
                        <p>4. (C) Findings: For the next three weeks, the team members worked
                            closely with Zairian and expatriate doctors at Kinshasa’s three major
                            hospitals. Over 30 active cases were confirmed in this period of which 6
                            resulted in the patient’s death during the three-week period.</p>
                        <p>—Based on these findings, the team estimates that <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> may be striking as many as 150 out
                            of every million Zairians annually. This figure is over twice the
                            incidence recorded in New York City which has the highest incidence in
                            the U.S.</p>
                        <pb facs="0055" n="9" xml:id="pg_9"/>
                        <p>—Unlike the U.S. where the majority of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> victims are men, Zairian victims are almost evenly
                            divided by sex. Preliminary epidemiological research shows that the
                            majority of the Zairian victims had frequent sexual contact with many
                            partners, indicating heterosexual transmission as the principal means of
                            infection.</p>
                        <p>—Cases were identified from several areas of the country, demonstrating
                            that the disease is not limited to Kinshasa.</p>
                        <p>—A significant number of the cases identified by the team occurred among
                            wealthy and prominent Zairians. It is also to be presumed that the 44
                            cases diagnosed in Belgium represent Zairians of substantial means as
                            they were able to travel to Europe for treatment.</p>
                        <p>5. (U) Training: In the course of their research, the team established
                            temporary facilities in two of Kinshasa’s hospital laboratories. Local
                            physicians were instructed in <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            diagnosis techniques and team members gave lectures at each of
                            Kinshasa’s hospitals.</p>
                        <p>6. (U) <gloss target="#t_GOZ_1">GOZ</gloss> reaction: Towards the end of
                            the project, the team members again met with the Minister of Public
                            Health. When informed of apparent magnitude of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> in Zaire, the Minister arranged a city-wide
                            conference. His alarm at the team’s findings was in marked contrast to
                            his initial feelings about <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in
                            Zaire, namely that Zaire had many other more pressing diseases requiring
                            its medical resources. The city-wide conference was well attended by the
                            medical community as well as by the media. Coverage was given to the
                            event in the next evening’s news and in Kinshasa newspapers.</p>
                        <p>7. (U) Next steps: The three-week project clearly demonstrated that a
                            serious <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> problem exists in Zaire.
                            As a result of the team’s training efforts and with the supplies left in
                            Zaire, local hospitals can now begin to diagnose and record <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases. As early as next February,
                            Dr. McCormick hopes to place a <gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>
                            epidemiologist in Zaire for more extensive studies.<note n="4"

                            months. Due to the extended incubation period of the disease, which
                            averages two years, a similar growth trend is likely in Zaire.</p>
                        <p>8. (C) Preliminary evidence shows that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> is more widespread here than in either the United
                            States or Haiti. For the following reasons, Zaire had been suspected of
                            being the birthplace of this new disease. Kaposi’s sarcoma, a rare form
                            of cancer and a fatal variety of which often appears in <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> victims, is found in its greatest
                            frequency in a non-fatal variety in eastern Zaire. Furthermore, there is
                            a connection with Haiti. After Zairian independence, a considerable
                            number of skilled Haitians were recruited to serve as doctors, teachers,
                            etc. in <pb facs="0056" n="10" xml:id="pg_10"/> Zaire. A Haitian
                            community still resides in Zaire. However, the research team found no
                            evidence to support the theory that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> began in Zaire. No immediate connection between the
                            two varieties of Kaposi’s sarcoma was found and more importantly no
                            concrete evidence was found of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in
                            Zaire prior to the time it appeared in Haiti (believed to be
                            approximately 1980). While there still may be the possibility that
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> originated in Zaire, this
                            theory remains unproven.</p>
                        <p>9. (C) Comment: We believe it likely that the Zairian <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> situation will be raised in the U.S.
                            press. Dr. McCormick informs us that in October the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Baltimore Sun</hi> considered publishing an article stating that
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> originated in Zaire. He
                            further told us that a paper on Zairian <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> victims treated in Belgium has been accepted by the
                            prestigious <hi rend="italic">New England Medical Journal</hi>. We
                            suggest that inquiries relating to <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> in Zaire be referred to <gloss target="#t_CDC_1"
                                >CDC</gloss>. If necessary, Department should point out that Zairian
                            health officials and the Zairian medical community have cooperated and
                            will continue to collaborate with American experts to understand and
                            defeat this mysterious new disease which affects both countries.</p>

                            has visited Kinshasa and reached preliminary agreement with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOZ_1">GOZ</gloss> medical authorities on a long-term

                            Action requested: Department is requested to follow up with <gloss
                                target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss> agencies; <gloss target="#t_CDC_1"
                                >CDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>, to ensure
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> efforts are properly
                            coordinated and take full account of <gloss target="#t_GOZ_1"
                                >GOZ</gloss> concerns.</p>
                        <p>2. Following up on last October’s investigative visit by US researchers
                            which first uncovered the existence of significant incidence of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in Zaire (Ref C), a combined Centers
                            for Disease Control (<gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>)–National
                            Institutes of Health (<gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>) team visited
                            Kinshasa from March 9 to 19 to establish a long-term research project on
                            the acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>) in collaboration with Zairian medical authorities.
                            The three team members were: Dr. Joseph McCormick, <gloss
                                target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>, Director, Special Pathogens Branch,
                            Dr. Jonathan Mann, <gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>’s nominee for
                            the Zaire <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> project, and Dr. Andrew
                            Vernon, <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. The team, accompanied by Embassy Science Officer, met with Dr. Kalisa
                            Ruti, Special Assistant to Minister of Public Health Dr. Tshibasu
                            Mubiay. Kalisa expressed the <gloss target="#t_GOZ_1">GOZ</gloss>’s
                            eagerness to establish U.S. public health authorities. He asked the team
                            to make appropriate contacts within the Kinshasa medical community and
                            to draft a proposal.</p>
                        <p>On March 19 Dr. Mann and Embassy Science Officer presented proposal to
                            Dr. Kalisa. Mann plans to return to Kinshasa in May to begin an
                            estimated two year tour. A <gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>
                            technician will travel to Kinshasa for temporary duty later in the
                            summer to help establish the diagnostic facilities.</p>
                        <p>4. To set the basis for the proposal, the team spent one week
                            re-establishing contacts at Kinshasa’s five hospitals and found that the
                            two major facilities—University Clinic and Mama Yemo Hospital have
                            continued to document <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases since
                            initial <gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NIH_1"
                                >NIH</gloss> visit in October 1983. The steady rate of cases
                            identified at both facilities confirms that the incidence of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in Zaire is significant. There are
                            indications that the characteristics of the disease in Zaire are
                            somewhat different from the U.S. and there is some suspicion that the
                            evolution of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in the U.S. may
                            follow Zairian patterns.</p>
                        <p>5. Diagnostic testing for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> (T-cell
                            examination) on a limited number of suspected cases is being done at a
                            University of Kinshasa laboratory by doctors from the Institute of
                            Tropical Medicine (<gloss target="#t_ITM_1">ITM</gloss>) of Antwerp,
                            Belgium. Reagents and material for the tests have been supplied by
                                <gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss> through the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>6. The team decided that the collaborative project should center on an
                            epidemiologic investigation with suitable laboratory facilities to
                            support the investigation. The Zairians are willing and able to supply
                            the clinical support necessary for the project. The team proposed that
                            two laboratories be designated to conduct diagnostic testing in
                            Kinshasa. While the first lab will continue to function at the
                            university, <pb facs="0058" n="12" xml:id="pg_12"/> Zairian doctors on
                            the university medical faculty are eager to take over responsibility for
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> research from the Belgian
                                <gloss target="#t_ITM_1">ITM</gloss> doctors performing part-time
                            diagnostic work as their time permits at the university (their principal
                            task is the study of trypanosomiosis—sleeping sickness). The second
                            laboratory will be established at Mama Yemo Hospital which will also
                            provide office space for the project.</p>
                        <p>7. This dual effort circumvents the problem of potential rivalry between
                            the University Clinic/Medical School, administered by the Department of
                            Higher Education, and Mama Yemo Hospital, administered by the Department
                            of Public Health.</p>
                        <p>8. Another potential problem which U.S. researchers must bear in mind
                            concerns the attitude and atmosphere of the project. The Zairians are
                            particularly concerned that the project be a truly collaborative venture
                            using Zairian personnel to their full capabilities with Americans
                            providing specialized knowledge, skills and equipment. Close
                            collaboration with Zairian counterparts by U.S. specialists is critical
                            to the long-term success of the project.</p>
                        <p>9. Last October’s <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> mission included
                            several Belgian specialists from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in
                            Antwerp. Embassy understands that <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>
                            is considering funding the <gloss target="#t_ITM_1">ITM</gloss> to
                            conduct a long-term clinical research project. The Zairians believe that
                            they can conduct the clinical aspects of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> research themselves and would prefer to receive direct
                            U.S. support.</p>
                        <p>10. The <gloss target="#t_GOZ_1">GOZ</gloss> is extremely concerned about
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> and is eager to work closely
                            with U.S. researchers. However, the Zairian medical community is
                            particularly sensitive about national sovereignty. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOZ_1">GOZ</gloss> has repeatedly emphasized that all
                            research must be done on a collaborative basis, i.e. with consent and
                            participation by Zairians. Zairian scientists believe that too much
                            previous scientific research has exploited Zaire as little more than a
                            convenient laboratory. For a joint research effort to be successful, it
                            is imperative that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> researchers
                            respect the sensitivities of their Zairian counterparts.</p>
                        <p>11. Embassy welcomes the beginning of the project. We have arranged to

                            collaboration by two U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) agencies, the

                            dramatically in USA patients and Zairians (whether in Belgium or Zaire).
                            Haitians may form an intermediate group. To date, Canadians, Europeans,
                            and Latin Americans appear to have the same type of risk factors as USA
                            citizens. Zaire and Haiti, therefore, appear to offer unique
                            international research opportunities. Haiti and Zaire will be prime
                            candidates for collaboration in the evaluation of anti-viral agents,
                            immune stimulating agents and vaccine candidates which will be developed

                                >NIH</gloss> research funding. This will be particularly true if

                            “different” than in USA populations. There is a particularly urgent need
                            to evaluate the true risk (if any) of heterosexual transmission of
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, which has profound
                            implications for sexually-active Americans, especially those resident in

                            with <gloss target="#t_NIAID_1">NIAID</gloss> in Tropical Medicine in
                            Haiti has been expanded since 1983, largely due to the
                            scientist-to-scientist relationships established during exchange of
                            information and collaboration on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                            >AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Let me now summarize why IMT and Belgian participation is necessary to
                            the cooperative research effort in Zaire. I shall also indicate how
                                <gloss target="#t_NIAID_1">NIAID</gloss> will manage the proposed
                            research contract. Federal Contract Law does not permit <gloss
                                target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> to award foreign research contracts
                            without the determination that there are no qualified U.S. sources and
                            that the foreign source is uniquely qualified to comply with the
                            workscope. IMT met these well-established and rigid <gloss
                                target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> scientific criteria. Under the
                            provisions of the sole-source contract currently under negotiation
                            between <gloss target="#t_NIAID_1">NIAID</gloss> and IMT, IMT staff and
                            activities will be directly supervised and continuously monitored by
                                <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> project personnel. The IMT
                            principal investigator will be required to submit quarterly reports to
                                <gloss target="#t_NIAID_1">NIAID</gloss>. This is a standard <gloss
                                target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> cost-reimbursable contract, under
                            which the contractee is paid for work already done provided <gloss
                                target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> finds it satisfactory. <gloss
                                target="#t_NIAID_1">NIAID</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NIH_1"
                                >NIH</gloss> can suspend or terminate the contract unilaterally at
                            any time.</p>
                        <p>U.S. clinicians and investigators experienced and qualified to conduct
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> research are heavily
                            committed to the domestic research effort. The chances of finding
                            Francophone Americans with these qualifications to relocate in Zaire are
                            remote. At present, no U.S. biomedical research group has an established
                            collaborative working relationship in Zaire. The pertinent unique
                            qualifications of IMT necessary for the Zairian <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> study include:</p>
                        <p>1) Long-term knowledge and experience in working with Congo/Zaire, and
                            medical archives and serum banks (dating back at least twenty years)
                            collected in the course of their long association;</p>
                        <p>2) IMT and Belgian scientists were active in investigations on Kaposi
                            Sarcoma and possible <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in Zairian
                            citizens before <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> or <gloss
                                target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss> became involved. Ninety-eight percent
                            of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases in Bel<pb
                                facs="0062" n="16" xml:id="pg_16"/>gium are Zairians, either
                            resident or those who have sought sophisticated analysis and treatment
                            heretofore unavailable in Zaire.</p>
                        <p>3) In Kinshasa, IMT has, by agreement with the government of Zaire, an
                            established laboratory which has been carrying on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> investigations independently of
                                <gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NIH_1"
                                >NIH</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to limited U.S. biomedical research experience in Zaire, U.S.
                            and Belgium have a long history of scientific exchange and cooperation.
                            For example, <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> and Belgium have an
                            agreement in principle, negotiated in 1981, to cooperate in tropical
                            medicine. This was before <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> was
                            recognized as a serious problem in either country. Belgian and U.S.
                            investigators were actively engaged in bilateral <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> research before the importance of
                            the disease in Zaire was recognized. <gloss target="#t_NIAID_1"
                                >NIAID</gloss> views the involvement of Belgian, other European, and
                            Haitian scientists in <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> research in
                            Zaire as the logical extension of our domestic and bilateral research
                            efforts in the USA, Europe, and the Caribbean.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss> research administrators and external
                            scientific consultants have determined that while there are a few
                            Zairian scientists having sufficient biomedical research training to
                            participate actively in <gloss target="#t_NIAID_1">NIAID</gloss>
                            contract research, Zairian institutions do not have the research
                            facilities, the capital for cost-reimbursable contracts, or the
                            administrative structure to provide <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>
                            with the strict fiscal accountability we require, by law. This procedure
                            will expedite the research. At the same time, we are committed to a
                            generously collaborative research effort on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> that will involve the Zaire physicians in an active
                            way.</p>
                        <p>The PHS scientists who have visited Zaire or interacted with Zairian
                            scientists in the USA or at international scientific meetings have
                            consistently been impressed by the active and productive cooperation
                            among IMT, Ministry of Health and Kinshasa University Medical Center
                            investigators. Some concrete indications of current Belgo-Zairian
                            cooperation in <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> can be cited:</p>

                            Zaire.</p>
                        <p>3) IMT has sponsored the participation of Zairian investigators in a
                            number of international meetings on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>, including the <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            meeting (Geneva, November, 1983); the International Symposium on
                            Sexually Transmitted Diseases (Montreal, June 17–20, 1984); and the
                            International Congress of Tropical Medicine and Malaria Meeting to be
                            held in Calgary in September 1984.</p>
                        <p>4) Finally, IMT and Zairian investigators have continued cooperative
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> investigations initiated
                            during the joint CDC/NIH/IMT visit to Zaire in October, 1983.</p>
                        <p>In my nine years as Director of this Institute, it has been our firm
                            tenet, in working with countries the world over, to collaborate closely
                            with national scientists. The <gloss target="#t_NIAID_1">NIAID</gloss>
                            has an enviable record, of which I am proud, of supporting rather than
                            taking advantage of foreign national collaborators. I appreciate and
                            sympathize with your concerns about our treating Zaire as an “<gloss

                            you that such would be totally inconsistent with our international
                            research policy.</p>
                        <p>In view of the national and global concerns outlined herein, I personally
                            urge and request the Embassy’s clearance for <gloss target="#t_NIAID_1"
                                >NIAID</gloss> to proceed with the IMT contract and implement the

                        <p>A newly recognized disease, termed acquired immune deficiency syndrome
                                (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>), has been increasing in
                            incidence in several parts of the world. The name <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is derived from the suppressive
                            affect on the body’s immune system by the recently discovered virus,
                            human T lymphotrophic virus or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (<gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III or <gloss target="#t_LAV_1"
                                >LAV</gloss>). This organism attacks the cells in the body that
                            protect against many parasitic, fungal and bacterial infections.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the virus has been present, and causing disease, in
                            central Africa for a number of years. About 5 years ago <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> began to appear in the homosexual
                            population in the United States. It may have been introduced directly
                            from a source in Zaire but is more likely to have passed through
                            patients in Haiti. Since that time over 10,000 cases and over 5,000
                            deaths have occurred. The number of cases is expected to double by the
                            end of 1985 and again in 1986 bringing the total number of expected
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases in the United States to
                            40,000 by the end of 1986. The incidence of the disease amongst single
                            men in the United States is, at present, 8.5 cases/100,000 people. To
                            give some perspective, the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis is about
                            13 cases/100,000 population in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The complex course of this disease is gradually becoming clear. The virus
                            is present in saliva, semen and in the blood of an infected person.
                            Sexual contact, receipt of blood products containing the virus, spread
                            to a fetus through the placenta, and exposure through intravenous drug
                            abuse have been the major means of infection in the United States.
                            Sexual spread of disease has been primarily through homosexual <pb
                                facs="0066" n="20" xml:id="pg_20"/> contact, but it is now apparent
                            that this disease is also spread through heterosexual exposure.</p>
                        <p>The disease manifests itself as:</p>
                        <p>1. An asymptomatic carrier state. The patient has antibodies to the
                                <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1"
                                >LAV</gloss> virus but has no manifestations of disease.</p>
                        <p>2. An asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic state with a measurable decrease
                            in the body’s defenses against infection.</p>
                        <p>3. A symptomatic illness with the patient developing enlarged lymph
                            nodes, decreased immunity and other symptoms.</p>
                        <p>4. The fully manifested disease with immune deficiency, development of
                            unusual types of cancers, increased susceptibility to infections with
                            uncommon organisms and an inexorably fatal course (<gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>The proportion of people who are infected with the virus and progress to
                            the rapidly fatal <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is estimated to
                            be 6 to 19. Those infected with this virus, even in its mildest form,
                            carry the organism and are apparently capable of spreading the disease
                            for long periods.</p>
                        <p>Prevention by avoidance of the common sources of infection is the most
                            effective approach to the control of this problem. Studies of disease
                            patterns indicate that the commonest means of spread is sexual and that
                            the more promiscuous a person, the greater the possibility of
                            encountering and being infected with the virus that causes <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Another source of infection in the United States has been through
                            contaminated blood products. The majority of cases of transfusion-caused
                                <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1"
                                >LAV</gloss> virus infection occurred in the period between 1979 and
                            1983. It was not yet appreciated that there was a viral cause that could
                            be spread through transfusion. In 1983 a voluntary program to encourage
                            blood donors to evaluate their risks was initiated. Donors were asked
                            not to donate if they fell into one of the high risk groups. The
                            self-deferral program has worked and the incidence of transfusion
                            transmitted infection has markedly declined.</p>
                        <p>It should be pointed out that very close interpersonal contact of any
                            sort with a person infected with <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss>
                                III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> virus may carry a risk.
                            While the definition of close contact is inexact, for the purpose of
                            defining the risk of infection with the <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1"
                                >HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> virus, it is
                            considered to be contact with the body fluids of another person. Such
                            contact may occur during sexual intimacy and “intimate” kissing. Sharing
                            personal implements such as a razor or toothbrush may provide a risk as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>High risk groups for the transmission of the <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1"
                                >HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> virus:</p>
                        <p>1. Sexually active homosexual and bisexual men with multiple sex
                            partners.</p>
                        <p>2. Present or past abusers of intravenous drugs.</p>
                        <pb facs="0067" n="21" xml:id="pg_21"/>
                        <p>3. Patients who have been transfused with blood or blood products (such
                            as hemophiliacs).</p>
                        <p>4. Sexual partners of persons with <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            or persons in groups at high risk for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> (including prostitutes).</p>
                        <p>In March of 1985 the Public Health Service licensed a new test to
                            identify the presence of antibodies to the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> virus in blood. The presence of antibodies means that
                            the person tested has been exposed to the virus. It is not yet clear
                            whether the person will develop <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            or even the extent to which he or she is infectious. The test, while
                            quite accurate, is not infallible. Three to six percent of those with
                            the viral infection will not be diagnosed by the test (false negative).
                            On the other hand, over half of the estimated one person in a hundred
                            found to have antibodies to the virus, will be shown not to have the
                            infection (false positive).</p>
                        <p>The importance of the test is that scientists can now begin to study
                            questions that remain unanswered about the virus that causes <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Until this time diagnosis only
                            occurred after the person’s immune system was destroyed. It is hoped
                            that with earlier diagnosis, it will be possible to develop treatment
                            that can prevent the destruction of the immune system and even prevent
                            infection.</p>
                        <p>Implications for the Foreign Service:</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is a worldwide phenomenon. The
                            disease has been diagnosed throughout Europe, in parts of Africa, Asia,
                            and Latin America. There is some risk of infection throughout the world,
                            particularly for those in the high risk groups outlined above.</p>
                        <p>The Office of Medical Services is monitoring the <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> situation carefully. The risk
                            factors for infection are no different for Foreign Service personnel
                            than for other people. The major manner of spread is sexual intimacy.
                            The chance of contracting the virus increases with multiple sexual
                            partners, particularly those identified to be in high risk groups. There
                            is increasing evidence that heterosexual transmission is an important
                            means of spread with obvious implications concerning prostitutes. The
                            other major risk to Foreign Service personnel and their families is
                            acquiring infection from contaminated blood products, needles, etc. In
                            this regard it should be noted that the processing of pooled blood
                            plasma for gamma globulin sterilizes that product which is, therefore,
                            safe to use. At posts at which there is a higher occurrence of the
                            infection in the local population, use of local medical and dental
                            facilities should be monitored and controlled carefully by the medical
                            staff. To provide further protection, guidelines for the use of blood
                            products for all Foreign Service personnel stationed abroad have been
                            developed and are being disseminated to the Department’s medical staff.
                            In places where blood banking follows international standards <pb
                                facs="0068" n="22" xml:id="pg_22"/> and where there is a risk of the
                                <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1"
                                >LAV</gloss> infection, blood donated for transfusion is now, or
                            soon will be, tested for the virus. In other areas it is recommended
                            that blood for emergency transfusions be obtained from members of the
                            embassy community at that location and that the donors review the
                            reasons for deferral before donating.</p>
                        <p>To assist employees and their dependents who, for any reason, are
                            concerned, the Office of Medical Services, as part of its periodic
                            examination program will test, on request, any beneficiary of the
                            Department’s health program. Such requests must be supported by the
                            recommendation of the Regional Medical Officer or the examining
                            physician. To eliminate the possibility of false positive results,
                            further testing will be arranged for any patient whose initial test is
                            positive. All results, and, indeed the testing process itself, will be
                            considered confidential medical information whose only purpose is to
                            assure that patients receive optimal care.</p>

                                III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> Positives</p>
                        <p>Individuals who demonstrate evidence of exposure to the human T
                            lymphotrophic virus or lymphadenopathy associated virus (<gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1"
                                >LAV</gloss>) as evidenced by a positive enzyme linked immunosorbent
                            assay (<gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss>) are at risk of
                            progression to symptomatic states. These states may include the fully
                            manifested disease <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> (acquired
                            immune deficiency syndrome) with all of its devastating complications,
                            or the partially manifested problem, <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> related complex (<gloss target="#t_ARC_1"
                            >ARC</gloss>). Such patients present grave management problems for the
                            Foreign Service medical program. For example, it is not in the best
                            interest of individuals or of the Foreign Service to maintain proven
                            immunocompromised people in an overseas setting where adequate follow-up
                            observation and care are unavailable. In an overseas setting these
                            patients would have greater exposure to opportunistic infections that
                            often prove fatal. The purpose of this policy is to establish basic
                            guidelines for the management of such patients.</p>
                        <p>Mandatory testing for <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss
                                target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> virus is neither desirable or
                            possible. For patients with signs and symptoms consistent with <gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1"
                                >LAV</gloss> infection, such testing is clearly indicated and
                            encouraged. For people who are concerned for any number of reasons that
                            they have a risk of infection, <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss>
                            testing is also justified. The Department <pb facs="0069" n="23"
                                xml:id="pg_23"/> will offer the test to any beneficiary of its
                            health program who desires to have it, based on the recommendation of
                            the Regional Medical Officer and/or examining physician. Because of the
                            difficulties in actual performance of the test and the expense of the
                            required equipment, the <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss>
                            (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) cannot be performed at any but a few
                            of our overseas posts. Therefore, <gloss target="#t_MMED_1"
                                >M/MED</gloss> and private laboratories in CONUS will provide most
                            of the testing resources. This testing can most conveniently be
                            performed as part of the biennial clearance examination done in
                            Washington D.C.</p>
                        <p>What course of action should be taken if someone is found to be positive
                            or has equivocal results on <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss>
                            testing?</p>
                        <p>I. Diagnosis</p>
                        <p>A. Perform the western blot assay, immunofluorescence,
                            radioimmunoprecipitation, or other confirmatory test. The choice of
                            confirmatory test will depend on availability. At present the western
                            blot assay is the preferred approach.</p>
                        <p>B. All individuals with a confirmed positive <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1"
                                >ELISA</gloss> will be returned to CONUS for further testing and
                            evaluation.</p>
                        <p>C. When confirmatory testing is positive and after consultation with the
                            patient, intimate personal contacts should be urged to undergo similar
                            testing.</p>
                        <p>II. Evaluation</p>
                        <p>A. When an individual is found to be positive by the above criteria, a
                            complete history and physical examination shall be done. Special
                            attention will be given to symptoms which might relate to progression of
                            this illness: fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia,
                            unusual lymphadenopathy, or any other symptoms or signs known to be
                            related to this disorder.</p>
                        <p>B. Further laboratory testing is recommended to establish baseline
                            immunologic status.</p>
                        <p>1. Complete blood count with differential count of WBC’s</p>
                        <p>2. Measurement of the absolute numbers of T–4 lymphocytes</p>
                        <p>3. Measurement of the T–4/T8 ratio</p>
                        <p>4. Titers for CMV, hepatitis B, E–B virus and toxoplasmosis</p>
                        <p>5. Skin testing to establish whether the patient is reactive to common
                            antigens</p>
                        <p>III. Triage</p>
                        <p>A. If a significant degree of immunoincompetence can be objectively
                            demonstrated, i.e., T–4/T–8 ratio less than 0.5 or an absolute T–4 count
                            of less than 400 cells/MM3, these individuals are at risk of
                            opportunistic infections. They should, therefore, remain in CONUS until
                            more is known about the course of <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss>
                                III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> infection or until they are
                            no longer at risk.</p>
                        <pb facs="0070" n="24" xml:id="pg_24"/>
                        <p>B. If an individual has antibodies to <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1"
                                >HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> positive, but
                            has no evidence of immunosuppression and is asymptomatic, it is
                            recommended that the individual receive counseling and then be allowed
                            to return to post.</p>
                        <p>IV. Counseling</p>
                        <p>A. The individual shall be counseled and instructed about the virus and
                            referred for treatment as required.</p>
                        <p>B. He/she will be advised:</p>
                        <p>1. Not to donate blood or plasma, sperm, body organs, or other
                            tissues.</p>
                        <p>2. To inform physicians and dentists of the positive <gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1"
                                >LAV</gloss> test.</p>
                        <p>3. To limit sexual contacts and be frank with sexual partners about steps
                            to be taken to prevent spread of the virus. Use of condoms is
                            recommended.</p>
                        <p>4. That the virus has been found in saliva and it is possible that it
                            will be spread by open mouth “french” kissing.</p>
                        <p>5. That there is no evidence that the virus can be spread through casual
                            kissing or other casual social contacts such as hugging or that contact
                            with clothing and other items cause spread of the infection.</p>
                        <p>6. That toothbrushes, razors or other personal implements should not be
                            shared.</p>
                        <p>7. If the person is a woman with a positive antibody test or the sexual
                            partner of a man with a positive antibody test, it is advisable to avoid
                            pregnancy or to postpone pregnancy until more is learned. Some infants
                            have developed <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> from their
                            infected mothers.</p>
                        <p>8. Not to receive live virus vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella,
                            yellow fever and polio vaccines.</p>
                        <p>V. Confidentiality</p>
                        <p>A. Because of the political, social, and emotionally charged nature of
                            this illness, medical confidentiality is of paramount importance. The
                            medical record should be available only to those health care providers
                            who have direct responsibility for care. A coding system by number or
                            letter to record these actual diagnoses in the record should be used
                            rather than direct language. For example, reactivity should be referred
                            to simply as <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss
                                target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> positive or <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1"
                                >HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> negative.
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> related complex would be
                                <gloss target="#t_ARC_1">ARC</gloss> with a list of the related
                            symptoms. <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> itself might be
                            identified as <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III/<gloss
                                target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> positive with a list of the
                            identifying features such as a pneumocystis or M. TB. (avian) etc.</p>
                        <p>5. Document 3—Recommendations for Screening Volunteer Emergency Blood
                            Donors When Blood is Required for Life Threatening Conditions</p>
                        <pb facs="0071" n="25" xml:id="pg_25"/>
                        <p>Background</p>
                        <p>Use of blood obtained from emergency blood donors should be considered
                            only in the rare instance when the need for blood is considered life
                            saving, e.g. severe blood loss resulting from traumatic injury, ruptured
                            ectopic pregnancy, etc., and the practices of the local blood facilities
                            are not considered adequate to ensure safety. In many instances the use
                            of blood volume expanders, i.e., crystalloides (1/6 molar lactate or
                            normal saline) and colloids (albumin) to maintain an adequate
                            circulating blood volume will preclude the need for whole blood.</p>
                        <p>Blood borne diseases can be transmitted from a blood donor to a
                            recipient. Well documented evidence exists for transmission of a variety
                            of blood borne diseases including hepatitis B, malaria, and more
                            recently the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (<gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>) caused by a retrovirus named the
                            human T-lymphotropic virus type III (<gloss target="#t_HTLV_1"
                                >HTLV</gloss> III).</p>
                        <p>Screening procedures to identify individuals at risk for transmitting
                            blood-borne disease include a careful interview for disease related risk
                            factors in the potential donor and in some instances laboratory tests to
                            detect antibodies to the disease causing agent in the donated blood.
                            Examples of the latter are the serological test for antibodies to
                            hepatitis B, syphilis and the newly developed enzyme-linked
                            immunosorbent assay (<gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss>) test for
                            antibodies to <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III. These tests
                            must be performed each time a unit of blood is donated, i.e.,
                            individuals who were seronegative on a previous test can subsequently
                            convert to a seropositive state.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations</p>
                        <p>When blood is required for life threatening conditions at overseas post
                            locations where the opportunity or capability does not exist for
                            serological screening of blood, the Office of Medical Services
                            recommends that the potential donor be carefully interviewed/examined
                            using the following guidelines:</p>
                        <p>A. Interview</p>
                        <p>Potential donors should be only those persons for whom the health unit
                            has medical records including blood group and type. These donors should
                            be provided with the following list of reasons for not giving blood.</p>
                        <p>If potential donors decide from this list that they are not an acceptable
                            donor, they need not proceed further with the interview. The following
                            groups of people are deferred:</p>
                        <p>1. Persons under 17 years of age.</p>

                            DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>The Department of State, in May 1985, implemented a series of policies to
                            deal with the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> problem.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d8fn2">See <ref target="#d7">Document 7</ref>.</note> The
                            major elements of the program are health education, a policy for
                            management of infected individuals, a policy to assure safe blood
                            transfusion services overseas, and a program to assess risk.</p>
                        <p>The Department is continually reviewing this program in light of the
                            rapid progress being made. More systematic approaches to screening our
                            population for the infection are currently being considered.</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>—Implications for the Foreign
                            Service</p>
                        <p>A. Risks</p>
                        <p>Any large organization has members of its population at risk of infection
                            from the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>) virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease
                            Control, individuals who may be considered to be at increased risk of
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> include sexually active
                            homosexual and bisexual men, recipients of blood transfusions, present
                            or past intravenous drug abusers and sexual partners of individuals at
                            increased risk for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, including
                            prostitutes. A further risk factor of unknown significance is residence
                            in areas where the disease <pb facs="0074" n="28" xml:id="pg_28"/> is
                            highly endemic. In Kinshasa, Zaire, for example, recent studies have
                            shown 4–6% of the local population to be infected with this virus. This
                            is the highest documented concentration of the infection in the world. A
                            similar high prevalence of infection has been noted in other Central
                            African countries as well as in Haiti. The implication for employees and
                            their families residing in these areas has not yet been evaluated.</p>
                        <p>II. Management of the Problem—Policy and Programs Implemented by the
                            Office of Medical Services in May 1985</p>
                        <p>A. Health Education</p>
                        <p>1. The most important and effective approach to the <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> problem is health education. All
                            employees of the Department and the 32 agencies who receive care from
                            the Department’s medical program have been provided with authoritative
                            information describing the cause and prevention of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. (Attachment A)<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d8fn3">Attachments A–C are not attached.</note> All health
                            care providers working for the Department have been instructed to brief
                            all new arrivals to posts abroad on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>, to incorporate information on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> into each post’s health handbook and
                            to provide individual and group counseling to members of high risk
                            groups. Special emphasis has been given to those serving in areas of the
                            world where infection with the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            causing virus, Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus (<gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III) is more common.</p>
                        <p>B. Medical Clearance and Treatment policies for those infected with the
                            virus were established in May 1985 and revised in September 1985
                            (Attachment B)</p>
                        <p>a. All individuals with confirmed infection with the <gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III virus will receive a limited
                            medical clearance.</p>
                        <p>1) Those with evidence of immune deficiency will not be cleared for
                            overseas assignments.</p>
                        <p>2) Those with no evidence of immune deficiency will be allowed overseas
                            assignments, but only to posts with medical facilities and experience
                            dealing with the complications of <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss>
                            III infection.</p>
                        <p>C. Blood Transfusion Policy (Attachment C)</p>
                        <p>1. A medically sound policy for the use of blood products in emergency
                            situations abroad was developed and distributed to all posts abroad.</p>
                        <p>D. Evaluation of the Risks of Foreign Service in Relation to <gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III Infection</p>
                        <p>1. Cases of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> as they occur among
                            employees and their dependents are being monitored for unusual patterns
                            of spread.</p>
                        <pb facs="0075" n="29" xml:id="pg_29"/>
                        <p>2. The Department, currently, provides <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1"
                                >HTLV</gloss> III testing to any employee, who for any reason,
                            requests it. If the test is positive, individuals whose problem was not
                            related to service are referred to their family physician for
                            confirmatory testing and counseling. Employees who became concerned in
                            the course of service abroad are provided all indicated testing to
                            confirm or rule out the <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III
                            infection. Payment for care follows accepted Foreign Service Medical
                            Program policies.</p>
                        <p>2[3]. In cooperation with the National Institutes of Health (<gloss
                                target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>) and the Centers for Disease Control
                                (<gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>), the Department has initiated
                            a voluntary research study which will evaluate the incidence of <gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III infection amongst employees and
                            families residing in an area of high prevalance.</p>
                        <p>III. Future Programs</p>
                        <p>A. Confidence in diagnostic testing has progressed since the introduction
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss> test for <gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss> III infection in March 1985. The
                            Office of Medical Services considers more systematic screening for this
                            disease inevitable and is studying several options.</p>

                            the international implications of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
                                (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>), and the tasking of <gloss

                            disease is now appearing throughout the world, and the Department should
                            be prepared to deal with its attendant problems in the political,
                            diplomatic, and public health arenas. Naturally, with such a large

                            the United States has to consider not only the requests for assistance
                            which are coming in from various governments but the real danger that
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> could be a divisive factor in
                            our bilateral relationships as countries attempt to assess blame for the

                                File, D850854–0741)</note> The problem is to show <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> as a world wide problem so as not to
                            exacerbate African nation sensitivities.</p>
                        <p>—there followed a question and brief discussion of testing protocol and
                            reliability.</p>
                        <p>b. Consular/visa issues</p>
                        <p>—the question was raised whether it is advisable to issue a travel
                            advisory on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and if so, how to
                            treat it.</p>
                        <p>—travel advisories are usually country specific none have been issued so
                            far pertaining to <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. If one is
                            issued, it would have to be worded very carefully, taking into account
                            both African nation sensitivities and US citizen response.</p>
                        <p>—if we advise State employees, shouldn’t we advise everyone? Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJD_1">Negroponte</persName> (<gloss
                                target="#t_OES_1">OES</gloss>) asked if DOS obligation as an
                            employer (to inform its employees) doesn’t extend to the citizenry as a
                            whole? Dave Lyon (<gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss>) pointed out we
                            need to be aware of the public relations aspect of any form of advisory
                            and that U.S. citizens, while aware of the disease, generally don’t
                            think of it as being passed by prostitutes/heterosexual contact.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP_1">Paul Goff</persName> (<gloss
                                target="#t_MMED_1">M/MED</gloss>) suggested the regional aspect
                            could be sidestepped by making advice to travelers world-wide. Addi<pb

                            factors could be incorporated into publications going to travel agents
                            (e.g. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, or Bureau of
                            Quarantine).</p>
                        <p>c. Political dimensions</p>
                        <p>This point was skipped over for discussion in detail. Certain propaganda
                            points will be made and uncomplimentary things will likely be in the
                            press. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should have good notions
                            of how to handle it. We do not have fact sheets on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> incidence, again due to the
                            reluctance of some nations to publicly address the issue. Ken Bart
                            suggested we rely on the <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> for our
                            information—they are apolitical and have access to information
                            unavailable to DOS.</p>
                        <p>d. Reporting Requirements</p>
                        <p>Are there capabilities to intensify surveillance and reporting on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>? Ann Rose (<gloss target="#t_HHS_1"
                                >HHS</gloss>) noted that <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> has an
                            aggressive program of lining up collaborating centers which provides a
                            mechanism to enhance surveillance.</p>
                        <p>2 &amp; 3 International Programs and Initiatives/Use of International and
                            Institutional Mechanisms</p>
                        <p>Are we satisfied with the epidemiology being done? What can be done to
                            stimulate the international community?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BNA_1">Neil Boyer</persName> (IO/T) pointed out
                            that <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> is active with an expanding
                            list of collaborating centers. It appears to him that <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> is far ahead on this issue. The
                            problem is that they have to walk a politically fine line: they can’t
                            say there are X cases in Zaire, if the <gloss target="#t_GOZ_1"
                                >GOZ</gloss> won’t officially report that.</p>
                        <p>Ann Rose (<gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>) noted that <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> lacks the infrastructure to get some
                            of this information.</p>
                        <p>Ken Bart pointed out that we can’t assist people who don’t want
                            assistance. He notes that thus far there has only been one request to
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> for assistance to another
                            country, which was turned down.</p>
                        <p>R. Kauzlerich (<gloss target="#t_IO_1">IO</gloss>) asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA_1">Neil Boyer</persName> about <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> programs on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BNA_1">Boyer</persName> said
                            there is nothing formal described, as this is in the middle of their
                            budget cycle. He expects the program structure to reflect <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> efforts at the start of their new
                            budget period in January.</p>
                        <p>Ken Bart noted that we need our own reporting as long as politics
                            interferes with other reporting mechanisms. Education, and not pointing
                            blame, should help reporting.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NJD_1">Negroponte</persName> asked R.
                            Kauzlerich how we can best get a handle on <gloss target="#t_WHO_1"
                                >WHO</gloss> activities—and an idea of how/where these should be
                            intensified? <persName corresp="#p_BNA_1">Boyer</persName> noted that
                            the lead contact with <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> in U.S. is
                                <gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>, especially through the <gloss

                        <p>Ken Bart pointed out that a major problem on the international level
                            would be the inefficiency of duplication of effort resulting from poor
                            communication among the organizations involved. He suggests that when we
                            develop a perspective on what is being done that State consider among
                            its options the role of coordinator or a ‘no-go’ option if that is
                            appropriate. A number of questions arose on how <gloss target="#t_CDC_1"

                            with other governments, e.g. Zaire), and whether NATO/CCMS involvement
                            is ‘appropriate’ or should it be directed into the <gloss

                            firm recommendation on whether to have things occur or not with U.S.
                            foreign affairs groups (e.g. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>)
                            should be developed as a part of our paper. Ken Bart countered that the
                            important thing vis-a-vis countries getting together—on whatever
                            basis—is the sharing of information and <pb facs="0085" n="39"

                        <p>1. Background: Reftel describes Department of Health and Human Services
                                (<gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>) proposal to designate <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> as a dangerous, contagious disease,
                            making it grounds for exclusion from the United States. Because <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cannot be diagnosed easily,
                            implementation of the proposed rule would mandate blood screening for
                            antibodies to the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> causing virus
                            as a part of the medical examination required of all immigrant visa
                            applicants, including refugees. A negative result from the antibody
                            screening test would be a precondition for issuance of an <pb
                                facs="0089" n="43" xml:id="pg_43"/> immigrant visa. Posts should

                            period for public comment before deciding whether to develop a final
                            rule. This, once again, must be circulated for agency comment before
                            final approval by <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss>. Estimated time,

                        <p>3. Department understands several posts have been queried by the local
                            press and offers the following guidance.</p>
                        <p>Q: Is the U.S. Government planning to institute screening of visa
                            applicants for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>A: <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is not at this time considered
                            a condition warranting exclusion from the United States on medical
                            grounds. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (<gloss
                                target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>) has proposed a rule change which
                            would designate <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> as a dangerous,
                            contagious disease, and, as such, make it grounds for exclusion from the
                            United States. The proposed rule is under review by agencies within the
                            U.S. Government. If the Government decides to publish the proposed rule,
                            there would be a sixty day period for public comment. Following the
                            comment period, if <gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss> decides to issue
                            a final rule, it would again undergo agency review before becoming
                            effective. The entire process, if carried to completion, would probably
                            take nine to twelve months.</p>
                        <p>If the proposed rule is ultimately adopted, it would have the effect of
                            adding a test for antibodies to the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>-causing virus to the medical <pb facs="0090" n="44"
                                xml:id="pg_44"/> exam already required of immigrant visa applicants.
                            Non-immigrant visa applicants would not be affected by this proposed
                            rule.</p>
                        <p>Q: What tests will be required, and what if the results are positive?</p>
                        <p>A: Presently, the simplest and most economical test is the <gloss
                                target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss> test. If this test gave a positive
                            result, and the applicant wished to pursue the application, the Western
                            Blot test would be used. A negative result on the Western Blot test,
                            following a positive <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss> test
                            result, would be sufficient for meeting the proposed <gloss
                                target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss> requirement.</p>
                        <p>Q: What if there are no facilities capable of performing antibody testing
                            in an immigrant visa applicant’s home country?</p>
                        <p>A: The absence of appropriate testing facilities in many areas, and the
                            additional inconvenience and expense to the applicant, are two of
                            several issues which have been brought to the attention of the
                            Department of Health and Human Services. Because there has been no final
                            decision to adopt this rule, we prefer not to speculate on such
                            hypothetical situations.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJC_1"
                                >Miller</persName>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I am writing with respect to the Department of Health and Human Services’
                            proposal to designate <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> as a
                            “dangerous, contagious disease”, excludable under Section 212(a)(6) of
                            the Immigration and Naturalization Act (<gloss target="#t_INA_1"
                                >INA</gloss>). For reasons stated below, the Department of State
                            urges that the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking not be published at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>While the Department of State shares <gloss target="#t_HHS_1"
                            >HHS</gloss>’ desire to protect the health of the American public, and
                            to minimize the economic costs of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> epidemic to the United States, consular posts have
                            reported that significant operational problems would arise in
                            implementing the <pb facs="0091" n="45" xml:id="pg_45"/> proposed
                                rule.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">See <ref target="#d16">Document
                                    16</ref>.</note> These relate in large part to the
                            unavailability of the <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss> and
                            Western Blot tests for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in much of
                            the world. Since the <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss> test
                            apparently gives a high proportion of false positive results, especially
                            when applied to Africans, the more expensive and still less available
                            Western Blot test would often have to be used. Moreover, relatively few
                            immigrant visas are issued by posts in areas where the incidence of
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, or of infection with the
                                <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss>–III virus, appear prevalent.
                            Thus, we question whether the relatively few seropositive individuals
                            who could be excluded under this rule justify the expense involved in
                            its implementation.</p>
                        <p>The Department also administers third-country processing of refugees from
                            such nations as the Soviet Union, Vietnam and Cambodia. Provisions would
                            have to be made, prior to adoption of the proposed rule, for the
                            disposition of any individuals who might test positively for <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> virus antibodies. It would be
                            neither realistic nor humane to return these individuals to their
                            country of origin.</p>
                        <p>Adoption of the proposed rule would also carry political risks. <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is seen in many nations as a
                            cultural threat of Western origin, and the U.S. is widely perceived as
                            the principal exporter of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            virus. Not only would the proposed rule complicate bilateral relations,
                            but it would put the U.S. in the position of contradicting the World
                            Health Organization (<gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>), which has
                            stated that there is no justification for travel restrictions at this
                            time. This could undermine the <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> program, which we are trying to
                            encourage, and also invite reciprocal measures by other nations against
                            the far greater number of American travelers.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss> and State Department officials have
                            met twice in unsuccessful attempts to resolve this issue.<note n="3"

                            This Department continues to believe that the proposed rule is in direct
                            conflict with the provisions of Section 2 of Executive Order 12291:<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d17fn4">Executive Order 12291, issued February 17,
                                1981, was created to “reduce the burdens of existing and future
                                regulations, increase agency accountability for regulatory actions,
                                provide for Presidential oversight of the regulatory process,
                                minimize duplication and conflict of regulations, and insure
                                well-reasoned regulations.” (46 <hi rend="italic">Federal
                                    Register</hi> 13193)</note> it is not based on adequate
                            information and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed benefits
                            outweigh the potential costs. A realistic cost-benefit analysis is
                            necessary before State could concur in the proposed rule. Such an
                            analysis should include: (1) the cost (and to whom) of making testing
                            facilities available at visa-issuing posts, bearing in mind the poor
                            medical infrastructure and the lack of reliable electrical power and
                            refrigeration in many areas; <pb facs="0092" n="46" xml:id="pg_46"/> (2)
                            the implications for refugee programs; (3) the administration of, and
                            possible waivers for, adjustments of the status of individuals already
                            resident in the U.S.; (4) measures to prevent the use of fraudulent test
                            results to obtain visas; and (5) consideration of the costs imposed by
                            possible reciprocal actions directed against U.S. citizens. The number
                            of individuals who would be excluded, based on data covering visa
                            issuance and estimates of prevalence of infection by the <gloss
                                target="#t_HTLV_1">HTLV</gloss>–III virus at differing visa-issuing
                            locations, could provide a reasonable estimate of the degree of
                            protection the proposed rule would afford the U.S. public.</p>
                        <p>I would also point out that clinical <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> is already excludable from the United States under
                            Sections 212(a)(7) and 212(a)(15) of the <gloss target="#t_INA_1"
                                >INA</gloss> on the grounds that an afflicted individual will be
                            unable to work, unable to pay for medical care, and therefore likely to
                            become a public charge. Confining the proposed rule to the exclusion of
                            clinical <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, as defined by the
                            Centers for Disease Control, would be medically sound and politically
                            less sensitive. Training panel physicians at visa-issuing posts to
                            recognize the sentinel diseases of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> may be much more cost-effective than use of currently
                            available antibody blood tests.</p>
                        <p>This Department therefore urges that the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
                            not be published until the concerns raised above are thoroughly
                            addressed. We are ready to pursue this matter further with you as
                                necessary.<note n="5" xml:id="d17fn5">In an undated information

                            threat since its identification in 1981. Its recognition as a new
                            disease was delayed by the absence of unique symptoms, and also by the
                            long period between infection (by the <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1"
                                >HTLV</gloss>–III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> virus) and

                        <p>This country also has the highest number of diagnosed cases of <gloss

                            distribution of blood products of U.S. origin, and the great frequency
                            of travel abroad by private citizens and military personnel, the United

                        <p>Numerous offices of the State Department have been involved in <gloss

                            years, including Medical Services, Consular Affairs, geographic bureaus
                            (especially <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss>), and <gloss
                                target="#t_OES_1">OES</gloss>. In November 1985, a Departmental

                            established—under the chairmanship of <gloss target="#t_OES_1"
                                >OES</gloss>, and with participation by <gloss target="#t_USAID_1"
                                >USAID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>. Its
                            principal objectives were to: identify and evaluate the key foreign
                            policy issues associated with <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>;
                            recommend and pursue appropriate responses by the State Department and
                            other U.S. foreign affairs agencies; and ensure proper coordination of
                            the Department’s policy and program responses, both in-house and at the
                            interagency level.</p>
                        <p>The Departmental Working Group identified at the outset three classes of
                            foreign policy objectives which required early attention:</p>
                        <p>1) protection of U.S. citizens abroad,</p>
                        <p>2) prevention and mitigation of political problems,</p>
                        <p>3) assisting governments and the international health community in
                            efforts to address the medical, public health and social problems
                            created by the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> epidemic.</p>
                        <p>The Working Group then evaluated the extent and quality of the
                            Department’s responses to date in each of these areas, and identified
                            additional measures that should be carried out to strengthen these
                            responses and to fill gaps.</p>
                        <p>The analysis and recommendations discussed in detail below can be
                            summarized in the following categories:</p>
                        <p>—promotion of international medical research on cause, prevention and
                            cure of the disease,</p>
                        <p>—expansion of epidemiological studies to learn more about cause and
                            prevalence,</p>
                        <p>—stronger public information and education campaigns to prevent panic,
                            exaggerated responses, and spread of the disease,</p>
                        <p>—promotion of measures to ensure that the world’s blood supply is
                            protected from contamination by the <gloss target="#t_HTLV_1"
                                >HTLV</gloss>–III/<gloss target="#t_LAV_1">LAV</gloss> virus,</p>
                        <p>—ensuring the adequacy of the medical capabilities of U.S. diplomatic
                            posts as well as those of host governments,</p>
                        <p>—engagement of host governments in open dialogues to prevent <gloss

                            relations problem and to facilitate the work of the health

                            To date, State/MED has initiated a comprehensive program on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> which encompasses health education,
                            safety of blood and blood products, screening of employees, counseling
                            and management of individuals who may become infected by the <gloss

                            prepared for official contractors and other temporary duty personnel.
                            This has been distributed to Embassy medical units as well as to other
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agencies which assign
                            individuals to overseas duty.</p>
                        <p>Private citizens travel abroad with great frequency. The evidence

                            many nations (particularly in the Middle East) due to its association

                            developed by the US military are preposterous. Research has never

                            are responsible for creation and dissemination of the disease. These

                            aspects of the virus in searching for possible cures or vaccines. (FYI:

                        <p>2. Background. Since October 1985, allegations that the US manufactured
                            the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>) virus as a result of biological warfare research at
                            Ft. Detrick, Maryland have appeared in more than 50 countries in media
                            of all political viewpoints, several international wire services, and
                            Soviet bloc radiobroadcasts in more than twenty languages. The
                            Soviet-inspired campaign has further engendered negative perceptions of
                            the US by alleging that the West is trying to shift responsibility for
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> to African countries and, by
                            sowing fears that the disease may be spread by US military personnel
                            overseas, exaggerating legitimate risk factors associated with the
                            virus.</p>
                        <p>3. Growing attention to the spread of the virus will present Moscow with
                            additional exploitable opportunities for the foreseable future. For
                            example, increasing local receptivity to charges that US military
                            personnel are <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> carriers could lead
                            Moscow to broaden its claims to include other Americans overseas such as
                            diplomats, students, tourists, businesspersons and Peace Corps
                            volunteers. Demands that US military bases in the Philippines be closed

                            nature of the research being conducted there; (B) describing US
                            prophylactic efforts to protect US Armed Forces personnel who are
                            deployed overseas; (C) identifying medical and scientific
                            vulnerabilities and inaccuracies, where they exist, in Soviet and
                            Soviet-sponsored information; and (D) discussing scientific and other

                        <p>The World Health Organization’s coordinator for action on the disease
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> received serious attention
                            during four days of briefings in Washington last week. Dr. Jonathan
                            Mann, a very impressive young officer of the DHHS Centers for Disease
                            Control in Atlanta, has been loaned to <gloss target="#t_WHO_1"
                                >WHO</gloss> for two years to coordinate <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> program activity.</p>
                        <p>Of particular concern in international terms is the possibility that
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> could cancel out
                            developmental progress in many of the poorer nations, especially in
                            Africa. <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is having its primary
                            impact on people aged 20–40, precisely the generation that is best
                            trained and active in trying to get countries moving economically and
                            politically. It is reported that 5 to 10 per cent of newborn children in
                            some areas may carry the virus. As those now identified as carriers of
                            the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> virus develop actual cases of
                            the debilitating and fatal disease, the costs of medical care in those
                            countries will increase dramatically. Dr. Mann told us it is essential
                            that the countries of Asia and South America, where the disease has had
                            only minimal impact, move now on prevention programs.</p>
                        <pb facs="0103" n="57" xml:id="pg_57"/>
                        <p>Dr. Mann’s visit has helped to galvanize State, <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> and DHHS officers to give more immediate attention to
                            the disease. <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> and the countries
                            involved will need substantially greater resources if they are to make
                            progress in testing, prevention, public education and other control
                            programs, and to give accelerated attention to development of a vaccine
                            and curative therapy. By 1990, <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            estimates that $1.5 billion will be needed annually for <gloss

                            to the direct bilateral assistance needed by developing countries. We
                            have been assisting Dr. Mann in making contacts with foundations and
                            other potential donors.</p>
                        <p>We believe Dr. Mann’s visit helped us to make better known the effective
                            work of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> specialized agencies, on

                        <p>3. The United States Government has long been concerned about the
                            distortions and blatant fabrications concerning the origins of the
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> virus that have appeared in
                            various forms in Soviet media. Ambassador Hartman expressed U.S. concern
                            in two letters to the editors of <hi rend="italic">Literaturnaya
                                Gazeta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sovietskaya Kultura</hi> last
                                year.<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">See <ref target="#d19">Document
                                    19</ref> and <ref target="#d19fn2">footnote 2</ref>
                                thereto.</note> As Ambassador Hartman noted, the editors of the
                            articles in question seemed ignorant even of Soviet scientists’ views on
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Leading Soviet immunologists
                            have stated that evidence indicates the disease originated in central
                            Africa, that it may be related to a similar virus found in monkeys, and
                            that it may have existed for several hundred or even several thousand
                            years, or may have evolved from another virus. This position is
                            consistent with that of the international medical and scientific
                            community that the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> virus appeared
                            first in nature and was not man-made. Moreover, there is overwhelming
                            scientific evidence that humans have been infected with the <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> virus at least since the early 1970s
                            in more than one region of the world.</p>
                        <p>4. During the last six months, the United States has welcomed recognized
                            Soviet researchers to our country to discuss <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> research with various U.S. Government health
                            officials. We have also welcomed Soviet expressions of interest in
                            cooperating on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> research expressed
                            to U.S. Government officials visiting Moscow, especially during the

                        <p>5. The United States Government welcomes continued Soviet expressions of
                            interest in combatting the worldwide spread of this dreaded disease.
                            Continuation of the Soviet disinformation campaign, however, is clearly
                            inconsistent with any joint efforts on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> research. Therefore, in the interest of making our

                                >AIDS</gloss> virus a valuable one to global health, we urge the

                            origin of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> virus. In view of
                            the unfortunate allegations that have appeared in the Soviet press, we
                            believe it would be appropriate for the Soviet Government to acknowledge
                            in public the facts concerning the origin of the <gloss

                                Peter McPherson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I have recently approved the following policy guidance on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The guidance is designed to provide missions with guidelines on which to
                            base decisions on how to respond to requests for A.I.D. support of
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>-related activities, and to
                            describe what kinds of activities will be undertaken by A.I.D.
                            regionally, centrally, and in support of the <gloss target="#t_WHO_1"
                                >WHO</gloss> Global Programme on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>. This policy will be reviewed and revised as our
                            understanding of the disease increases.</p>
                        <p>The policy guidance is reproduced in its entirety. Quote:</p>
                        <p>I. Context for Agency Policy Guidance on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss></p>
                        <p>Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>) is a relatively newly recognized and devastating
                            disease. Our knowledge about the causative agent of the disease, the
                            possibilities for its prevention and control, and the course of the
                            epidemic are changing rapidly. For these reasons and because of
                            sensitivities surrounding the disease, this policy guidance is designed
                            to be flexible. It is based on the situation now and will be revised as
                            changes in technology, knowledge, incidence and sensitivities occur.</p>
                        <p>Despite these uncertainties, an agency policy on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is important. The incidence of
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases this year is the result
                            of infection which was transmitted as long as five years ago. It is
                            imperative to tackle the problem now because infections transmitted this
                            year will result in actual <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases
                            five or more years from now.</p>
                        <pb facs="0106" n="60" xml:id="pg_60"/>
                        <p>If the course of the disease results in outbreaks of major proportion in
                            some countries as is predicted by many experts, there will be many
                            serious implications for ongoing A.I.D. programs and for development
                            prospects in those countries. Activities begun now, as outlined in the
                            following policy guidance, should be the groundwork for major efforts
                            later as they become necessary.</p>
                        <p>A.I.D. support for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> activities will
                            depend upon the particular activity and whether it could best be
                            supported by A.I.D. or another domestic or international agency;
                            availability of funding and staff; absorptive capacity in LDCS as well
                            as in donor agencies; political considerations and sensitivities; and
                            available technology and knowledge upon which to base program
                            responses.</p>
                        <p>At this point development of major bilateral efforts is constrained by
                            political sensitivities in LDCS about the disease; lack of knowledge,
                            expertise and experience in this area; inadequate financial and human
                            resources; and, finally limited absorptive capacity of LDCS. This policy
                            guidance will be reviewed and revised as knowledge and understanding of
                            the disease and its spread are accumulated.</p>
                        <p>II. Background</p>
                        <p>Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>) is an epidemic of global concern. There are currently
                            some five to ten million individuals infected worldwide. It is estimated
                            that at least 10–30 percent of infected individuals will develop <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> within five years, and an unknown
                            percent will develop the disease eventually. Once frank <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> develops it is fatal. Worldwide an
                            estimated 50 to 100 million additional people will become infected over
                            the next five years.</p>
                        <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (<gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>), the
                            cause of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, is transmitted by
                            sexual intercourse, through blood or blood products, and from mother to
                            fetus. In the United States to date the epidemic has been confined
                            largely to high risk groups including male homosexuals, intravenous drug
                            users, and hemophiliacs. In Africa and certain Caribbean and South
                            American countries <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection occur among heterosexually
                            active men and women and in their offspring. In Asia and the Near East,
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_HIV_1"
                                >HIV</gloss> infection are still rare, but both the virus and the
                            disease have recently been identified among high risk groups, indicating
                            that the disease may also become epidemic in these areas.</p>
                        <p>A number of characteristics of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            phenomenon make it a difficult problem with which to deal:</p>
                        <p>1) Its causative agent and its transmission are not completely
                            understood;</p>
                        <p>2) It is a devastating disease for which there is now no cure or
                            vaccine;</p>
                        <pb facs="0107" n="61" xml:id="pg_61"/>
                        <p>3) Its transmission is most frequently related to highly emotional and
                            private behavior, e.g. sexual relations;</p>
                        <p>4) It has been associated in particular with the U.S. and with certain
                            developing countries, and its origins and spread have been characterized
                            variously for political reasons;</p>
                        <p>5) It could become a major epidemic of the type we have not seen in this
                            century.</p>

                            sexual, and to date its incidence is often associated with either
                            homosexual practices or heterosexual prostitution. Prevention of the
                            transmission of <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection will
                            depend in large part upon changes in sexual behavior, an aspect of life
                            which is one of the most intimate, sensitive and difficult to change.
                            Educational messages will need to be very culture specific and have
                            political backing within the country. Even so, this behavior will be
                            difficult to change sufficiently to have an effect on transmission of
                            the disease.</p>
                        <p>Promotion of condom use for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            control which is appropriate and effective in the U.S. and other Western
                            countries could be construed by some as an indirect means of imposing
                            population control in countries where family planning can still be
                            somewhat sensitive.</p>
                        <p>B. Implications for other A.I.D. programs</p>
                        <p>Regardless of how the agency becomes involved in <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> programs, the disease has
                            implications for other ongoing A.I.D.-funded programs. For example,
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> may affect immunization,
                            breastfeeding, and family planning programs. In immunization programs
                            there is the possibility of transmission through unsterile needles, as
                            well as the theoretical potential for activation of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> symptoms in already infected
                            individuals by vaccines and the possibility of disseminated infections
                            following the receipt of live vaccines. The possibility of transmission
                            through breastmilk could affect A.I.D.-supported milk bank programs.
                            Increasing numbers of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases may
                            result in restrictions on international travel and training
                            opportunities.</p>
                        <p>The implications of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> for the
                            Agency’s family planning program are several. <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> prevention activities may have a positive effect on
                            family planning efforts; on the other hand, promotion of condoms for
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> prevention could create an
                            association between condoms and high risk sexual behavior (including
                            homosexual practices and prostitution). In addition, in areas where
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is widespread, it may become
                            necessary to revise recommendations on use of other forms of
                            contraceptives which do not simultaneously protect against <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>C. Long-term Impact on Development</p>
                        <p>The long-term impact of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> on
                            development is likely to be significant. The cost of dealing with <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in many countries will take funds
                            and personnel that are needed for other government programs in health,
                            family planning, education, and other priority areas, and could severely
                            jeopardize the gains made in these sectors. The deaths of significant
                            numbers of the population of productive age (e.g., from 20 to 40 years
                            old) could constrain economic productivity. The disease is already
                            present among the educated elite in a number of countries, and loss of
                            this human resource could severely damage prospects for economic
                            stability and progress. The economic and social impact of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> will in all likelihood be
                            significant for individuals, families and countries.</p>
                        <p>IV. Global <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> Efforts—the World
                            Health Organization (<gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>) Global <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> Programme</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> has taken the lead in developing and
                            coordinating international <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            programs. A special global programme for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> has been established, reporting directly to the
                            Director General. The proposed budget for this programme for 1987 is
                            about dollars 44 million. A.I.D. played an important catalytic role in
                            encouraging the formation of this programme, and in stimulating funding
                            from other member countries. Financial contributions made by A.I.D. to
                                <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> in FY 1986 were significant
                            because they were the first contributions made to the worldwide
                            programme (dollars 1 million) and to the <gloss target="#t_WHO_1"
                                >WHO</gloss> Africa Regional Programme (dollars 1 million). A.I.D.
                            will continue to support and collaborate actively with the <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> Programme.</p>
                        <p>V. Policy Guidelines</p>
                        <p>A. A.I.D. Support Mechanisms for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            Activities</p>
                        <p>1. Bilateral Activities</p>
                        <p>A.I.D. resources for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> are limited
                            because of other A.I.D. priorities, such as child survival. Staff
                            resources to deal with <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> are also
                            limited. A.I.D. health/population/nutrition and education staff are
                            already stretched in dealing with existing health, population,
                            nutrition, child survival and human resource programs. <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is still a sensitive subject in many
                            countries with political ramifications for bilateral programs aimed
                            specifically at <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> at this time,
                            although some bilateral activities are appropriate. The types of
                            bilaterally-funded activities which are appropriate are spelled out in
                            the following section outlining specific activities addressing <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Bilateral activities should
                            complement <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> programs and
                            centrally-funded activities. Many activities of interest to missions can
                            be supported through existing or emerging centrally-funded
                            mechanisms.</p>
                        <pb facs="0109" n="63" xml:id="pg_63"/>
                        <p>2. Central Activities</p>
                        <p>Central projects should complement <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            programs and bilateral health and family planning programs which may
                            include some <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> activities. Types of
                            central support also will be discussed under the next section of the
                            guidance.</p>
                        <p>Large centrally funded cooperating agencies (especially through the
                            Office of Population) may be able to carry out some activities
                            addressing <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> through their existing
                            contracts without incurring significant additional expenses. However,
                            there will undoubtedly be requests for help from these groups from LDCs
                            which will require additional funding. Cooperating agencies should
                            respond to such requests (consistent with the following guidance) if
                            this can be done without jeopardizing other priority activities or
                            without risking a backlash due to <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>
                            sensitivities.</p>
                        <p>3. Regional Activities</p>
                        <p>Regional activities should generally follow the guidelines for centrally
                            funded activities.</p>
                        <p>B. Specific Activities Addressing <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                            >AIDS</gloss></p>
                        <p>1. Research</p>
                        <p>Because <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is endemic within the
                            U.S., basic biomedical and social science research activities are
                            carried out by DHHS. The epidemic nature of the disease means that the
                            health of U.S. citizens can benefit from international research,
                            including collaborative epidemiologic, serologic, and virologic studies
                            in different settings. As a result, <gloss target="#t_CDC_1"
                            >CDC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>, and <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, have undertaken studies in Africa and
                            elsewhere. <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>’s programme includes
                            epidemiological research. While U.S. efforts overseas should be
                            undertaken in a coordinated fashion, A.I.D. is not the appropriate
                            agency to coordinate these efforts since they are beyond the scope of
                            U.S. foreign assistance or are being undertaken by <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Biomedical Research</p>
                        <p>Biomedical research, such as development of vaccines and drugs, is of
                            interest to and can be undertaken by private sector firms and is being
                            undertaken by other parts of the U.S. Government and therefore should
                            not be undertaken by A.I.D.</p>
                        <p>Epidemiological and Behavioral Research</p>
                        <p>Both epidemiological research to determine the pattern of infection and
                            disease, and behavioral or anthropological research to determine the
                            implications of changing the behavior which is associated with the
                            transmission of the disease are important.</p>
                        <p>Epidemiological research is being undertaken by <gloss target="#t_WHO_1"
                                >WHO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agencies and
                            national researchers. A.I.D. will not undertake research which can be
                            funded by other <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agencies, other
                            donors or <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb facs="0110" n="64" xml:id="pg_64"/>
                        <p>Where A.I.D. has expertise and experience the agency could support
                            behavioral or anthropological research into the particular practices and
                            their contexts, in order to provide information on how these practices
                            may be changed. This research may be supported bilaterally or
                            centrally.</p>
                        <p>Operations Research</p>
                        <p>Operations research can help determine, for example, under what
                            circumstances an <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> health
                            communication effort using mass media is feasible; whether family
                            planning workers are effective sources of information about <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> control; and, whether it is possible
                            to change sexual practices through the media, health worker training and
                            availability of spermicides or other viricidal agents. Operations
                            research can improve our understanding of the circumstances in which
                            existing family planning programs might be constructively linked with
                            prevention of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, or on the other
                            hand might be adversely affected by being linked to an <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> campaign. A.I.D. has considerable
                            experience in operations research, particularly as part of our
                            population and health programs, and should support these efforts where
                            appropriate bilaterally or centrally. Operations research can also
                            explore the role of public health communications in reducing risk due to
                            other means of transmission.</p>
                        <p>Economic Research</p>
                        <p>Because of the serious implications of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> for development and especially for A.I.D. programs,
                            A.I.D. will support research on the longer-term development and economic
                            effects of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> epidemic through
                            central or bilateral mechanisms. This includes the potential impact on
                            health budgets, economic productivity, child survival, and other
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>2. Information Exchange</p>
                        <p>Many unknowns, uncertainties and sensitivities about <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> and the speed with which it has
                            spread make sharing and exchange of information between scientists,
                            politicians, and development workers critical. There is a danger of
                            inadvertent as well as deliberate misinformation about <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and steps are being taken through
                                <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> and other channels to correct
                            such information. <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> has the primary
                            role in coordinating and disseminating information and A.I.D. will
                            support <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> in this area.</p>
                        <p>A.I.D./Washington will provide information to missions on a regular basis
                            so that A.I.D. field staff is fully informed with the latest information
                            on the disease and worldwide activities addressing it.</p>
                        <p>A.I.D. may join other donors or agencies in supporting international
                            meetings and we may support participation of <gloss target="#t_LDC_1"
                                >LDC</gloss> representatives, but we will not directly and solely
                            sponsor international meetings or <pb facs="0111" n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                            /> clearing houses on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. A.I.D. may
                            support efforts to compile and disseminate reliable technical
                            information on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Training</p>
                        <p>Information, education and training about how to deal with prevention and
                            control of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> are very important.
                            Training can include in-country training in the context of ongoing
                            health and population programs; participant training, including study
                            tours; and funding for attendance at international meetings on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Mission or central funds may be
                            used to support study tours or participation in meetings on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. In-country service worker training
                            or retraining should probably be mission funded.</p>
                        <p>In some cases with very little additional resource input, A.I.D. could
                            become more actively involved in health and family planning worker
                            training on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. A.I.D. centrally
                            funded contractors have already begun and will continue to include
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> information in training
                            curricula for health and family planning workers.</p>
                        <p>Information and education about the transmission by skin piercing
                            instruments should be built into training components of A.I.D.-funded
                            immunization programs.</p>
                        <p>4. Public Health Education</p>
                        <p>Public health education methods, including social marketing techniques,
                            aimed at preventing transmission of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> is critical since there is no cure for the disease at
                            this time. Given the poorly understood nature of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> and its potential for
                            misunderstanding, we need to be sure we have the right message(s), and
                            that the media are used sensitively with proper attention to cultural
                            and other factors, particularly in regard to communications dealing with
                            sexual transmission. The <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> Global
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> Programme includes a
                            component on education for prevention of transmission. A.I.D. will
                            support and collaborate with this <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            activity. Several developing countries have already begun public
                            education campaigns about the risk behaviors which are associated with
                            transmission of the infection. A.I.D. support for education about
                            prevention of sexual transmission will emphasize the importance of
                            sexual abstinence or long term stable relationships. Assistance for
                            education efforts and distribution of prophylactics against transmission
                            will be based on the cultural and religious norms of the countries being
                            assisted.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. has considerable experience in social marketing of
                            contraceptives and with other health promotion modalities which could be
                            useful in developing campaigns to prevent <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>. Use of condoms will play a role, but will not be the
                            only behavioral change indicated. However, behavioral changes to prevent
                            particularly sexual transmission of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> differ from those required for other health or family
                                <pb facs="0112" n="66" xml:id="pg_66"/> planning behaviors, and we
                            do not yet know which messages about <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> will be effective in particular situations and with
                            different target groups. Moreover, information and education used in the
                            U.S. about <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> does not translate
                            easily to developing countries.</p>
                        <p>Before we become directly involved in free-standing <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> information, education and
                            communication (IE&amp;C) efforts we need to answer some critical
                            questions through social science and operations research and to ensure
                            that host countries really want our help. Initially, A.I.D. support for
                            IE&amp;C efforts should be approached through operations research
                            projects and through the <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> program.
                            Direct bilateral support for free-standing communications programs for
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> prevention may be appropriate
                            in the future.</p>
                        <p>5. Prevention of Sexual Transmission</p>
                        <p>In addition to support for operations research on public health education
                            aimed at preventing sexual transmission of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>, A.I.D. will procure and provide condoms for <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> prevention programs on request.
                            Condoms will be procured through the existing central procurement
                            mechanism, which is a buy-in project. If there is substantial demand for
                            additional condoms, funding will probably need to come from both
                            bilateral and central sources. A.I.D. may also assist in procurement of
                            condoms for <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> on a reimbursable
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>6. Prevention of Blood Transmission</p>
                        <p>Blood screening programs are an important means of preventing
                            transmission of the virus through blood transfusions. The <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> programme includes support for
                            development of these programs, and <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            has already provided equipment and supplies for such programs to some
                            countries. A.I.D. will support <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            efforts to prevent blood transmission of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>. A.I.D. will also fund the purchase of equipment and
                            supplies for blood screening programs on request and where funds are
                            available (and where <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> funding is not
                            available), keeping in mind the recurrent cost implications of blood
                            screening programs, including costs for reagents, and the need for host
                            countries to plan for this continued expense.</p>
                        <p>The cost of reagents for blood screening may decrease as new,
                            technologically appropriate diagnostic tests become available. If
                            private firms are not interested in developing diagnostic tests for
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> markets, A.I.D. may need to
                            support adaptation of diagnostic tests to make them technologically
                            appropriate for LDCS and may need to facilitate their distribution.</p>
                        <p>7. Prevention of Perinatal Transmission</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> will support efforts to reduce
                            perinatal transmission of <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>. This may
                            involve counseling of infected women not to have children and the option
                            of abortion for infected pregnant women. A.I.D.’s prior<pb facs="0113"
                                n="67" xml:id="pg_67"/>ity on child survival makes perinatal
                            transmission a real concern. The need to counsel women and men who wish
                            to become parents about the risks of passing on the infection to their
                            offspring may arise within the context of A.I.D. MCH and family planning
                            programs. However, A.I.D. will not support any involvement in any
                            activities that include abortion.</p>
                        <p>8. Vaccination Efforts</p>
                        <p>As previously stated, A.I.D. will not fund vaccine research and
                            development efforts. Due to the sensitivities of setting up vaccine
                            testing sites in LDCs and disputes over data between researchers, A.I.D.
                            should let <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> take the lead in this
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Should a vaccine become available, A.I.D. will consider supporting
                            procurement of vaccines and immunization materials and the
                            implementation of vaccination programs.</p>
                        <p>9. Care for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> Cases</p>
                        <p>Under the Agency health policy, A.I.D. does not generally support
                            curative health care. In the case of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> there are currently no known therapeutic agents for
                                <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection.</p>
                        <p>A.I.D. will support <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> efforts to
                            reduce the impact of <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection on
                            individuals, groups and society.</p>
                        <p>C. Implications for Other A.I.D. Programs</p>
                        <p>In addition to support for some activities to address <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, A.I.D. must be concerned about and
                            monitor the implications of the disease and its prevention and control
                            for other A.I.D. programs. <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            concerns affecting on-going A.I.D. programs include: immunization,
                            breastfeeding, and family planning activities. A.I.D. Missions should
                            monitor these areas closely. A.I.D./Washington will develop further
                            guidance if necessary.</p>
                        <p>1. Immunization Programs</p>
                        <p>Although there are no known cases in which the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> virus has been transmitted through immunization
                            programs, use of unsterile needles and syringes has been documented to
                            result in transmission. Even if immunization programs do not transmit
                            the virus, it is possible that use of unsterile implements could
                            transmit <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>. Even if this means of
                            transmission is not in fact a viable means of spread, associations may
                            be made between use of unsterile implements in A.I.D.-funded vaccination
                            programs and incidence of disease. For these reasons, caution must be
                            taken to ensure use of sterile equipment. A.I.D. is following the <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> guidance which recommends against use
                            of disposable needles because they cannot be sterilized and are often
                            reused. Use of reusable needles and care about their sterilization is
                            the recommended procedure. All A.I.D.-funded immunization programs
                            should make certain that adequate supplies of reusable needles and
                            syringes are <pb facs="0114" n="68" xml:id="pg_68"/> available, that
                            adequate sterilizing equipment is in use, and that upgraded training is
                            provided for health workers to ensure use of sterile implements.</p>
                        <p>A.I.D. will continue to follow <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            guidelines on immunization of all children and pregnant women in spite
                            of the theoretical potential for activation of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> symptoms in already infected individuals by vaccines
                            and the possibility of disseminated infections following the receipt of
                            live vaccines. As long as the threat of immunizable diseases to the
                            health of children in LDCs remains higher than the threat of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_WHO_1"
                                >WHO</gloss> guidelines will be followed by A.I.D.</p>
                        <p>2. Breastfeeding Programs</p>
                        <p>There is no convincing evidence that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> has been spread through breastmilk, yet there is the
                            possibility that the virus could be transmitted in this way. It is
                            important that A.I.D. Missions be aware of this potential and of the
                            possibility that association could be drawn between confirmed pediatric
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> cases and this mode of
                            transmission if found, new guidance on promotion of breastfeeding and
                            milk banks will be issued.</p>
                        <p>3. Family Planning</p>
                        <p>The family planning community has a number of advantages that can be
                            brought to bear on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> prevention. It
                            has a strong <gloss target="#t_PVO_1">PVO</gloss> infrastructure which
                            is now in place and in large measure eager to undertake <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> prevention activity. It also has
                            experience reaching the reproductive age group with somewhat similar
                            services. There is also significant commonality between means used to
                            interrupt the transmission of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                            >AIDS</gloss>—including promotion of monogamy, abstinence, condom and
                            spermicide/viricide use—and methods used to space births.</p>
                        <p>On the negative side, there is legitimate concern that the association of
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> with condoms could result in
                            a stigma for condoms which family planning organizations have spent
                            years and substantial resources to counteract. Similarly, there is a
                            potential stigma for family planning organizations more generally,
                            particularly if activities are targeted toward high risk groups such as
                            prostitutes or drug users.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, there is the clear potential dilemma both for individuals and
                            programs regarding condom use versus other effective contraceptive
                            methods. Without clear confidence that a couple is monogamous and that
                            neither partner is infected, there may be a compelling argument for
                            condom use. While condom use and the use of other methods are not
                            mutually exclusive, this may pose a significant operational problem. It
                            is anticipated that most or all of these issues regarding potential
                            effects on family planning will be addressed through operations
                            research.</p>

                        <p>The World Health Organization (<gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>)
                            estimates that between 5–10 million people in every region of the world
                            are currently infected with <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. The
                            enormity of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> pandemic is just
                            now beginning to be realized. While most American attention has
                            naturally been focussed on our own situation and that in Western Europe,
                            a far greater calamity is unfolding in a swath of a half-dozen countries
                            across central Africa, including several important and influential
                            friends and allies, such as Zaire, Zambia, and Tanzania. It is difficult
                            to overstate the impact on these societies of the likely loss of much of
                            their modern sectors, but that is precisely what a number of them are
                            facing. The problem is made more intractable by African defensiveness
                            and unwillingness to face up to it, and by Soviet-generated allegations
                            that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> originated in U.S. germ
                            warfare experiments. For the U.S., there are important policy questions
                            that need urgently to be addressed. Can we stimulate African leaders to
                            quickly take necessary steps to retard a further spread of the disease?
                            What is our role in a humanitarian crisis brought on by a disease that
                            is both incurable and invariably fatal? Does it make sense to continue
                            to support economic development efforts and technical and military
                            training programs in countries that may be doomed to social and economic
                            collapse in the near term? If not, how should our assistance be
                            refocussed? We will have further comments from our ongoing study of this
                            rapidly developing situation. This “heads-up” is intended to signal the
                            magnitude of the problem and some of its implications for US
                            interests.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>It is hard to be sure of the extent of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> in Africa. <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>
                            estimates, which are based on what they get from Africa’s rudimentary
                            public <pb facs="0116" n="70" xml:id="pg_70"/> health and statistical
                            services, appear grossly to understate the problem. But data we are now
                            receiving from private researchers in touch with some of our African
                            posts suggest that <hi rend="italic">up to one-third of all adults in
                                many urban areas</hi> of Central and East Africa <hi rend="italic"
                                >may now be infected with <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss></hi>.</p>
                        <p>Throughout Africa, men and women are infected in equal proportions.
                            Although in the West, infection rates tend to be highly-concentrated
                            among specific groups (in the US, approximately 90% of all <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> patients are either homosexuals,
                                <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> drug users, or both), the disease
                            is much less so highly-defined in Africa. Fairly
                            uniformly-characteristic of the disease in most African countries,
                            however, is that its incidence seems to be highest among young
                            sexually-active professionals—those with education, wealth and power and
                            those in close contact with them—the post-independence elites and their
                            associates—politicians, civil servants, businessmen and women, soldiers,
                            intellectuals, transport workers, and prostitutes. The evidence so far
                            suggests that among such African elites the rate of infection is <hi
                                rend="italic">at least double</hi> that of the general urban
                            population.</p>
                        <p>In Dar es Salaam the infection rate (those showing antibodies for <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> virus) among the <hi rend="italic"
                                >general</hi> urban population is reportedly 34%; in Lusaka 27%; in
                            Rwanda’s capital of Kigali, 31%; in Kampala, an almost astonishing 54%.
                            The general rate of infection approaches 10–15% along major transport
                            routes out of these cities. Peasant farmers, with less wherewithal for
                            promiscuous sexual activity, seem to be less infected (but at rates
                            which are still double or more those in the U.S.).</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> was discovered only this decade,
                            and we are just now beginning to be able to predict mortality rates. The
                            most recent clinical studies in the advanced countries of the West
                            suggest that <hi rend="italic">as many as 50%</hi> of those who test
                            seropositive for <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> (i.e., who
                            evidence the tragically useless antibodies generated by the body’s
                            immune system once it has been invaded by the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> virus) <hi rend="italic">will die within five
                                years</hi>. 75% will die within seven. After ten years, the data
                            agree, death rates begin to approach 100%. Mortality rates during the
                            earlier periods of infection are higher still in countries that do not
                            have modern public health systems and medical facilities. As the gradual
                            collapse of the body’s immune system proceeds, those with <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> become more and more vulnerable to
                            other diseases that are endemic in Africa, such as malaria and
                            tuberculosis.</p>
                        <p>What this means, unless our data are fundamentally wrong, is that <hi
                                rend="italic">by the mid-1990s two-thirds or more of the modern,
                                educated elite and perhaps half the overall urban population</hi> in
                            highly infected countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda,
                            Zaire and Zambia <hi rend="italic">will probably have died</hi>.</p>
                        <p>We have little historical experience with death rates of this magnitude.
                            At the dawn of the Christian era, China’s urban population was <pb
                                facs="0117" n="71" xml:id="pg_71"/> cut by four-fifths as the result
                            of an outbreak of bubonic plague. In the XIVth century, Europe lost
                            two-thirds of its population to the “black death.” The result in each
                            case was a collapse of organized society and its economy accompanied by
                            a paroxysm of religious fanaticism and xenophobia. Historians speculate
                            that classical Mayan civilization may have been shattered by a similarly
                            catastrophic outbreak of disease.</p>
                        <p>So far, <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> has been discussed by the
                            world—including by Africans—primarily as a problem of medical research
                            and public health. Clearly, it has implications that transcend either.
                            In Africa, <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> has
                                the potential to devastate entire societies</hi>, erasing the
                            hundred year-old impact of modern European technology and thrusting
                            whole nations back into the early iron age.</p>
                        <p>Despite a growing awareness of the threat in the most seriously affected
                            African countries (Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has lost one son to
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>; another is dying from it),
                            debate in Africa has tended to center on whether or not <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> originated in Africa. Most African
                            governments have sought to conceal the dimensions of the problem from
                            both foreigners and their own populations. (There are some exceptions:
                            Rwanda and Uganda have faced up to the problem with massive campaigns of
                            public education and condom distribution; “love carefully.”) Africans
                            are resentful of speculation that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            may have originated on their continent, and of current scientific
                            linkages to types of “green monkey virus”. The Soviets have fed this
                            resentment with deliberately and assiduously-spread disinformation
                            campaigns insinuating that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> may
                            have originated with alleged US military biological/bacteriological
                            warfare experiments at Ft. Detrick, Maryland. But there is now no point
                            in debating where <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> came from; the
                            relevant question is where it is likely to take us, and <hi
                                rend="italic">what we can do about it</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the matter of our response to the horrifying humanitarian
                            crisis that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> now seems about to
                            visit upon Africa, numerous other policy issues need urgently to be
                            addressed. We need to deal with these carefully, but study them rapidly
                            and without “wasting time” studying them:</p>
                        <p>—how do we help persuade African governments to abandon their present
                            head-in-the-sand mentality, declining even to discuss the situation,
                            denying known facts, refusing to provide information or statistics?</p>
                        <p>—and a corollary to this—how do we deal with African suspicions, fed to a
                            degree by the Soviets, that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is a
                            “white man’s creation” developed by the West in order to keep Africa
                            permanently weak—and the corresponding (albeit still relatively

                        <p>We are in the process of gathering as much information as we can about
                            the expected impact of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> on African
                            societies: <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> has asked each of its
                            posts to prepare an analysis of the degree to which <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is present, and its expected toll on
                            the leadership structures (political, economic, commercial, academic,
                            social) in each country. We are disseminating as much information as we
                            can to the field. We plan to sponsor a series of symposia in the
                            Department, convening recognized authorities on both the disease and its
                            likely impact on African societies.</p>
                        <p>For the time being, we believe it is important to recognize both the
                            magnitude and impact of the problem as well as the limitations on what
                            we can do. It is, we believe, imperative that the U.S. not give the
                            impression that we can—through a massive “task force” approach to the
                            problem, deal with it by hurling resources into the void. Over the next
                            couple of weeks, we will be considering various options for US action,
                            including specifically demarches, directly or through intermediaries,
                            intended to awaken African awareness to the imperative of <pb

                            further spread of the disease. We will also be reviewing the
                            implications of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> problem for

                            testing for immigrants and aliens. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJC_1"
                                >Whitehead</persName> expressed State Department concerns that it is
                            not so much the foreign policy aspects of testing as the practical
                            aspects, such as cost and the thought that only a small number of people
                            will be intercepted. He pointed out the complications in doing a blood
                            test in a foreign country since facilities are not often suited to doing
                                <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> tests. Mr. Bauer pointed out
                            that it wouldn’t take many immigrant <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"

                            tests. Mr. Bauer said the Justice Department favors testing of

                            he believed that the practical problems could be worked out.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HJS_1">Herrington</persName> said that we

                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> would be appropriate. Mr. Bauer
                            reiterated support for adding <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> to
                            the list of dangerous diseases because of the cost of health care for

                            questioned whether the money for testing immigrants and aliens would be

                        <p><gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is now the 10th leading cause of
                            lost years of life in the country and is rapidly becoming the leading
                            cause of death for males ages 20 to 39. As of May 1987, approximately
                            35,000 cases of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> have been
                            reported and more than 20,000 <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                            >AIDS</gloss>-related deaths have occurred.</p>
                        <p>Accurate <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> tests are widely available,
                            but since <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> itself is always fatal,
                            there continues to be concern about confidentiality and discrimination
                            against individuals who test positive for the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1"
                                >HIV</gloss> virus. However, public health practices have always
                            dictated that in order to control an infectious disease spread by direct
                            person-to-person contact, every effort must be made to limit the
                            encounters between those who are infected and those who are
                            susceptible.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">DISCUSSION</hi>—In February 1987, the Centers for
                            Disease Control (<gloss target="#t_CDC_1">CDC</gloss>) sponsored a
                            conference in Atlanta on the role of testing in the prevention and
                            control of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Although no final
                            agreement was reached, there was a consensus that more testing should be
                            done.</p>
                        <p>The public is also very concerned about <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>, as news of the epidemic continues to be reported. In
                            a <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>/ABC Poll, conducted in March
                            1987, 98% of all those polled believed a test for the <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> antibody should be available for
                            everyone. 83% believed physicians should check for <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> on all routine examinations, and 85%
                            believed testing should be required for all people about to be married.
                            Many health professionals believe that counseling should be required
                            whenever a person tests positive or negative for <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. The <pb facs="0122" n="76"
                                xml:id="pg_76"/> cost of this counseling is estimated to range from
                            $22 to more than $100 per person.</p>
                        <p>The screening test for the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> antibody
                            costs less than $1.00; however, a confirmatory test is always performed
                            to eliminate false positives. After two positive <gloss
                                target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss> tests, a further check is done
                            using the Western blot test. With the incidence of the <gloss

                            higher for tests conducted in the private sector. Some claim that there

                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> tests. However, this claim lies only
                            against the <gloss target="#t_ELISA_1">ELISA</gloss> tests and not the
                            complete multi-stage testing procedure.</p>
                        <p>A new test is being developed by a laboratory in Cambridge,
                            Massachusetts, that would be similar to the home pregnancy test and
                            would be nearly 100% accurate. The Army is currently using this test on
                            an experimental basis. <gloss target="#t_FDA_1">FDA</gloss> is
                            considering this test, and it may be approved within the next year or

                        <p>There are various ways in which <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>
                            tests can be administered. In <hi rend="italic">self-initiated
                                tests</hi>, an individual could voluntarily request an <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> test from his physician or any medical
                            clinic. <hi rend="italic">Routine/voluntary tests</hi> are done when a
                            health care provider routinely recommends testing on the basis of
                            information provided by a patient who may have an increased likelihood
                            of <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection. In this case, the
                            individual understands that the test is strictly voluntary. <hi
                                rend="italic">Routine/required testing</hi> could be done where
                            individuals are in high risk groups, in prison, donating blood, organs
                            or tissues, or using the services of a sexually transmitted disease
                            clinic (<gloss target="#t_STD_1">STD</gloss>) or drug abuse clinics.
                            There has also been concern expressed by some about the possibility of
                            “mandatory” testing where individuals in the general population would be
                            identified, sought out, and required to be tested.</p>
                        <p>All <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infected individuals are
                            potentially infectious, and since most, if not all, infected persons can

                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> antibody screening), it is important
                            to consider ways in which wider testing can be done, consistent with
                            established public health procedures that protect confidentiality. These
                            tests could be self-initiated, routine/voluntary, or
                            routine/required.</p>

                        <p>The President opened the meeting and turned to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName>, who briefly reviewed the <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> issues. Mr. Bauer provided
                            background about <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> testing,
                            pointing out that we are faced with a major problem in testing for the
                                <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> virus. He indicated that, with
                            respect to other <pb facs="0124" n="78" xml:id="pg_78"/> contagious
                            diseases, testing is a standard Public Health Service practice, and
                            national surveys have shown a fair amount of public support for the
                            testing of individuals for the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>
                            virus. The President observed that we already have laws at the local
                            level which require testing individuals for contagious diseases, and
                            wanted to know why the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> virus
                            couldn’t be added to the list of communicable diseases. Mr. Bauer
                            responded that this is one of the recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDP_1">Hodel</persName> suggested an
                            epidemiological probe to determine the incidence of <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> in America. The Council agreed to move
                            forward with the study. On the issue of whether <gloss target="#t_HIV_1"
                                >HIV</gloss> testing should be done for aliens and immigrants,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> said the
                            problem is not with the principle of testing, but rather with the
                            implementation of testing and the fact that it would be done in other
                            countries without the sterile medical practices we have in the U.S. He
                            said that quality control is important. The President asked about the
                            distinction between the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> virus and
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Mr. Windom explained that
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is the final stage of the
                                <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> virus can lie dormant for years before
                            the symptoms are apparent.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1">Weinberger</persName> described
                            the Department of Defense program used to test for the <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> virus and said, based on their
                            experience, there are ways to do the testing if we decide to go forward
                            with this policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                            said that before we issue a rule, we need to know what to do. Surgeon
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KCE_1">Koop</persName> said that 37
                            nations now have reported the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>
                            infection. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAI_1">Burns</persName> offered
                            that while there are practical problems, we could do the testing in the
                            United States if necessary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCW_1"
                                >Weinberger</persName> said he could see no insurmountable problems
                            to testing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CTK_1">Cribb</persName> stated
                            that there would be a comment period before the rule is made final
                            anyway, which would allow time for an implementation plan to be
                            developed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJR_2">Wright</persName> stated
                            that a final rule on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> testing is
                            ready to be released and he believed it is possible to work out the
                            differences in placing the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> virus on
                            the list of dangerous contagious diseases. Secretary <persName

                        <p>2. As posts are aware, we have had a continuing problem with Soviet
                            disinformation about <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>—in
                            particular, the insinuation through articles disseminated/reprinted in
                            the media, alleging that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            originated with U.S. military biological experiments.</p>
                        <p>3. Although posts have been provided with factual data and information to

                            might be helpful for you to know that the matter came up in the recent

                            was a pressing international health challenge which we all must meet.
                            But, <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName> added, we also see
                            continuing Soviet disinformation efforts that seek to link <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> with alleged U.S. research on
                            biological weapons. <persName corresp="#p_CCA_1">Crocker</persName>
                            asked directly how <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Adamishin</persName>, as
                            the senior Soviet official directly charged with Africa policy,
                            explained the continuing obvious Soviet disinformation propaganda
                            campaign on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Adamishin</persName> replied that the
                            Soviets had only relatively recently begun to understand the magnitude
                            of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> problem, and supported
                            international efforts to deal with it. He said that the U.S. and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> should work together on the
                            problem, and that the Soviets might develop some ideas for bilateral
                            cooperation. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Adamishin</persName> said he
                            had “no difficulty” in admitting that Soviet propaganda on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> had been “foolish”. He claimed that
                            the Soviet press was now publishing fewer items of this kind. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Adamishin</persName> asserted, however, that the
                            U.S. media had also sometimes engaged in the same sort of
                            “disinformation”, citing U.S. media reporting of the 1979 Sverdlovsk
                            anthrax outbreak caused by an accident at a Soviet biological weapons
                            research facility.</p>

                        <p>6. While Dept does not believe <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            officials should publicize <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Adamishin</persName>’s comment by itself, U.S. officials should not
                            hesitate—in the context of your everyday working discussions with host
                            government officials, media representatives, and others—to use <persName

                            “foolishness” of the Soviet campaign, and the clear implication that it
                            was false disinformation, in rebutting any assertions about alleged U.S.
                            responsibility for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> that may come

                        </opener>
                        <p>As you know, our Departments have been working closely with the Centers
                            for Disease Control over the last two months to ensure the timely and
                            effective implementation of the President’s decision that all persons
                            coming to the United States for permanent resettlement should be tested
                            for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection. I am today sending to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BOR_1">Bowen</persName> the Department
                            of State’s comments on the proposed <gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>
                            rule designating <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> as a contagious
                            disease that was published in the <hi rend="italic">Federal

                        <p>In reviewing our comments, you will see that we have concluded that
                            proper implementation of the proposed <gloss target="#t_HHS_1"
                                >HHS</gloss> rule will require close coordination between <gloss
                                target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss>, Justice, and State
                            and—importantly—changes in certain immigration laws and regulations. I
                            would particularly like to call your attention to and ask your support
                            for four initiatives that we believe must be undertaken to ensure that
                            the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> testing program can be
                            implemented in a manner consistent with our domestic <pb facs="0128"
                                n="82" xml:id="pg_82"/> and foreign policy interests, especially as
                            they relate to immigrant visa applicants with close ties to the United
                            States and to that very vulnerable population for which I know you share
                            my concern—refugees.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, we believe that the Administration must seek legislative
                            authority to waive the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> exclusion
                            for immigrants in appropriate circumstances, such as when a spouse or
                            child of a U.S. citizen is involved. We also believe that special
                            arrangements with respect to <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>
                            testing of refugees must be made. Under our proposal, refugees will in
                            virtually all instances be tested for <gloss target="#t_HIV_1"
                                >HIV</gloss> before they are brought to the United States. In two
                            situations, however, it may be necessary to defer testing until the
                            refugee has arrived in the United States: these would be emergency,
                            life-threatening situations where the refugee must be moved to the
                            United States before the test can be done, and situations in which
                            testing facilities are unavailable and it is determined to be in the
                            national interest that <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> testing be
                            deferred until the port of entry. Finally, we consider it of utmost
                            importance that your authority to waive a Section 212(a) (6) exclusion
                            based on <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection for a refugee be
                            retained and used in a responsible yet flexible way consistent with
                            Section 207(c) (3)<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">Section 207 of the <gloss

                            on the <gloss target="#t_HHS_1">HHS</gloss> proposed rule. Various

                        <p>1. (U) At the request of Secretary of Health Bengzon, representatives
                            from Clark, Subic, the Embassy
                            and DFA met with a number of Department of Health officials on August 10
                            to discuss <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Clark AB was represented by CABCOM
                            Col. Go, 13th <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> General Snyder, Col.
                            Haydon, Col. <persName corresp="#p_RAP_1">Rosenberg</persName>, Major
                            Boyd and Capt. Gustin. Subic representatives included SUBCOM General
                            Tadiar and PolMilOff Capt. Atwell. Consul General Krieg and PolMilOff
                            Martin attended from the Em-bassy. Olongapo and Angeles City health
                            officials were also present as was Melba Lim from DFA’s American
                            Desk.</p>
                        <p>2. (U) The briefing began with an update of the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1"
                                >GOP</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> antibody test
                            program (through July 30, 1987). Over 58,000 tests were administered, 90
                            percent to prostitutes and 1.5 percent to homosexuals. 66 percent of the
                            tests administered to prostitutes (several individuals were tested more
                            than once) were in the Olongapo/Angeles area. 46 out of 50 individuals
                            who tested seropositive were prostitutes (40 in Olongapo and Angeles)
                            while 3 were homosexuals. (Comment: We note that the incidence of
                            infections therefore were .086 percent for prostitutes and .34 percent
                            for gays.)</p>
                        <p>3. (U) The briefer then addressed what needed to be done, including
                            rehabilitation/support for infected individuals, a better education
                            campaign, distribution of condoms and the provision of statistics on
                            screening and “contacts” of US servicemen on the bases. He concluded
                            that major efforts needed to be made, some with government funding but
                            most at the local level.</p>
                        <p>4. (U) In the discussion that followed, General Tadiar said the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>’s Department of Health should move
                            quickly on its own to establish a program of care and alternate
                            employment for infected prostitutes while the problem was still small
                            and manageable rather than trying to get others to fund it. He was
                            concerned that infected individuals were still working as hospitality
                            girls and increasing the risk of further spread of <gloss

                        <p>5. (U) Representatives from the U.S. facilities reiterated <gloss

                            testing positive. They added that specific figures on the number of
                            individuals involved could not be released due to Privacy Act and <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> policy considerations. In response to
                            a query, U.S. reps agreed to obtain information regarding testing of
                            civilian workers at the bases.</p>
                        <p>6. (U) Secretary Bengzon said that the issue is not merely a public
                            health problem but a social problem with political overtones due to the
                            number of infected individuals near the bases. Bengzon believed the
                            health problem was being handled adequately but that more work was
                            needed on the social/political aspects. He wondered whether alternate
                            employment could be found since the girls were in the business for the
                            money and similar wages were unlikely elsewhere. He said a
                            rehabilitation program would be a bottomless pit. He felt the solution
                            to the public health aspect of the issue was resolution socially and
                            politically within the local community where the problem is encountered.
                            He added that unless the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> problem
                            is addressed, there will be reverberations elsewhere. He said people
                            from the bases are involved (in causing the problem) and so must be part
                            of the solution, perhaps showing concern by contributing to its
                            resolution. He concluded by saying the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1"
                                >GOP</gloss> is looking for a way to resettle those who tested
                            positive, but the program lacks funding.</p>
                        <p>7. (C) Comment: It was apparent from the meeting and the focus of the
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> testing program that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> is concentrating on the
                            prostitute population outside the bases rather than the gay community
                            which is large and active. The <gloss target="#t_DOH_1">DOH</gloss>
                            officials did concede that all seven active <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> cases in the country were “imported” by Filipinos
                            returning from abroad or foreigners (not AmCits) living here. Consul
                            General Krieg expressed concern to Secretary Bengzon after the meeting
                            that if the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> was seriously concerned
                            about the health threat, it ought to shift more focus to the homosexual
                            and addict communities where experience has shown the disease to be most
                            prevalent.</p>
                        <p>8. (C) We expect pressure to continue for a U.S. financial role in the
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> program. We will
                            continue to be responsive to Bengzon’s constructive views. <gloss

                        <p>2. Begin summary: The last issue discussed during the <persName

                                >Sukhodrev</persName> talks on August 26 was the question of Soviet
                            disinformation, beginning with its effect on bilateral cooperation in
                            the field of health. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName>
                            commented first on the complicated nature of US–<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> cooperation in health, remarking
                            that the U.S. side is pleased to note that our bilateral cooperation is
                            expanding into areas with great potential benefits for the international
                            medical community. He then identified the political problems that have
                            prevented greater cooperation, delivering a detailed and forceful
                            description of the specific disinformation campaigns that serve as an
                            obstacle to mutually beneficial efforts. <persName corresp="#p_SVM_1"
                                >Sukhodrev</persName>’s response was limited to repeated claims that
                            Soviet media are no longer subject to government control and simply
                            repeat allegations made by the foreign press. <persName
                                corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> said this response was
                            unsatisfactory: Either Sukodrev’s claims are untrue, or, if true, they
                            suggest widespread anti-American feeling among Soviet editors and other
                            officials, among whom he singled out <hi rend="italic">Novosti</hi> head
                            Valentin Falin. End summary.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> made it clear that the
                            U.S. would simply not be able to engage in otherwise potentially useful
                            cooperation on <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> research with the
                            Soviets as long as Soviet media continue to publish scurrilous and
                            completely unacceptable allegations about the origin of <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. While expressing appreciation for
                            recent Soviet efforts to halt the spread of the deadly disease, and
                            acknowledging the publication of numerous articles by responsible Soviet
                            scientists pointing to the natural origin of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName>
                            remarked that the U.S. deeply regrets the concerted disinformation
                            campaign and the resulting politicization of the <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> crisis. In his initial response,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SVM_1">Sukhodrev</persName> described his
                            pleasure with the fact that U.S. officials had noticed the many articles
                            by responsible Soviet experts, and described recent Soviet Government
                            efforts to stop the spread of the disease, including a new law on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> announced <pb facs="0132" n="86"

                            septel). In confronting our allegations about a concerted <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> disinformation campaign, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SVM_1">Sukhodrev</persName> denied that such a campaign
                            exists and claimed that the stories did not originate in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> but had simply been picked up from
                            the foreign press and reprinted in the Soviet Union. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SVM_1">Sukhodrev</persName> elaborated his position by
                            commenting on the current lack of control over the press, which he
                            claimed is now free to publish almost anything it desires, and blamed
                            the presence of anti-American <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            articles on a newly-developed thirst for sensationalism in Soviet media.
                            In an attempt to prove his point, <persName corresp="#p_SVM_1"
                                >Sukhodrev</persName> cited the existence of real debate on
                            political and economic issues between leading publications like <hi
                                rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ogonek</hi>, and
                            criticisms of <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> articles not only in other
                            media but also in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> itself.</p>
                        <p>4. At this point the pace picked up considerably as <persName
                                corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> delivered a detailed,
                            point-by-point presentation on Soviet disinformation efforts to date.
                            The following specific cases were discussed in a frank and forceful
                            manner:</p>
                        <p>—The publication of 32 separate articles (by U.S. count) in the Soviet
                            press blaming U.S. biological warfare experiments for the creation of
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> from January through August
                            8, 1987 alone.</p>
                        <p>—The publication of allegations that the U.S. had deliberately microwaved
                            British protesters at the Greenham Commons Military Facility, resulting
                            in hair loss, fainting and miscarriages.</p>
                        <p>—The publication of a book by the Soviet Ministry of Justice alleging
                            that the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was behind the murder of
                            former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and the slaughter of more than
                            900 American citizens in Jonestown, Guyana.</p>
                        <p>—The printing of allegations that U.S. citizens are adopting Latin
                            American children in order to use their body parts for transplant
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>—Allegations that the U.S. has developed an ethnic bomb that only affects
                            non-whites, including one by CPSU CC candidate member and <hi
                                rend="italic">Novosti</hi> Director Valentin Falin in a June
                            interview reported by <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi>. (<persName
                                corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> asked if Falin was out of

                            jocularly that this was why he was no longer at the <gloss

                        <p>5. At various points during <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"
                                >Simons</persName>’ presentation, <persName corresp="#p_SVM_1"
                                >Sukhodrev</persName> further elaborated his defense of the Soviet
                            postion. In short, <persName corresp="#p_SVM_1">Sukhodrev</persName>
                            attempted to convince the U.S. delegation that, under Glasnost, there is
                            simply no way to prevent the Soviet press from reprinting foreign
                            allegations about U.S. activities. He claimed that Soviet editors now
                            have the freedom and responsibility to print what they choose, with no

                            /> When faced with evidence that official Soviet individuals (like
                            Falin) and institutions (like the Ministry of Justice) had been involved
                            in the disinformation campaign, <persName corresp="#p_SVM_1"
                                >Sukhodrev</persName> was unable to counter effectively and simply
                            expressed doubt about the accuracy of <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"
                                >Simons</persName>’ information or attempted to blame incidents on
                            specific individuals. As a general form of rebuttal, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SVM_1">Sukhodrev</persName> alleged that the Soviet side
                            could easily draw up an even thicker dossier of negative reporting on
                            the Soviet Union by the United States, implying that the Soviets had
                            long suffered such abuse together with official U.S. comments on the
                            freedom of the press, and that now the U.S. would simply have to get
                            used to the degree of freedom currently enjoyed by the Soviet press.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> politely but firmly
                            rejected <persName corresp="#p_SVM_1">Sukhodrev</persName>’s claim that
                            the Soviet disinformation campaign could be attributed to a free press,
                            and reminded the Soviet delegation of the serious damage such activities
                            can cause. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1">Simons</persName> also remarked
                            that, if the publication of inflammatory allegations on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> does not represent a
                            government-orchestrated disinformation campaign, then it most surely
                            reflects a strong anti-American feeling on the part of Soviet editors
                            and other officials, contrary to longstanding Soviet denial that
                            anti-Americanism exists here. <persName corresp="#p_STW_1"
                                >Simons</persName> urged the Soviets to take a more constructive
                            position on this issue, suggesting that the Soviet Union follow the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> practice of issuing official
                            denials and/or corrections in response to the publication of inaccurate
                            information in the U.S. press. He referred in particular to the natural
                            origin of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SVM_1">Sukhodrev</persName> responded by repeating his
                            earlier position, focusing on the need for the U.S. to understand the
                            new freedoms of the Soviet press.</p>
                        <p>7. Despite obduracy, the Soviet delegation took careful notes throughout
                            the exchange.</p>

                        <p>It is evident that US policymakers are becoming increasingly interested

                                >AIDS</gloss> and that more and more hard facts are being uncovered
                            by the state officers and intelligence collectors. <gloss

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWJ_1">William Walsh</persName>, the
                            Commission’s economic and international advisor, gave an overview of the

                            rough figures on the incidence of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                            worldwide but said that “basically we don’t know what’s going on,” as
                            data from the World Health Organization are grossly inadequate. He
                            stressed that for its international analysis, the Commission will depend
                            heavily upon information developed by the Intelligence Community.</p>

                                n="89" xml:id="pg_89"/> towards a vaccine is slow, complicated by
                            the fact that the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> viruses mutate so
                            quickly. No immediate breakthroughs are expected. Even if a presumedly
                            effective vaccine were discovered tomorrow, it would take several years
                            of testing to prove that it worked. Then it would take several more
                            years to produce and distribute it. Therefore, an effective vaccine
                            probably is not possible before the mid-1990s; for the foreseeable
                            future, the only barriers to the spread of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> are those already known.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets are performing research too, but we have no indication that

                            the main research centers, and international cooperation is

                        <p>Dr. Houston Dewey (<gloss target="#t_AFMIC_1">AFMIC</gloss>) said that
                            little is known about the extent of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> infection in the Soviet military. It is clear,
                            however, that <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is considered to be
                            a problem in the military, particularly since in the entire Soviet
                            population of at least 50,000 or 60,000 are believed to be infected. Dr.
                            Dewey believes that blood infection is the most likely means of
                            spreading <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in the Soviet military
                            because (a) their medical hygiene is so primitive and (b) their soldiers
                            are permitted relatively little freedom when they are in foreign
                            countries.</p>

                                >AIDS</gloss> is a problem in their country.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d34fn3">See <ref target="#d30">Document 30</ref>.</note>
                            Their recognition of this problem was underscored by the recent adoption
                            of a series of measures to combat the disease. While not all details
                            appear clear, a harsh law passed in August provides for a five-year jail
                            sentence for anyone (including foreigners) who have the virus and have
                            sexual contact with another person even if the infection is not passed
                            on. The same legislation allows for an eight-year jail term for those
                            who knowingly transmit the disease. Suspect carriers can be forcibly
                            tested and hospitalized. Soviet domestic media also is urging Soviet
                            citizens to limit their contact with foreigners, particular Americans
                            and Africans. Foreign students who test positive are either prevented
                            from coming to study in the Soviet Union or are being sent home.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union’s disinformation campaign has had remarkable success in
                            some parts of the Third World in blaming the inception of <pb

                            Soviet officials now state they want to cooperate with the United States
                            in combating <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and as a condition
                            for that cooperation the United States has demanded that the campaign of
                            disinformation be halted. There are some indications that <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> disinformation themes are fading in
                            the Soviet press. But it will be hard to determine whether their
                            sophisticated worldwide campaign “stops,” because the story has already
                            taken root in some Third World countries and continues to change in
                            content.</p>

                            Cuba’s official position to the realities that are becoming known. The
                            Cuban government says only four (!) Cubans have contracted <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, all of whom have died, that 143
                            other Cubans have tested <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> positive,
                            and that 114 foreigners have been sent home. In fact, Cuba intends to
                            test its entire population by the end of 1989; and of the first 800,000
                            tested it is reported that 5,400 tested <gloss target="#t_HIV_1"
                                >HIV</gloss> positive. At least 1,900 foreigners, mainly African
                            students and military trainees, have been deported. The number of deaths
                            is probably in the hundreds and growing.</p>
                        <p>Castro has taken severe measures, vowing to rid Cuba of <gloss

                            liberties. Cubans testing positive are reportedly quarantined for life.
                            One source has claimed that infected Cuban soldiers in Africa are not
                            brought home. Cuba is spending $10 million of its scant foreign reserves
                            (10 percent of its hard-currency health budget) on the fight against
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Castro has attempted to blame Cuban <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> infection on the United States, but it is widely known

                            <p>In August 1987 the Politburo adopted a series of dramatic measures
                                against Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (<gloss
                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>) and thereby acknowledged the
                                existence of an <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> problem in
                                the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. While the possibility of
                                    <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> has been minimized for
                                several years, intelligence reporting revealed serious concerns
                                among Soviet scientists as early as mid-1985 and confidential
                                estimates of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> infection are
                                much larger than the hundred cases officially admitted to date.
                                Fighting <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> may cause the regime
                                considerable political embarrassment because it highlights
                                deficiencies in the health care system and requires discussing
                                unmentionable realities of Soviet life such as homosexuality and
                                prostitution. Fighting <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> will
                                also be costly economically because it will force the regime to
                                correct the massive problems of the health care system. These
                                deficiencies include inability to test all blood transfusions and
                                the vulnerability of spreading <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                    >AIDS</gloss> through the use of reusable hypodermic needles.
                                The regime has set out to determine the exact extent of <gloss
                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> through massive testing,
                                including mandatory testing of high risk groups. Additional
                                definitive information on the disease should be circulating within
                                the Soviet and world scientific communities. [<hi rend="italic"

                                Yugoslavia. Data on this subject is important to provide early

                                its large population, and its food and refugee problems that spill
                                over into neighboring countries make the monitoring of the
                                epidemiological aspects of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                                important from the standpoint of the disease’s effects on
                                neighboring countries as well as on US interests in Ethiopia. While
                                Ethiopia officially reports a low incidence of <gloss
                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> at the present time, Ethiopians
                                abroad have been found to have the virus, and its social
                                disorganization, due to civil war and famine, threaten to cause
                                conditions conducive to a rapid spread of disease. [<hi

                            <p>There is not much information for Somalia, Sudan, and Djibouti,
                                although their geographic locations, large refugee populations, and
                                insurgencies and dissident activity suggest their populations are
                                probably heavily infected. Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, and
                                Zambia are reporting relatively high incidences of the disease and
                                probably have significant portions of their populations infected.

                            <p>US concerns over Chad’s war with Libya and Libyan efforts to support

                                domestic food shortages and refugee movements, are the principal
                                reasons for the selection of Chad for a high rating in this group of
                                countries. While Chad’s reported incidence of <gloss

                                of the war and food shortages, and the return of refugees from

                            <p>Nigeria’s high rating is due to its regional importance in western

                                populations are small, because of the great potential for the

                            <p>For the Central and Southern Africa Region we assigned high priority
                                to South Africa. South Africa is of concern to US political and
                                economic interests, and has great importance for the political,
                                economic, and military interests of neighboring countries. In this
                                regard, South Africa has offered to assist neighboring countries in
                                assessing the spread and incidence of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                    >AIDS</gloss> through survey and monitoring teams sent to those
                                countries, and testing of blood samples sent to South Africa.
                                Although the incidence of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                                among white South Africans follows the western pattern and is openly
                                reported, the spread and incidence among its black population and
                                among its foreign labor force is not nearly as well known. We
                                believe South Africa may become the depository of intelligence on
                                the epidemiological aspects of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                    >AIDS</gloss> for neighboring states through its assistance
                                activities, and through its monitoring of the foreign labor force it
                                could be gathering the intelligence necessary to warn of future
                                problems in the home countries of the foreign workers. [<hi

                            <p>Angola, Mozambique, and Zaire were also assigned relatively high
                                ratings. Angola and Mozambique were selected because of their
                                importance to US interests—and because their active insurgencies,
                                severe food and social problems, and geographic location are
                                conducive to <pb facs="0146" n="100" xml:id="pg_100"/> the rapid
                                spread of the virus, despite the small number of cases officially
                                reported. Adjacent countries have reported high infection and
                                incidence rates, harbor large numbers of Angolan and Mozambican
                                refugees, and have active, though informal, trade and tribal
                                contacts across borders. Moreover, Cuba apparently suspects that
                                some cases of infection have been contracted by their troops while
                                stationed in Angola. We believe countries that have active
                                insurgencies and resulting social disruption are creating conditions
                                that favor the spread and incidence of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                    >AIDS</gloss> and should be monitored closely. As for Zaire, its
                                large population is already heavily infected. Major international
                                research organizations are based in Zaire and may produce early and
                                important intelligence relating to the epidemiological aspects of
                                    <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> for all of Africa. [<hi

                            <p>Burundi, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe have relatively high incidence of the
                                disease. Information on each of these countries became available
                                early in the epidemic, and following up on this body of data may
                                yield important intelligence for understanding the epidemiological
                                aspects of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in other

                                While the Castro regime claims that the incidence of <gloss

                                sources indicate that the government is greatly understating the
                                problem largely to prevent the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"

                                for Castro’s African adventures. While the current levels of
                                bilateral business, tourism, and immigration are small, since Castro
                                seized power in 1959 more Cubans have immigrated to the United
                                States than any other single nationality, and a new wave of Cuban
                                immigrants is possible should Castro decide to loosen emigration

                            <p>Haiti and the Dominican Republic were included in this group
                                principally because of their high incidence of the disease and the

                                States and those countries. As reported by the World Health
                                Organization, in Haiti, the absolute number of <gloss

                                the population are among the highest in the world. For the Dominican
                                Republic, the number of reported <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                    >AIDS</gloss> cases is substantially smaller than for Haiti, but
                                still among the highest in Latin America. For its part, however, the
                                bilateral contacts between the United States and the Dominican
                                Republic are very high. During the 1980s, more Dominicans have
                                immigrated to the United States than any other nationality. Mexico
                                was included because of its high incidence of <gloss

                                number of cases among Latin American countries), because of its
                                enormous social and economic exchange with the United States, and
                                because of the strategic importance Mexico plays in US international
                                considerations. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                            <p>The prevalence of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is, as yet,
                                undetermined or vastly under reported in most Near Eastern
                                countries. These countries, however, are unlikely to remain free of
                                    <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection or disease. The
                                above priorities reflect the need for information on the incidence
                                and impact of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> in these
                                countries. The lack of surveillance and diagnostic capability in
                                both rural and urban areas contribute to the statistical morass.
                                Only a few states have the health care or public health systems with
                                resources adequate for mounting effective programs to cope with
                                    <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> or to reduce <gloss
                                    target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> transmissions. The Council of Arab
                                Health Ministers recently established a committee to draft
                                legislation on means to combat <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                    >AIDS</gloss> in the Arab world. [<hi rend="italic">portion

                            <p>High risk groups in the region are probably similar to other
                                countries with cases of <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>.
                                While the sharing of contaminated needles by intravenous drug
                                abusers is a major factor in the spread of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> virus in the West, injectable
                                heroin HCL is relatively uncommon in the region and, where
                                available, expensive. The expense will place the urban elite drug
                                abuser—who is typically more affluent and mobile <pb facs="0150"
                                    n="104" xml:id="pg_104"/> than his fellow countrymen—at a
                                greater risk of contracting <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>
                                through this means. As government attempts to cope with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> threat, the US and other Western
                                countries will probably be asked for assistance. [<hi rend="italic"

                            <p>Urban elites, because of affluence, mobility, and lifestyle, probably
                                have a disproportionate risk of infection. The extent of the disease
                                in rural areas, however, may not be recognized because of the lack
                                of reliable testing. While most Arab states have reported cases of
                                    <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, officials in some
                                countries—such as Algeria, Western Sahara, Syria, Libya—are often
                                unable to conduct sophisticated study of the disease itself or on
                                the cases that have occurred so far. <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                    >AIDS</gloss> testing kits are not available in sufficient
                                quantities, and there is no reliable capability to test for <gloss
                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Screening of blood
                                supplies—particularly in Syria and Morocco—is insufficient, placing
                                those who require blood transfusions at higher risk of contracting
                                    <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>. Israel, Jordan, and
                                Egypt are taking steps to establish national health measures to
                                screen blood supplies and to educate the public on <gloss
                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                    >AIDS</gloss> prevention. Tunisia, on the other hand, is aware
                                of the <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> threat, but is trying
                                to down play the problem lest it have a negative impact on tourism.
                                Relatively little is known about the extent of <gloss

                                    >AIDS</gloss> in the Arab world. Many of the states—such as
                                Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Bahrain, Oman, and the UAE—are increasingly
                                concerned with testing foreign residents and some are considering
                                requiring <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>-free certificates
                                before issuing work permits. Several cases of <gloss

                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> virus have been reported in

                                low due to the inadequate hospital care and other health resources.

                                among its resident citizens. The few identified cases have been in
                                foreign visitors, or in Chinese returning from residence abroad or
                                associating closely with foreigners. The Chinese Government,
                                however, is taking the threat quite seriously and hopes to block
                                importation of the disease by comprehensive testing of foreign
                                visitors and other preventive measures. The task of excluding <gloss
                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> is made more difficult because
                                of the primitive status of China’s health care system; the presence
                                of the infection in Taiwan, Thailand, and Hong Kong; and extensive
                                encounters with foreigners both in China and abroad. Xenophobia,
                                already significant, will be intensified if <gloss

                                    >AIDS</gloss> because of high rates of other sexually

                                rights could be threatened by strong anti-Americanism. The Republic
                                of Korea is in a similar posture. Both nations are exhibiting
                                increased signs of nationalism. Proponents find the <gloss
                                    target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> issue a popular rallying point.
                                Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are cooperating with the W.H.O.
                                program against <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and they are

                                treatment. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam have provided little

                            al.</p>
                        <p>The authors used a case-control methodology to compare <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infected prostitutes to prostitutes
                            not infected with <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>. The authors need
                            to clarify whether there were any differences between cases and controls
                            with respect to age. If, for example, the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1"
                                >HIV</gloss> infected prostitutes were older than the non-infected
                            prostitutes, this age difference could possibly account for increased
                            exposure potential to <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> among the
                            older prostitutes. The cases, if older, may have had more sexual
                            partners than the controls prior to becoming prostitutes.</p>
                        <p>The overall prevalence rate needs to be better defined (p. 6). The
                            denominator should be the number of prostitutes tested during a
                            specified period and not the number of tests. Another helpful piece of
                            information would be the inclusion of the approximate percent of
                            prostitutes tested by region. Were various regions under or over
                            sampled? If Regions II, IV, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII were
                            undersampled, this might account for the negative findings.<note n="3"

                        <p>The authors report that 93% of the infected prostitutes were working in
                            areas adjacent to military bases (p. 7). This is a comparison of
                            numerator data only and is misleading. The Region VI rate is the same as
                            that adjacent to the military bases, but the authors offer no
                            explanation for this.</p>
                        <p>A brief explanation of the matching ratio would be helpful (61 controls:
                            34 cases—why not 1:1 or 2:1?).</p>
                        <p>Some comments on the reliability of the subjective data are also
                            necessary. For example, are there other data to support the reports by
                            the prostitutes that there is no <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> drug
                            use among them? If no data <pb facs="0154" n="108" xml:id="pg_108"/> are
                            available, some comment needs to be made with reference to <gloss
                                target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> drug use in the Philippines. No reader
                            will be naive enough to believe Philippine prostitutes do not or never
                            did use <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> drugs without some supporting
                            data or frame of reference.</p>
                        <p>The authors comment that blood transfusion experience was similar among
                            cases and controls. Is blood screened for the presence of antibody to
                                <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>? Were there differences between
                            cases and controls for indications for transfusion (e.g. were more
                            illegal abortions done in cases than controls?)?</p>
                        <p>The conclusions in the discussion section are not totally supported by
                            the data presented by the authors. Without better data on <gloss
                                target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> drug use, the assertion that
                            transmission is by heterosexual intercourse is tenuous. Without better
                            information on the age of the prostitutes and mobility of the
                            prostitutes (i.e. are prostitutes brought to areas around military bases
                            from other geographic regions?, could they have been infected
                            elsewhere?), allusions to U.S. servicemen as a primary source of
                            infection are not well founded.</p>
                        <p>The paper presents data that need to be published. The conclusions should
                            be based on the data. As the paper now reads, that is not the case. I
                            would suggest some changes as I have outlined to insure a fair
                            representation of the data.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">The article was

                        <p>In his memorandum of August 5, 1988 to the Secretary of State, the
                            President directed the development of a three-year plan for
                            international efforts against human immunodeficiency virus (<gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>) infection, with emphasis on
                            less-developed countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">A copy is in
                                Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                P880041–2108.</note> The attached action plan summarizes the current
                            international efforts by federal Departments and Agencies against the
                                <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> pandemic and presents the
                            strategy and plan for their programs for the period FY 1989–1991.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> pandemic continues to grow
                            rapidly. At present, 142 countries report 124,114 cases of the acquired
                            immunodeficiency syndrome (<gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>)
                            worldwide. The <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> case count,
                            however, represents only a fraction of the extent of <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection and is also subject to
                            substantial under-reporting, particularly in the infrastructure-poor
                            developing world.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection is transmitted in only
                            three ways: through sexual activity, by the exchange of blood or blood
                            products, or perinatally from mother to child. Worldwide, the dominant
                            mode of transmission is through sexual activity.</p>
                        <p>The extent of <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection in many
                            parts of the world and the potential for further spread make control and
                            treatment of infection and related disease a major public policy
                            challenge in many developing countries. The potential implications for
                            the economic and political stability of these countries, their internal
                            security, and regional security, make the control of <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection an important foreign policy
                            issue for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Given the extent of infection and modes of transmission, a worldwide
                            effort will be required to control the further spread of infection.
                            Because of the exceptional public and private sensitivity of human
                            sexuality in all societies, programs to control the spread of infection
                            will require extraordinary social, cultural, and political specificity.
                            These factors require that policy leadership in the worldwide effort be
                            given to an organization such as the World Health Organization (<gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>), which has the capacity to interact
                            effectively on international health <pb facs="0156" n="110"
                                xml:id="pg_110"/> issues and can provide the framework for effective
                            multilateral and bilateral coordination.</p>
                        <p>The modes of <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> transmission and the
                            current level of technology dictate that control of the spread of
                            infection will largely depend on changes in sexual behavior. At present,
                            there is no vaccine to protect against infection and no treatment for
                            those who are infected to prevent them from infecting others.
                            Furthermore, there is at present no cure for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> or other <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>-related
                            disease, and the limited methods of treatment available are only
                            partially effective and very costly.</p>
                        <p>The principal program tools for eliciting voluntary changes in the
                            behavior of those at risk of transmitting the infection are information
                            and education. These must be targeted to those at risk and specific to
                            their social, cultural, and political environment. There are encouraging
                            signs that behavior will change when those at risk understand the full
                            extent of the risks and the methods for avoiding them. However, the
                            process of changing behavior will, even under the best of conditions, be
                            slow.</p>
                        <p>The urgent need for <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> prevention and
                            control worldwide demands the development of better tools. Of highest
                            priority for research are a better understanding of the process of
                            behavior change, an affordable, heat-stable vaccine against <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> infection, and affordable treatment
                            regimens that prevent <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> transmission
                            and development of disease, and, ideally, eliminate infection.
                            Successful development and testing of these tools will depend on
                            international collaboration.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. has committed itself internationally to support the <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss> Global Programme on <gloss
                                target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_WHOGPA_1"
                                >WHO/GPA</gloss>) in its planning and coordination of programs to
                            control the spread of <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> and to
                            coordinate the research needed to eventually eliminate infection. The
                                <gloss target="#t_WHOGPA_1">WHO/GPA</gloss> has moved quickly and
                            effectively to develop global and country-specific plans and expects to
                            have put them into place in all cooperating countries within the next
                            three years. Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_WHOGPA_1">WHO/GPA</gloss>
                            plan for the period from 1989 to 1991 is the framework for U.S.
                            participation in the worldwide effort. The three-year action plan by
                            federal Departments and Agencies outlines program implementation within
                            that framework.</p>
                        <p>U.S. government actions against the <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>
                            pandemic must be well-coordinated internally and internationally with
                            those of the <gloss target="#t_WHOGPA_1">WHO/GPA</gloss> and with those
                            of other donor and recipient countries. Coordination mechanisms are in
                            place and are expected to be strengthened in the next three years.</p>
                        <p>The three-year action plan presented here represents a continuation of
                            programs this Administration has already put into place, is consistent
                            with and supportive of the major international recommendations of the

                            plans of the concerned Departments and Agencies will continue these
                            programs. The action plan in FY 1989–91 anticipates expansion of
                            technical assistance and other activities for <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2"
                                >AIDS</gloss> prevention and control worldwide and increasing
                            effectiveness of these activities.</p>
                        <p>The following achievements are illustrative of the progress anticipated
                            during the period of this three-year action plan:</p>
                        <p>1. All countries with which the U.S. is working will have implemented
                                <gloss target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_HIV_1"
                                >HIV</gloss> public information campaigns.</p>
                        <p>2. All of these countries will also have implemented, and most will have
                            evaluated, targeted educational programs aimed at the reduction of
                            high-risk behavior.</p>
                        <p>3. All of these countries will have implemented blood transfusion
                            screening programs for <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss>. There will
                            be a safe source in each country, however, only a few will have ensured
                            complete freedom of the blood supply from <gloss target="#t_HIV_1"
                                >HIV</gloss> infection.</p>
                        <p>4. New rapid, simple <gloss target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> diagnostics
                            appropriate for developing countries will have been field-tested and
                            will be in common use.</p>
                        <p>5. Development of vaccine field trial sites will have taken place.</p>
                        <p>6. Models of the economic and demographic impact of the pandemic in the
                            developing world will have been completed and validated and will be in
                            use to further understanding and to more effectively target <gloss
                                target="#t_HIV_1">HIV</gloss> control strategies.</p>
