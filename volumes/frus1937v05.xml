                            reference to your letter of December 6, 1937, transmitting copies of the
                            Project of Regulations for the Eighth International Conference of
                            American States and requesting that observations concerning the Project
                            be transmitted to the Pan American Union on or before March 1, 1938.</p>
                        <p>I desire to state that I have no suggestions to offer regarding the
                            Regulations except to express on behalf of the United States of America
                            a preference for article 11 of the Regulations of the Seventh
                            International Conference of American States rather than the
                            corresponding proposed article 11.<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">The
                                proposed article 11 read: “Art. 11. Delegates may speak in their own
                                languages from manuscript or otherwise, and, if requested, the
                                interpreters shall render a summary of the remarks in the other
                                official languages of the Conference.”</note> Both of the articles
                            in question appear on page 6 of the Report of the Subcommittee and deal
                            with the official languages of the Conference and interpretations. In
                            place of the proposed article 11 it is suggested that the following
                            corresponding article of the Regulations of the Montevideo Conference be
                            substituted: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            authority weakened and the opportunity for a final peace lost.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Paraguayan attitude</hi>. A few men formerly in power,
                            notably ex-President Ayala and General Estigarribia, realize that it
                            would be advantageous for Paraguay to make certain concessions in order
                            to obtain a settlement and permanent peace. Unfortunately, however, the
                            Franco government is determined to remain in power at all costs and
                            lacks both the courage and intelligence to adopt such a patriotic
                            viewpoint. They fear to make the slightest concession in view of the
                            pressure of short-sighted younger army officers, a sedulously cultivated
                            jingo public opinion and the criticism which political enemies would
                            direct at any agreement. In such circumstances inaction seems best to
                            them—and this accounts for the interminable delays, trifling but
                            time-consuming objections, shameless contradictions and refusals to
                            listen to reason. Furthermore, most Paraguayans are genuinely convinced
                            they won the war, that the Chaco is rightfully theirs, that it would be
                            reprehensible to withdraw one inch from their present positions or
                            extend any port facilities to Bolivia and that were hostilities renewed
                            they would again be victorious. Moreover, great store is set by the June
                            12 Protocol provision that the Conference cannot be dissolved until the
                            arbitral compromise is definitely agreed upon. Strict compliance with
                            this clause would enable the Paraguayans, through their insistence upon
                            the inclusion of unreasonable conditions, to defer more or less
                            indefinitely the drafting of the arbitral compromise; thus their Fabian
                            tactics would keep the Conference alive and <hi rend="italic">ipso
                                facto</hi> leave them, guaranteed by the six mediatory nations, in
                            their war’s-end positions in the Chaco.…</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Bolivian attitude</hi>. Many Bolivians believe, with
                            some reason according to neutral military authorities, that were
                            hostilities renewed Paraguay would be driven eastward. But the
                            ex-combatants are war-weary and prefer a face-saving settlement. Certain
                            mining and financial interests, pursuant to arguments gradually
                            developed by Ambassador Nieto of Chile and myself during the last year,
                            now state that they are willing to supply up to £200,000 for payment to
                            Paraguay as an inducement for a final settlement. Foreign Minister Finot
                            frequently acts or speaks precipitously and unwisely but so far when the
                            facts are presented has been willing to resume a reasonable course. Dr.
                            Alvéstegui, chairman of the Bolivian delegation, until now has been
                            intelligent and cooperative.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mediatory nations’ attitude</hi>. Chile realizes that a
                            failure to conclude a definitive Chaco peace might entail a renewal by
                            Bolivia of annoying attempts to obtain an outlet to the Pacific.
                            Ambassador Nieto, together with a few other Chileans, believes that a
                            corridor to the ocean should eventually be ceded to Bolivia but does not
                            wish <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0016"/>the question forced upon Chile
                            now. Hence Chile desires a final settlement which, insofar as possible,
                            will be satisfactory to Bolivia. Ambassador Nieto throughout has been
                            one of the most useful members of the Conference. Last November he
                            presented his credentials as Ambassador in Brazil; twice I have
                            intervened in order to obtain his continued presence here until now, but
                            in another thirty days he must depart for Rio de Janeiro…</p>
                        <p>Peru logically might be expected to have the same attitude as Chile but
                            instead the Lima government so far has shown relatively small interest
                            in the negotiations.…</p>
                        <p>Uruguay appears to have scant interest one way or the other. Delegate
                            Manini Ríos was helpful until he, in effect, withdrew from our
                            deliberations in December 1935.…</p>
                        <p>Brazil’s contribution has been of the greatest value and Ambassador
                            Rodrigues Alves the ablest member of the Conference. Unfortunately,
                            despite his two months’ vacation during January to March of this year
                            Dr. Rodrigues Alves is worn by the grind of the Conference and,
                            notwithstanding such encouragement as I have been able to give him, is
                            developing a defeatist attitude towards the Chaco problem, which I sense
                            is reflected in the Brazilian Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>Argentina’s antagonism during most of 1936 to the Franco régime has
                            evaporated and there is reason to believe that the appalling delay of
                            three months in getting the Special Military Commission to the Chaco is
                            partly due to Argentine (Saavedra Lamas’?) willingness to play the
                            Paraguayan game of procrastination—an assumption which coincides with
                            the widely held impression that Argentina directly assisted Paraguay
                            during the war.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In view of the serious situation we now face it appears advisable that
                            soon an appeal should be made to President Justo to restrain his Foreign
                            Minister. Ambassadors Rodrigues Alves, Nieto and I already have taken
                            certain steps in this direction and hope to discuss the situation
                            frankly and fully with acting president Julio Roca at a dinner to be
                            attended only by the four of us and which Nieto hopes to arrange within
                            the next week or ten days.</p>
                        <p>An appeal to the personal pride of President Justo and Dr. Saavedra Lamas
                            should be effective—on the basis that for them to go out of office this
                            year with the Chaco question unsettled would more than destroy any

                        <p>My interpretation of the United States attitude is: Being entirely free
                            of any direct interest in the dispute our sole objective is the <pb
                                n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0017"/>consummation of a permanent peace
                            between Bolivia and Paraguay, not alone for reasons of humanity and good
                            neighborliness but still more to prevent the almost inevitable
                            resumption of war, sooner or later, following upon a failure of the
                            Conference. Of greater importance than the Chaco or the pretensions of
                            the two ex-belligerent nations is the preservation of the laboriously
                            constructed American peace system recently strengthened at the
                            Maintenance of Peace Conference. Another war would greatly damage this
                            peace structure and probably throw back to European influence those
                            discouraged elements of Latin America which under the recent strong
                            leadership of the United States have been signally oriented toward
                            pan-American cooperation. So prominent has been our Latin American
                            policy that a failure of this Conference would react with especial force
                            on the United States. Also, there would be loss of prestige for all the
                            mediatory governments and the heaping of reproach and ridicule upon the
                            individuals involved.</p>
                        <p>It is an accomplishment for the Conference that the Bolivian Foreign
                            Minister and delegates now, in private conversations with Ambassador
                            Rodrigues Alves, Nieto and me, frankly contemplate a final agreement
                            which would: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) give Bolivia a free instead of a
                            sovereign port on the Paraguay river; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            establish a permanent frontier 75 to 150 kilometers east of the
                            intermediary line; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) have Bolivia pay £200,000
                            to Paraguay. These terms should satisfy Paraguay—ex-President Ayala and
                            General Estigarribia, I am sure, would approve them—but unhappily it is
                            quite another matter to obtain their acceptance by the Franco
                            government. In fact, Ambassador Nieto of Chile and I are the only two
                            persons acquainted with the negotiations who see any chance for a
                            territorial settlement. This chance may be slight but so long as it
                            exists the mediatory nations, in a united front, must redouble their
                            efforts, patience and ingenuity in order to achieve a territorial
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing analysis of the situation it becomes obvious that the
                            principal obstacle to a final peace is the frame of mind of present
                            Paraguayan leaders. In order to bring them to reason two methods are at
                            hand: inducement and pressure.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of whether or not the transit and security regulations<note

                            delegates—notably Ambassador Rodrigues Alves of Brazil, Ambassador Nieto
                            del Río of Chile, Dr. Bunge of Argentina and myself—to La Paz and
                            Asuncíon should be taken as soon as possible. On our visit to the latter
                            city it will be necessary for us to approach those really in control,
                            one after another, and convince them of the manifold advantages of a <pb
                                n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0018"/>settlement which may be synthetized
                            as follows: Peace will allow full and free economic development, foreign
                            capital will feel safer, and a cash payment from Bolivia is a prize much
                            needed to bolster sadly deficient public finances. Paraguayan objectives
                            in the war will be substantially satisfied by apportioning to that
                            country a major portion of the Chaco and the refusal of a sovereign port
                            to Bolivia. On the other hand, Paraguay cannot expect to repeat her
                            successes of the recent war but, on the contrary, may be driven back so
                            that a far less satisfactory settlement would result from another
                            conflict. In urging the delegates’ trips to Asunción I am not forgetful
                            of the possible embarrassments which may arise and that we may be
                            treated in cavalier fashion; nevertheless, I think these visits should
                            be taken.</p>
                        <p>All possible legitimate pressure must be applied to Paraguay. In so doing
                            it is essential that the six mediatory countries present a single front.
                            Argentina, by reason of its unique influence in Paraguay, and the United
                            States, because of its impartiality, will carry the greatest weight.</p>
                        <p>Any course now laid down for the territorial discussions may have to be
                            changed because of future developments but the present program for the
                            Conference is as follows:</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the plan approved by the Conference on December 25,
                            1936 (see my despatch No. 353<note n="8" xml:id="d6fn8">Dated January
                                14, 1937; not printed.</note>), a time limit (not more than two to
                            three months) to be set for the active, direct negotiation of a possible
                            frontier. On its expiration should an agreement not be in view a further
                            period (not to exceed four months) to be allotted for the drafting of an
                            arbitral compromise for submission to the Permanent Court of
                            International Justice. Delegates’ trips to the ex-belligerent countries
                            to be made during the above two periods. Should the draft agreement not
                            be in sight at the conclusion of this latter period the Conference to
                            adjourn and issue a declaration placing the blame where it
                            belongs—probably, Paraguayan disinclination to reason. Were this
                            procedure to be followed Paraguay could, and undoubtedly would, allege
                            that the six mediatory nations had violated their solemn agreement under
                            the June 12, 1935, Protocol (Article I (3), second paragraph) not to
                            adjourn the Conference until a definite accord had been reached. Yet
                            these six powers should not be forced to act as tools of Paraguayan
                            intransigence and to remain indefinitely as the guardians of a
                            Paraguayan occupation of disputed territory—an occupation which is
                            recognized as temporary by the Protocols. Thus we are between the Scylla
                            of a failure strictly to comply with our international commitments under
                            the Protocols and the Charybdis of violating the spirit of those same
                            instruments. If we follow the latter course we stultify ourselves,
                            subject Bolivia to an injustice <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0019"/>and
                            open the way to future conflict. Therefore, it is my opinion that the
                            Conference must place a time limit on its deliberations but I would like
                            to receive the Department’s views in this particular.</p>
                        <p>The threat of a Conference declaration along the above lines might bring
                            Paraguay to heel. It is even possible that its issuance would upset the
                            Franco régime, bringing in other politicians who—especially if they have
                            General Estigarribia at their head—would be willing to compromise and
                            effect a settlement.</p>
                        <p>I submit the following specific recommendations for possible action by
                            the Department: <list>

                                    in an attempt to reach a successful conclusion. Also, it would
                                    be beneficial were the Chilean government induced to continue

                            April 20, 1937, following are the Department’s views with respect to the
                            specific recommendations made by you regarding the further course of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The necessity for a vigorous effort to reach a settlement on the
                            territorial issue has been urged upon both the Argentine and Brazilian
                            Ambassadors during conversations with them at the Department. This
                            policy will be continued whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
                        <p>The Department would be prepared to send a message to the Paraguayan
                            Government as indicated in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) on page

                            upon the situation calling for such action and upon circumstances being
                            opportune.</p>
                        <p>Whenever the Paraguayan Minister has come to the Department, occasion has
                            been taken to talk with him about the desirability of reaching a
                            definitive settlement of the territorial issue. This procedure also will
                            be continued.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that the trade agreements program cannot
                            be used in any effective manner to induce favorable action in the Chaco

                                Brazil and Chile, distressed at the slow pace that the President of
                                the Conference wishes to give to the fundamental negotiations, in
                                opposition to the views of their respective governments in putting
                                an end as soon as possible to the territorial dispute of the Chaco,
                                considered the situation and arrived at the following conclusions:

                                        letter and the spirit of the Protocols, the Conference in

                                    <item>That the President of the Conference was taking as acts of
                                        sabotage on the part of certain Delegations, the loyal
                                        efforts looking to avoid a rupture of the same, renewing
                                        suspicions and fears which he showed every time at moments
                                        of crisis when he did not see a possibility of
                                        solution.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>These conclusions having been examined from all angles, the means
                                were studied to influence the spirit of the President of the
                                Conference to make him change his policies. In various sessions
                                ideas of this nature were voiced, especially when it was necessary
                                to exercise real pressure for the quick termination of the
                                Regulations on the road and the distancing of the nuclei of troops.
                                In private conversations also, we tried to reflect the urgency of
                                the solution of the fundamental question, but all this without
                                arriving at a definite answer from Sr. Saavedra Lamas, whose general
                                attitude is the deprecation of ideas. It was also necessary to take
                                into account the attitude of General Martínez Pita, President of the
                                Special Military Commission, which has the same tendencies as those
                                of Sr. Saavedra Lamas, the former having stated that politicians and
                                diplomats make the Chaco more confused, whose solution only military
                                men can achieve. And lastly, we had to consider the Paraguayan
                                policy which consists in delaying the fundamental solution as much
                                as possible, since nothing interests it except the consolidation of
                                the occupied territory.</p>
                            <p>Convinced that direct action on Sr. Saavedra Lamas would not have the
                                desired effect, the Delegate of Chile proposed and the idea was
                                accepted, to seek an intimate conversation with Dr. Julio Roca, Vice
                                President of the Republic, then Acting President, so that he might
                                carry the result to the knowledge of the President of the Nation.
                                The <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0022"/>said delegate invited Dr.
                                Roca to dine with Delegates Rodrigues Alves and Braden on April 23
                                in a private dining room of the Plaza Hotel. With the necessary
                                prudence, the situation was explained to the Vice President.
                                Convinced of the value of our observations, Dr. Roca promised to
                                speak to General Justo and moreover, to demonstrate the personal
                                interest which he had in helping and the consideration which he had
                                for the three delegates, suggested the idea of having in the same
                                place a dinner with the President of the Republic and the Minister
                                of Foreign Relations, which was naturally accepted, as it was
                                considered of great importance. Dr. Roca suggested extending the
                                invitation to the other delegates. The representatives pointed out
                                to Dr. Roca that the others are permanent Ambassadors accredited to
                                the Argentine Government, which would prevent them from expressing
                                their opinions with the full freedom which the case demanded, the
                                reason for which the Chilean Delegate had not invited them.</p>
                            <p>In short, the conversation with Dr. Roca was the greatest
                                opportunity. With the well known correctness of his conduct as the
                                perfect gentleman, he informed the Foreign Minister of the
                                invitation which had been extended to him. The first question which
                                he set forth was that the success of the Conference depended on the
                                individual disinterestedness that each of the mediatory governments
                                would display, since if each one, or some, pursued determined
                                advantages at the expense of a solution of the Chaco, then the unity
                                of the Conference was lost and with it the possibility of reaching a
                                common objective. It was easy to see that Sr. Saavedra Lamas had
                                thrown over the spirit of the Vice President an odious doubt
                                regarding the mediators. He had once more expressed his lack of
                                confidence in the other governments and his obsession of sabotage.
                                With energy and an abundance of arguments, the Delegates took away
                                from Dr. Roca the last trace of doubt that the words of the Foreign
                                Minister might have left there. He suggested action by the
                                presidents of the other mediatory countries to collaborate with the
                                Argentine Executive.</p>
                            <p>He was then shown the extreme urgency of reaching the fundamental
                                question, this being principally based on the nearness of the
                                presidential elections in Argentina and the danger of war which
                                would be brought on by the unjustified abandonment of the question
                                while one of the parties is in possession of territory under
                                discussion. Since the procedure to be followed is laid down in the
                                Protocols, there is no valid reason not to exercise the authority
                                that the mediatory countries have.</p>
                            <p>The Delegates had a satsfactory impression of the step they had just
                                taken, without discounting the dangers in it, since in the last
                                analysis the conversation with Dr. Roca and that which they would
                                    <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0023"/>soon have with H. E. the
                                President consisted in very daring diplomacy. But they would have no
                                reason to regret it, no matter what were the consequences, in view
                                of the attitude of the Argentine Foreign Minister which was
                                evaluated as being fatal for the peace of America and the prestige
                                of the mediatory governments. Moreover, the eminent personality of
                                Dr. Roca, free of all international prejudices, as well as that no
                                less eminent one of General Justo, were sufficient protection for
                                the propriety of the delicate step.</p>
                            <p>On Thursday, April 29, the dinner with the President of the Nation
                                occurred in the same place as before. The Delegates had beforehand
                                exchanged ideas and decided what it would be necessary to discuss.
                                It was early seen that Sr. Saavedra Lamas was trying to keep the
                                conversation on subjects foreign to the principal objective, an easy
                                thing for him who possesses in the highest measure a gift of
                                talking. Two or three attempts to broach the subject were turned off
                                with undisguised design. Finally, the President himself cleverly
                                made the opening for discussion of the matter.</p>
                            <p>The conversation may be resumed as follows:</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Delegate of the United
                                    States:</hi></p>
                            <p>While we are all keenly aware of the urgent necessity of arriving at
                                a territorial settlement, and look with horror upon the possible
                                renewal of hostilities with all of the bloodshed and suffering
                                involved, nevertheless, more important than these considerations or
                                the interests of Bolivia and Paraguay is the preservation of the
                                American peace system developed by President Justo and his Foreign
                                Minister, together with the other presidents and foreign ministers,
                                particularly of the mediatory nations. Naturally I am especially
                                concerned respecting my own president—President Roosevelt—and
                                Secretary Hull, and that their contributions to this system shall
                                not be dissipated through a renewal of hostilities. Certainly
                                another Chaco war would do untold damage to the American peace
                                system and to the authority and prestige of all our presidents and
                                statesmen and would bring ridicule upon us delegates who have been
                                directly involved in the negotiations.</p>
                            <p>I am entirely convinced that if we fail to reach a solution to the
                                territorial problem another war is inevitable. Two things may
                                happen: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) If the Bolivians feel that they
                                have sufficient documentary and other evidence in hand as a result
                                of the various Conference declarations and agreements they may make
                                a unilateral appeal to the Permanent Court of International Justice

                                Bolivians would seize the road and the adjacent territory. There is
                                in Bolivia a certain spirit of revenge. The younger army officers,
                                headed by Colonel Busch, are determined to erase the black marks of
                                defeat.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Braden said that while he greatly respected General
                                Martínez Pita’s opinion, in this instance he could not agree with
                                him. In fact, the very distinguished position held by General
                                Martínez Pita—General of Division of the Argentine army, President
                                of the Special Military Commission and Special Delegate—placed him
                                in a position where he was regarded with awe by the ex-belligerent
                                lesser officers so that during his short stay in the Chaco—one week
                                in Asunción and five or six days in Villa Montes—those officers did
                                not dare display to him their real sentiments. Whereas, Major

                                General Martínez Pita, has lived for six months in the Chaco during
                                1936 where he slept, ate, drank, played cards with and was on terms
                                of intimate comradeship with both the Bolivian and Paraguayan
                                officers, who have unbosomed themselves to him frankly. Major Weeks
                                declares that if the Conference fails he considers that there is an
                                80% probability that war will be renewed within a year and
                                thereafter this percentage will increase rapidly.</p>
                            <p>The American Delegate joined with his colleagues to insist that the
                                mediatory nations must, as a unit, attack the territorial question
                                with determination, energy and with the exercise of all the
                                influence and prestige within their power.</p>
                            <p>At an opportune moment, in answer to a question by President Justo,
                                Ambassador Braden explained why the other delegates were not
                                present. The three that were present, he said, had no duties outside
                                the Conference. We eat, sleep and breathe the Chaco and therefore
                                can and do dedicate all our time and effort to it. He added that
                                nevertheless, the other delegates were entirely in accord with the
                                program to pursue the territorial question energetically in order to
                                conclude a final peace before President Justo and Sr. Saavedra Lamas
                                left office. He then read a statement which that very afternoon he
                                had read to the Conference in the name of his government: <quote

                                    <p>“In view of the seriousness of the deliberations on which we
                                        are now entering, I keep the State Department informed of
                                        all the details possible. I am therefore pleased to inform
                                        Your Excellencies that my government has instructed me to
                                        express its pleasure at the fact that all the mediatory
                                        delegates agree completely with my statement made at the
                                        meeting of April 21 and repeated yesterday. That is, that we
                                        are resolved to go to the bottom of the territorial question
                                        with energy, wholeheartedness and determination, giving at

                                        sufficient publicity to our activities so that the world may
                                        know of our labors. In accordance with this firm intention
                                        of the Conference my government agrees with our resolution
                                        taken yesterday but believes that the only chance of success
                                        lies in our being prepared to meet everyday and if
                                        necessary, all day, at any time and any place—i. e.
                                        imitating the work which was so effective in seeking a
                                        solution for the prisoners’ problem, a procedure which it is
                                        easy to follow.</p>
                                    <p>“Several of the mediatory nations have special ambassadors
                                        accredited to the Conference who devote their time
                                        exclusively to the Chaco and are disposed at all times to
                                        give their collaboration to the intense work required by the
                                        Conference in accordance with the plan of time limits fixed
                                        and approved by the Conference as its own internal program
                                        from now on at the meeting of December 25 last.”</p>

                            <p>The delegate added that the program outlined therein had met with
                                unanimous approval, and Sr. Saavedra Lamas said he agreed and that
                                this was an accurate statement of the program.</p>
                            <p>In entire agreement with the opinion of his colleagues Ambassador
                                Braden further emphasized that there was complete accord and unity
                                between each and every one of the mediatory delegates and repeated
                                his simile previously made that the Conference might be compared to
                                a football team, in which individual skill only is of little use,
                                for victory cannot be obtained excepting through complete
                                coordination and team play.</p>
                            <p>President Justo remarked that the presidents of the other five
                                mediatory nations might also help the Conference to which he replied
                                that undoubtedly they could and would do so when called upon, but
                                that in the final analysis the playing field was in Buenos Aires and
                                therefore President Jusio’s intervention would prove the most
                                effective.</p>
                            <p>When Sr. Saavedra Lamas objected that President Justo should not be
                                requested to intervene unless the Conference were absolutely sure of
                                success on the territorial question Ambassador Braden rejoined that
                                a Conference failure would be a greater blow to President Justo’s
                                prestige and that precisely to protect his prestige it would be
                                desirable for him to exercise his great influence and power.</p>
                            <p>Upon President Justo’s expressing some doubts as to whether the
                                intransigence of the parties could be overcome, the American
                                delegate replied that he had reached his position as a leader of a
                                great nation only by boldly facing stubborn intransigence and that
                                many a time he undoubtedly had overcome what appeared to be
                                unsurmountable obstacles by sheer determination and energy and that
                                the Conference, with the President’s support, could with similar
                                determination and energy confidently overcome all obstacles and
                                reach the final peace.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Delegate of Brazil:</hi></p>
                            <p>The Brazilian Ambassador, when he took part in the conversation,
                                insisted on the need to observe the time limits fixed in the session
                                of <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0026"/>December 25, since it was
                                not possible for the Conference to meet indefinitely, awaiting that
                                the parties should arrive at a direct agreement. And later added:
                                One must not lose sight of the fact that the Conference was born in
                                Buenos Aires at the time of the visit of President Vargas, taking
                                advantage of the magnificent atmosphere and under the propitious
                                situation of an extensive cordiality throughout America. It was
                                called by President Justo and it must end before the expiration of
                                the actual administration. The administration to come will not have
                                the same interests or the same responsibility as that which called
                                it and would find the subject already worn by the natural action of
                                the elapsed time. We therefore must hurry, that the fundamental
                                question may be considered with a will to solve it as soon as
                                possible using every effort to reach this goal. This is the desire
                                of all the delegates which have maintained an immovable solidarity.
                                Let us take advantage of this spirit and we will arrive at the end
                                of our difficult task. The Delegate of Brazil pointed out that this
                                was the opinion of his government which has no other aim than to
                                cooperate with all the mediators, with the hope that the solution
                                will come out of Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>He maintained the same arguments as Ambassadors Nieto and Braden on
                                the dangers to which we were exposed, of a new armed conflict on the
                                day the parties should feel helpless and on their own. On account of
                                this, he said, come our justified apprehensions and fears. This is
                                not a baseless opinion, since our Military Observers who have lived
                                the life of the Chaco in the most complete intimacy with Paraguayan
                                and Bolivian officers had received the same painful impression.</p>
                            <p>The argument of Nieto’s that we had a sum of money which Bolivia is
                                willing to put at the disposal of the Conference once the problem
                                were about to be definitely solved, caused a profound impression.
                                For the rich men of Bolivia, that is the miners, are those who
                                suffered most during the war and will continue to suffer before the
                                uncertainties and dangers of a new war.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Delegate of Chile:</hi></p>
                            <p>The Chilean Ambassador from the beginning of the conversation pointed
                                out the real dangers of a new war if the Conference without
                                justified and categorical reason left things as they are under the
                                pretext that calm and prudence are advisable when it is not
                                necessary to call upon them, but on the contrary to use them in the
                                measure that they are ordinarily used in any serious endeavor, while
                                now the need was especially for authority and the prestige of
                                mediation to overcome the tendency to be seen in Paraguay to
                                consolidate its conquests over a territory in dispute. It is
                                necessary to clear up the procedure in accordance with the time
                                limits adopted at the session of December <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17"
                                    facs="0027"/>25, 1936. He quoted the opinion of reliable
                                military men, such as General Fuentes, Major Weeks and Captain
                                Bastos, besides other trustworthy reports. He said it would be sad
                                to arrive at the VIII Pan American Conference in Lima<note n="11"
                                    xml:id="d8fn11">See <ref target="#pg_1">pp. 1</ref> ff.</note>
                                with a war impending, or without having resolved the territorial
                                question.</p>
                            <p>He then said to the President that he had in his hands the
                                opportunity to take advantage of the excellent disposition of Chile,
                                Brazil and the United States to arrive at a rapid solution, since
                                these countries had a close unity of views, a single complete
                                loyalty to the work of the Conference and a common desire not to
                                lose time. That moreover, none of them nor the other mediatory
                                countries had special interests or advantages to obtain from a
                                solution of the Chaco, aside from the common advantage of
                                international peace. To a question of the President as to what could
                                be effectively done to initiate the fundamental question, the
                                Delegate of Chile answered that there would be many ways of giving
                                an atmosphere of authority to the negotiations; that at the moment a
                                means of great effect occurred to him, that the debate on the
                                problem be declared solemnly open in a session with the parties,
                                given added dignity if presided over by H. E. the President of the
                                Argentine Republic, which in no way would mean a diminution of the
                                authority of the President of the Conference. The delegate recalled
                                that the presidents of Chile and Argentina had personally risked
                                their prestige in taking the initiative in stopping a war which was
                                raging; that President Justo had inaugurated the Chaco Conference
                                without any assurance of success; that President Roosevelt had come
                                to Buenos Aires to open the Conference for the Maintenance of Peace.
                                The Delegate of Chile supported all the views of his colleagues on
                                the principal points of the conversation. At the last, Ambassador
                                Nieto said more or less as follows: “I believe, Mr. Minister, that
                                an understanding will not be so difficult if at a given moment
                                pecuniary compensation is called into play. On this I have something
                                to say. It would be almost a lack of respect to ask of H. E. the
                                President of the Nation and the Foreign Minister, to keep this
                                completely confidential; but I dare to ask it for the good success
                                of the negotiations. I may assure you that Bolivia will supply a
                                considerable sum of money, perhaps two hundred thousand pounds, for
                                a prompt and good arrangement. After long negotiations which began
                                last year, just as in the case of the subsidy for the prisoners, the
                                final word I obtained a few days ago from my Bolivian mining
                                friends, so that the Conference has at its disposal a most useful
                                element—a <hi rend="italic">nervum rerun</hi>—to convince the
                                Paraguayan government, if we do not allow a long time to pass, for
                                we must be aware of the price of tin.”</p>

                            <p>He insisted various times on the need to conduct the fundamental
                                negotiations slowly, step by step, seeking out all the means of
                                prudence. He referred quickly to the unstable conditions of the
                                internal politics of Paraguay and Bolivia. He maintained with
                                tenacity the nonexistence of any danger of the renewal of
                                hostilities, saying that this was the opinion of the Argentine
                                military officers, General Martínez Pita, Captain Vacca, etc., for
                                Bolivia after its warlike shattering was not in a situation to renew
                                the war, nor was Paraguay due to the latter’s financial weakness. He
                                gave no value whatever to the contrary opinions set forth by the
                                delegates on the logical basis of the reports of their military men.
                                He rejected the idea of direct action by President Justo, before
                                there were assurances of an arrangement. He gave some attention to
                                the report by the Delegate of Chile regarding the sum of money which
                                could be counted on, but this impression did not determine him to
                                outline any plan for rapid action, but on the contrary repeated his
                                comments favoring the policy of indefinite time. When he was
                                reminded of the definite time limits which he himself had
                                enthusiastically adopted at the session of December 25, he was quiet
                                as though surprised at something that he did not recall. When the
                                President interrupted him to add the words “and firmness” to those
                                of tranquillity and patience which he had used, the Foreign Minister
                                did not give any sign of agreeing with the clear intent of General
                                Justo, nor at the time that the Delegate of Brazil repeated these
                                words. He had the same indifferent attitude when after dinner the
                                President gave a graphic representation with fists and foot of a
                                reply General Foch gave on the way in which he expected to resolve
                                the problems of the Single Command during the Great War.</p>

                            No. 406 of April 20, 1937, wherein I commented on the many delays
                            encountered by the Peace Conference and stated that “the Conference must
                            now demonstrate that definite progress towards a final solution is being
                            made, otherwise its prestige will be undermined, its authority weakened
                            and the opportunity for a final peace lost”.</p>
                        <p>On April 23 the Conference formally approved the regulations for transit,

                            June 16 Colonel Trabal (Uruguayan Army) and Captain Vacca (Argentine
                            Army) were despatched to the Chaco to put the regulations in force; on
                            May 25 the Bolivian and Paraguayan Foreign Ministers exchanged telegrams
                            declaring diplomatic relations renewed; on June 8 the Conference
                            resolved that direct negotiations on the fundamental question were
                            opened; and on July 12 the Conference reaffirmed this resolution.
                            Nevertheless, the regulations are not in force; ministers have not been
                            appointed, hence diplomatic relations have not been effectively renewed;
                            and little useful discussion on the territorial question has been had in

                                <item>As I have, on various occasions, informed the Department, it
                                    has become increasingly apparent during the last several months
                                    that the supreme consideration of Dr. Saavedra Lamas, Conference
                                    president, is to preserve his personal reputation as the Great
                                    Peacemaker. He fears to face the difficulties which necessarily
                                    will arise in the territorial negotiations or the drafting of
                                    the arbitral compromise and frequently has admitted of late that
                                    his earnest hope is to pass the Chaco question to the World
                                    Court for solution. Failing in this, his program will be through
                                    procrastination and obstruction to avoid the Conference actively
                                    entering the territorial negotiations until he has retired from
                                    office, so that the responsibility will fall on his successor as
                                    Foreign Minister and Conference president. Last year, at Geneva
                                    and elsewhere, he had it widely circulated that nothing remained
                                    to be settled in the Chaco but a mere question of boundaries
                                    such as exists between many countries (<hi rend="italic"
                                        >sic</hi>). Thus, he would disparage success as an
                                    unimportant detail made possible by his own efforts, and

                                <item>Dr. Saavedra Lamas’ desire for Argentine domination—at least
                                    economically—over the Chaco and southeastern Bolivia, coupled
                                    with a fantastic fear that his country is surrounded by envious
                                    neighbors who are forming “blocs” with one another directed
                                    against Argentine interests. This reasoning by the Foreign
                                    Minister perhaps leads him to believe that the best policy to
                                    pursue is either to make the final peace alone, free from the
                                    other mediatory powers, or to perpetuate the division between at
                                    least two of Argentina’s five neighbors—<hi rend="italic">divide

                                    Chaco problem at this Conference, and if possible before the

                                <item>Previously, my Brazilian and Chilean colleagues (Ambassadors
                                    Rodrigues Alves and Nieto del Río) and I have been able to
                                    circumvent Dr. Saavedra Lamas’ personal peculiarities, delays
                                    and obstructions by reasoning, flattery, and other means,
                                    doubtless because his and our final objectives were then
                                    identical; now they are different and it has been amply proven
                                    that our former methods with him no longer are successful.
                                    Therefore they must be changed.</item>

                        <p>As the opening broadside in my new campaign (activating the dismay at the
                                <hi rend="italic">El Mundo</hi> article transmitted in my despatch
                            No. 468 of July 29, 1937<note n="13" xml:id="d9fn13">Not
                            printed.</note>), I read my enclosed statement of July 30 at the
                            Conference session held that day at my insistence after it had been
                            cancelled by Dr. Saavedra Lamas. He did not attend. It had a decided
                            effect. Also, it brought out the fact that my Uruguayan and Peruvian
                            colleagues apparently have not been presenting to their governments a
                            true picture of the sad course of this Conference, and they made it
                            clear to me that were my statement to appear in the minutes they would
                            be subject to criticism by their governments. I therefore agreed that it
                            should not appear in the minutes but threatened to read it in should
                            there be any further cancellation of meetings and procrastination. This
                            mild piece of blackmail will, I hope, have a salutary effect. During the
                            session of July 301 likewise commented upon the unjustifiable number of
                            meetings which had been cancelled (see enclosed schedule for July).<note

                        <p>As a second step in my program I refer to the special report from the
                            Military Observers dated July 28 and the personal letter dated July 27
                            addressed to me by Major John A. Weeks, both enclosed with my despatch
                            No. 473 of August 2, 1937.<note n="13" xml:id="d9fn16">Not
                                printed.</note> The situation described in those two communications
                            is dangerous and, in view of that fact, at the session of August 21 read
                            the statement appearing as enclosure No. 2. The essential was the
                            removal of Bolivian and Paraguayan troops from their present positions
                            almost in contact with one another. Hence when Sr. Ramírez, Paraguayan
                            delegate, was invited to the meeting, he was informed this withdrawal of
                            the troops from near the line of “hitos” must take place without delay.
                            I repeated to him that <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0032"/>if this is
                            not done, I shall in duty bound have to recommend to my government that
                            it discontinue its moral guarantee. Sr. Ramírez did not answer; this may
                            be an indication that he was impressed.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, I shall, as heretofore, exercise every precaution, in
                            carrying forward these new tactics, to avoid any serious clash with Dr.
                            Saavedra Lamas. But I trust the Department will agree with me that it is
                            impossible to permit things to continue as they were going, and that it
                            is imperative that action be obtained.</p>

                                <item>At the end of 1936, aside from some minor matters, there
                                    remained three important problems to be settled: (<hi

                                    question of territory and boundaries. Seven months of this year
                                    have gone by, the diplomatic relations are not effective, the
                                    regulations are not in force, and there has been almost no
                                    discussion of territory and boundaries, so that matters stand

                                <item>After the regulations were approved in the latter part of
                                    April, it was repeatedly declared in the sessions of this
                                    Conference by several delegates including myself, that we were
                                    then resolved to enter the fundamental question with energy,
                                    dedication and determination, at the same time giving sufficient
                                    publicity to our activities so that the world would know of our
                                    endeavors. At that time there was unanimity of opinion that the
                                    periods of two and three months for direct negotiations and
                                    drafting of the arbitral compromise respectively, be adopted for
                                    the internal order of the Conference. Three months have passed
                                    and, despite the fact that nearly two months ago, in our June
                                    8th resolution, we formally declared, in a published resolution,
                                    that the period for direct negotiations was inaugurated,
                                    actually nothing has been done.</item>

                                <item>Ambassador Barreda Laos, on December 28th (Act 108), proposed,
                                    was seconded by me, and it was unanimously agreed, that we
                                    should meet daily in order, in particular, to forward the
                                    territory-boundary negotiations. Again, on May 7th (Act 133), I
                                    had the honor to refer to my distinguished Peruvian colleague’s
                                    resolution and <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0033"/>urge that
                                    it be carried out. In deference to the wishes of some of those
                                    present, it was decided that instead of meeting daily, we should
                                    meet on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays of each week. This we
                                    have not done by any manner of means. How can we expect the
                                    parties to respect our resolutions and acts if we, ourselves, do
                                    not live up to them?</item>

                                <item>I want to emphasize again the unanimous opinion which has been
                                    stated time and again in this Conference, that the Peace
                                    Conference must wind up its work in Buenos Aires, before the
                                    Government of President Justo goes out of office and our
                                    distinguished President’s present term of office is over. I
                                    fully appreciate, however, that some of the delegates and, in
                                    particular, our distinguished President, have many other
                                    obligations and responsibilities, which may impede their
                                    attending every session, but I am sure that we can always count
                                    upon the attendance of the other Argentine delegates and, in the
                                    case of any very important action or resolution, we should, of
                                    course, whenever possible, defer its passage until the absent
                                    delegates have had an opportunity to express their opinions so
                                    that our resolution may, as always, be unanimous.</item>

                                    successfully to arrive at a territory-boundary agreement, will
                                    be by following a procedure similar to that adopted by the
                                    prisoners’ committee, whose success was crowned by the signing

                                    night, in what were practically all-day sessions every day. This
                                    delegation will have the honor, within the near future I hope,
                                    to propose the formal adoption of such a procedure but, in the
                                    meantime, it urges that the Conference rigidly adhere to the
                                    resolution of May 7th, now in force, and that hereafter no
                                    scheduled sessions be cancelled.</item>

                            <p>The situation described in the special report dated July 28 received
                                from the Military Observers and Major Weeks’ letter of July 27,
                                which I have just roughly translated, can be directly traced to the
                                regulations not being in force.</p>
                            <p>While I stated, at our last session, that in my opinion the strictly
                                correct procedure for the Conference to pursue with respect to the
                                regulations, would be to put them in effect and then listen to and
                                decide <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0034"/>upon any protests
                                which might be made by either of the parties, I do not, at this
                                meeting, propose such action but may do so soon.</p>
                            <p>During the last several months, many of the mediatory delegates,
                                including myself, often have expressed their grave concern
                                respecting troop movements in the Chaco and the purchase of arms and
                                munitions by the ex-belligerents. Repeatedly, I have stated my
                                preoccupation that, under present conditions, Bolivian and
                                Paraguayan troop units might come in contact along the intermediary
                                line, thus making it possible, if not probable, that some incident
                                would occur leading to a renewal of hostilities. It is well-nigh
                                impossible to apportion responsibility in such cases, but that such
                                incidents can generate a major conflict is proven by the last
                                war.</p>
                            <p>Hence, in view of the deeply disturbing news received today, I am
                                compelled to advise the Conference that unless all troops are
                                removed from the area within the lines of withdrawal, I shall, in
                                duty bound, have to recommend to my government that it discontinue
                                its moral guarantee given in the January 21 Protocolized Act.</p>
                            <p>I submit that there is no reason why Chapter II of the regulations
                                should not immediately be put in effect. In order that this may be
                                done, I move that Captain Vacca and, if possible, Colonel Trabal be
                                despatched to the Chaco, not later than the 4th instant, by
                                airplane, with instructions that, together with the Military
                                Observers in Villa Montes, they put Chapter II of the regulations in
                                force. Furthermore, I request that this airplane be employed by the
                                aforesaid officers, to fly over all of the zone comprehended between
                                the lines of withdrawal, in order to check and make certain that all
                                troops actually have been removed from that area.</p>
                            <p>My motion is before the Conference.</p>

                        <p>127. From Braden. My despatch No. 474, August 4 and letters to Welles
                            July 29 and August 5.<note n="16" xml:id="d10fn16">Letters not found in

                            Saavedra Lamas and Ramírez. I am discontinuing the tactics described in

                            since together with results obtained from <hi rend="italic">El

                        <p>Saavedra Lamas admits Justo has demanded solution of Chaco question
                            during present administration. If possible final treaty to <pb n="25"

                            international bridge at Uruguayana. The Foreign Minister for the first
                            time in many months declares his firm belief that the final treaty can
                            be reached by direct negotiations within the Conference. The idea of
                            passing the problem to the World Court has been sidetracked at least
                            temporarily.</p>

                            the effect that the Paraguayan Government is planning to make a move in
                            the immediate future at the Chaco Conference to annul the security
                            regulations, the Protocol of June 9 and the statement issued by the
                            Conference on September 16.<note n="17" xml:id="d11fn17">For text of the
                                Conference resolution of September 16, see <hi rend="italic">The

                            report, the proposed action would be made upon the ground that the
                            members of the military establishment of Paraguay in the so-called
                            neutral zone were determined by the action of the Conference as being
                            civilians and divorced from the control of the military authorities and
                            that consequently this created a situation not anticipated nor foreseen

                        <p>193. From Braden. Your 93, October 6, 7 p.m. No authoritative information
                            available here as to the attitude which will be assumed <pb n="26"
                                xml:id="pg_26" facs="0036"/>by new Paraguayan delegation due to
                            arrive here October 10. In that connection see my despatch 512 of
                            September 29.<note n="18" xml:id="d12fn18">Not printed.</note> However,
                            my colleagues and I are of the opinion that Paraguayans will not accept
                            the regulations; what reasons will be adduced remains to be seen. If the
                            regulations adopted April 23 are not accepted the Paraguayan delegation
                            may cooperate in drafting new ones. Should they not do so I feel the
                            Conference should by appropriate resolution place the onus on Paraguay
                            for the failure to arrive at security regulations, with corollary
                            responsibility for any unfortunate consequence their absence might
                            entail in the Chaco; the Conference thereupon demanding active
                            continuation of negotiations on the fundamental question.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian delegate prior to his departure for La Paz agreed with my
                            Brazilian colleague and me that providing active negotiations on the
                            fundamental question were actually under way his country would if
                            necessary abandon transit over the road thus removing that sore point
                            from our deliberations. [Braden.]</p>

                        <p>The Minister of Bolivia called this morning and read to me two
                            communications which he had received from his Government. The
                            communications which he was instructed to convey to me stated that the
                            Government of Bolivia was greatly disturbed by the situation within the
                            Chaco Conference; that it felt that, partly because of the constant
                            political changes in Paraguay and partly because of the ineptitude of
                            the President of the Conference, Dr. Saavedra Lamas, the Conference was
                            headed for an imminent breakdown, and that if such a breakdown took
                            place, Paraguay would immediately recommence military activities against
                            Bolivia. The Minister was instructed to request the Government of the
                            United States to take part in the creation of a bloc within the Chaco
                            Conference, to be composed of the delegates of the United States, Chile,
                            Brazil and Peru, for the purpose of working together as a unit and
                            bringing pressure to bear upon the other members of the Conference so
                            that a more speedy and satisfactory procedure would be resorted to.</p>
                        <p>In response to this request, I said that, as the Minister himself knew,
                            the American delegate was on the closest and most cooperative terms with
                            the Chilean, Brazilian, and Peruvian delegates and that he <pb n="27"
                                xml:id="pg_27" facs="0037"/>was working most harmoniously with them.
                            At the same time, however, I said the United States delegate was working
                            in perfect harmony with the Uruguayan delegate and was endeavoring to
                            the best of his ability to work in similar harmony with the President of
                            the Conference. I said that it seemed to me that the creation of any
                            such bloc as this within the Conference would immediately create
                            suspicion and friction which would result in a situation entirely
                            unfavorable towards the speedy attainment of the objectives desired. I
                            added that if any such move as this were undertaken, it would hardly
                            remain unknown to the President of the Conference, with the great
                            likelihood that when some impasse was reached the President of the
                            Conference would throw all the blame for this situation upon the nations
                            taking part in the creation of such a bloc with results that might well
                            be fatal to the Conference as a whole. The Minister said that he
                            entirely agreed with me and that he would advise his Government to that
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then went on to say that he was advised by his Government
                            that some confidential formula had been worked out by some of the
                            delegations to the Conference providing for the solution of the
                            fundamental question when this is taken up by the Conference. The
                            Minister said that his Government believed that this confidential
                            formula failed to provide for Bolivia any outlet to the Paraguay River
                            and that if this were the case, such a formula would be completely
                            unacceptable to Bolivia. I told the Minister that I was unaware of any
                            such formula and that I could not conceive that our delegate had
                            participated in such conversations without advising the Department of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>I further said to the Minister that it was my understanding that the
                            Conference was now beginning to work more actively due to the arrival of
                            the new Paraguayan delegates and to the return of Dr. Alvéstegui from
                            Bolivia. I said that I could only hope that satisfactory progress could
                            be made.</p>

                                xml:id="d14fn19">Not printed.</note> reporting upon your
                            conversation with the Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs during which
                            the latter raised the point of a possible meeting of the Presidents of
                            Argentina, Brazil, <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0038"/>Bolivia and
                            Paraguay for the purpose of discussing a possible settlement of the
                            Chaco controversy.</p>
                        <p>The Department approves, in general, of the statements you made to the
                            Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs, as set forth in the penultimate
                            paragraph of your despatch. However, you are requested, in such manner
                            as you deem appropriate, to express orally to Dr. Vaca Chávez the
                            following additional views of your Government.</p>
                        <p>In your conversation with the Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs you
                            may state that your Government concurs, in general, with the views that
                            you expressed during the previous conversation. You will add, however,
                            that the Government of the United States is of the opinion that the
                            efforts being made by the Conference to bring about a solution of the
                            controversy should not be relaxed in any manner pending the possible
                            meeting of the four presidents; but that on the contrary, there should
                            be a special effort to make further progress toward a solution. This
                            Government, of course, would heartily welcome any contribution toward a
                            final settlement that might be made as a result of the proposed
                            conference of the four presidents. It appears probable that the
                            conference organization might well be utilized in carrying out any plan
                            that the four presidents might be able to agree upon. It would be
                            valuable, therefore, to have the Conference continue its work and to be
                            in a position to take advantage of any favorable developments that arise
                            outside of the Conference.</p>
                        <p>A copy of this instruction is being transmitted to the missions at Buenos
                            Aires and Rio de Janeiro, and to Ambassador Braden.</p>

                        <p>199. From Braden. Paraguayan delegation has rejected regulations by note
                            contending in detail that several provisions are not in accord with
                            protocols and therefore require congressional ratification. The last
                            paragraph, however, indicates willingness to consider measures to
                            implement non-aggression pact so as to preserve quiet in the Chaco
                            during remaining negotiations. At my request chairman of the Paraguayan
                            delegation agreed to propose formula to accomplish this end. I expect
                            him to do so shortly. [Braden.]</p>

                        <p>98. For Braden from the Under Secretary. Your 199, October 23 noon. The
                            Paraguayan note which you refer to appears to me gravely disquieting in
                            view of the conditions which it may engender. I suggest for your
                            consideration the possibility of divorcing the consideration by the
                            Conference of the allegations of Paraguay that the regulations are not
                            in accord with the protocols and the suggestions for implementation of
                            the non-aggression pact which the Chairman of the Paraguayan delegation
                            has agreed to propose. On the first point I would assume that the
                            Conference must adopt the position that the regulations are in accord
                            with the protocol and that this subject can be discussed in a
                            conciliatory fashion with the Paraguayan delegation.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second point, that is the implementation of the
                            non-aggression pact, it would seem to be becoming more than evident that
                            direct negotiations cannot be successfully undertaken at least for a
                            considerable time to come, that is until the political situation in
                            Paraguay and in Bolivia has become far more stable than it now is. If my
                            judgment on this point is correct, the only other course left would
                            appear to be resort to the Hague court. Should resort be had to that
                            procedure, a considerable time will undoubtedly elapse until the court
                            has passed upon the case and until the two parties to the controversy
                            have accepted the award. During that period the value of a well
                            implemented non-aggression pact between Paraguay and Bolivia, negotiated
                            with the moral support of the powers composing the Chaco Conference,
                            will be very great inasmuch as it would presumably quiet tension between
                            Bolivia and Paraguay and prevent the fear of a renewed attack on one
                            side or the other.</p>
                        <p>I shall be glad to have you telegraph me what your views may be with
                            regard to the points above mentioned.</p>

                        <p>205. From Braden for the Under Secretary. Your 98, October 26, 2 p.m. I
                            agree entirely with your first paragraph which is precisely <pb n="30"
                                xml:id="pg_30" facs="0040"/>procedure I have urged Conference to
                            adopt. As a result of my motion and alarmed by the Paraguayan note the
                            Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs appointed Ruíz Moreno the
                            Brazilian delegate, the Peruvian Ambassador and myself as a committee to
                            obtain from the Paraguayan delegation chairman a satisfactory project
                            implementing the non-aggression pact. The latter has promised us to
                            present today his proposition as approved by his Government. The
                            committee warned him (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) as per last sentence of
                            first paragraph my telegram No. 193, October 7, 5 p.m., and (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) that conditions soon would be further
                            aggravated since in view of the non-existence of regulations the
                            Peruvian Ambassador had stopped his military observer from going to the
                            Chaco on October 15 as scheduled and Brazil probably would do likewise
                            November 15 thus leaving the area between the opposing armies without
                            neutral observers. The Argentine and Brazilian members of committee
                            added that this practically implied the withdrawal by the mediatory
                            Governments of their moral guarantee.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second point it may well be that even assuming optimum
                            cooperation from S. Lamas unstable political conditions especially in
                            Paraguay will make direct agreement impossible for some time to come,
                            nevertheless as indicated in my despatch No. 540 air mailed October 22
                                [<hi rend="italic">21</hi>]<note n="20" xml:id="d17fn20">Not
                                printed.</note> I am convinced not yet that a Chaco settlement
                            cannot be obtained by direct negotiations. A satisfactory implementation
                            of the non-aggression pact appears the first step in opening the way, to
                            be followed by active negotiations here, the delegate’s trips to Bolivia
                            and Paraguay and finally the united pressure of all six mediatory
                            Foreign Offices. Moreover except for two short and abortive attempts
                            during October ’35 and December ’36 there has been no discussion of the
                            boundary question within the Conference for which omission the chairman
                            is largely to blame. Therefore, the Conference cannot conscientiously
                            declare direct agreement impossible until a real effort has been made to
                            find a solution.</p>
                        <p>Protocol provides [<hi rend="italic">provision?</hi>] that Conference
                            cannot close until arbitral compromise has been concerted, might impede
                            The Hague Court taking jurisdiction and certainly would bring strong
                            Paraguayan objections if we attempted to submit the question without the
                            compromise. But even granting jurisdiction were accepted and award made
                            by the Court, Paraguay would not accept the ruling, Bolivia would try to
                            enforce it, and Paraguayan resistance would probably lead to a renewal
                            of war.</p>
                        <p>Even if we obtain from Paraguay an implementation of the non-aggression
                            pact satisfactory to Bolivia the latter probably will not agree to have
                            it continue beyond the end of the Conference unless <pb n="31"
                                xml:id="pg_31" facs="0041"/>assurances were given by Paraguay that
                            the case would go to arbitration and the award [be] accepted since
                            Bolivia fears that under the protection of a non-aggression pact
                            supported by the mediatory powers Paraguay will endeavor to maintain
                            indefinitely the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> of military

                        <p>206. From Braden for the Under Secretary of State. Add the following to
                            my 205, October 28, 9 a.m. In my opinion a final intensive drive to
                            settle the fundamental question should be made and to this end the
                            situation should be presented to the other mediatory Foreign Offices,
                            their opinions requested and a concrete program of the complete unity of
                            action laid down for the Conference. By reason of its location to and
                            detachment from conflicting problems the Department of State logically
                            should make this <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi>. As soon as we have
                            determined just what security <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> may
                            be obtained in the Chaco I shall transmit my specific recommendations in
                            this particular. [Braden.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s confidential
                            instruction No. 17 of October 20, 1937, as to a proposed conference
                            between the Presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, I
                            have the honor to report that in accordance with that instruction I had
                            a conference yesterday afternoon with Dr. Fabián Vaca Chávez, Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs, in which I presented to the Minister orally the
                            additional views of the Department as set forth in the penultimate
                            paragraph of the Department’s instruction under review.</p>
                        <p>In reply, Dr. Vaca Chávez expressed special gratification to learn that
                            the efforts being made by the Conference to bring about a solution of
                            the controversy would not be relaxed on account of any supplementary
                            efforts which might be made in the same direction in the meantime. He
                            added that Dr. Alvéstegui had been specifically <pb n="32"
                                xml:id="pg_32" facs="0042"/>instructed to further the work of the
                            Conference in every possible way. While he had not been instructed to
                            propose specific solutions, he had been authorized to accept certain
                            possible solutions in case these were proposed to him by the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Vaca Chávez went on to say that he felt very strongly that no step,
                            however hopeful, should be taken to weaken the prestige or the influence
                            of the Conference itself, and he assured me of the desire of the
                            Bolivian Government to make use of the machinery of the Conference in
                            carrying out any plan which might possibly be agreed upon in the
                            proposed conference between the four Presidents. From the tone of his
                            remarks I gathered that the whole plan was intended to be supplementary
                            and that arrangements for the proposed meeting were still tentative and
                            uncertain.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Vaca Chávez then went on to tell me that the suggestion in question
                            had come originally from Dr. Saavedra Lamas, who had mentioned the
                            matter first to Dr. Rodriguez Alves and later to Dr. Alvéstegui, who had
                            made a confidential report on the subject during his recent visit to La
                            Paz.</p>
                        <p>As to possible concrete solutions, which might perhaps be offered if a
                            suitable opportunity arose, Dr. Vaca Chávez went on to say that he had
                            been informed that Dr. Saavedra Lamas had sent Colonel Schweitzer as his
                            personal emissary to Asunción to sound out opinion in Paraguay as to a
                            reasonable territorial solution in return for a cash payment on the part
                            of Bolivia to Paraguay. At the same time Captain Mauriño had come to La
                            Paz on a similar mission. Dr. Vaca Chávez said that Captain Mauriño had
                            reported that he had not found positive evidence as to the probable
                            attitude of Bolivian opinion on this question.</p>
                        <p>As a possible alternative, Dr. Vaca Chávez added confidentially that the
                            Bolivian Government was also considering another possible solution,
                            involving the extension of the railroad from Puerto Casado to the
                            southern oil fields, with an agreement on the part of Bolivia to export
                            oil to Paraguay by this route in return for a definite territorial
                            settlement and the use of Puerto Casado as a free port on the part of
                            Bolivia, this suggestion being kept for the moment in strict reserve to
                            be used only if other suggested solutions proved to be impracticable.
                            All this Dr. Vaca Chávez told me as an indication of the desire of
                            Bolivia to seek in every possible way a prompt and equitable solution
                            under the terms of the peace protocol of June, 1935, and through the
                            machinery set up at that time.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, however, the Brazilian Legation has received
                            information which it believes to be reliable that, on his arrival in La
                            Paz, Captain Mauriño went to President Busch and to two high officers of
                            the Army (Peñaranda and Calleja) with a personal message <pb n="33"
                                xml:id="pg_33" facs="0043"/>from Dr. Saavedra Lamas, suggesting a
                            direct arrangement between Paraguay, Bolivia and the Argentine as the
                            only practicable solution of the Chaco problem.</p>

                        <p>102. For Braden from the Under Secretary. Your 205, October 28, 9 a.m.,
                            and 206, October 28, 11 a.m. The exchange of views effected in my
                            telegram 98, October 26, 2 p.m., and your telegrams under reference make
                            it appear desirable for our delegation to support conference action
                            along the following lines: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>It appears that the Paraguayan delegation should be tactfully
                                    informed, in reply to the note mentioned in your 199, October
                                    23, noon, that the Conference cannot decide otherwise than that,

                                    attention of the Paraguayan delegation, the Conference should
                                    express, in a conciliatory manner, its willingness to discuss
                                    with the Paraguayan or Bolivian delegations any clarification of
                                    the existing security regulations that may be considered
                                    necessary by either of the two parties.</item>

                                <item>The mediatory powers might well be urged to continue to send
                                    their military observers to the Chaco, at least during the time
                                    that a further effort is being made to adjust the matter of the
                                    security regulations. While failure to keep observers in the
                                    Chaco might imply a withdrawal by the mediatory powers of their
                                    moral guarantee, as stated by the Argentine and Brazilian
                                    delegates, it also might be interpreted as meaning that the
                                    Conference has given in to Paraguay as concerns jurisdiction
                                    over security measures. In the event that Paraguay makes it
                                    impossible for the military observers to carry out their
                                    instructions from the Conference, consideration then might be
                                    given to making public a conference resolution which would
                                    provide for the withdrawal of the observers and which would set
                                    forth the reasons for such action. The Paraguayan delegation
                                    might be informally apprised of this contemplated
                                    procedure.</item>

                                <item>It seems highly desirable that the Conference should press the
                                    negotiation of a well implemented non-aggression pact
                                    concurrently with its work on the fundamental issue. The
                                    negotiation of such a <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0044"
                                    />pact, however, should be entirely divorced from a
                                    consideration of the present security regulations; and it should
                                    be made clear that a rapid adjustment respecting the
                                    regulations, on the basis of conference jurisdiction, is the
                                    most important immediate problem.</item>

                        <p>In your opinion, is the Brazilian statement of October 8, reported in
                            your despatch 539,<note n="23" xml:id="d20fn23">Dated October 20; not
                                printed.</note> in accord with the procedure outlined in paragraph
                            (4)? There is some indication that the Brazilian plan would be to drop
                            the question of the existing regulations in the event that Paraguay
                            refuses to accept the regulations as they are. The Brazilian delegate
                            went on to say that should Paraguay refuse, the Conference would be
                            faced by the necessity of rapidly establishing a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> guaranteeing security in the Chaco and acceptable to
                            Bolivia. If the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> referred to would
                            represent merely a modification of the existing regulations and would be
                            based upon conference jurisdiction in the matter, then the views of
                            Brazil and the United States are approximately the same.</p>
                        <p>I am considering the views expressed in the second and third paragraphs
                            of your telegram 205; and I have noted that the comment about General
                            Estigarribia, set forth in paragraph 8 of your despatch 541,<note n="24"
                                xml:id="d20fn24">Dated October 21; not printed.</note> indicates the
                            possibility that his moderate views may yet prove of assistance in
                            reaching a direct settlement of the Chaco controversy. However, I wish
                            to give further study to the alternate courses of continued effort for
                            direct settlement or resort to The Hague court before reaching a
                            definite decision in the matter.</p>
                        <p>You may, in your discretion, discuss paragraphs (1) to (4) of this
                            telegram with the mediatory delegates, with a view to bringing about
                            unity of action by the Conference.</p>

                        <p>212. From Braden for the Under Secretary. On October 29 the Brazilian
                            delegate received telegram from his Foreign Office quoting report from
                            Brazilian Minister at La Paz that the Argentine Military Attaché there
                            had declared to President Busch, Chief of Staff, and other prominent
                            officers he was authorized to give them to understand that Saavedra
                            Lamas being convinced the final treaty could not be <pb n="35"
                                xml:id="pg_35" facs="0045"/>reached by the Peace Conference
                            suggested doing away with it thus leaving negotiations to Argentina as
                            sole mediator.</p>
                        <p>Brazilian delegate was further informed yesterday the source was Bolivian
                            Minister in Brazil now in La Paz, confirmed by Under Secretary for
                            Foreign Affairs. I have requested confirmation from Caldwell.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Military Attaché may have exceeded his instructions but
                            under any circumstances the incident is serious if confirmed. As soon as
                            we are satisfied of the facts my Brazilian colleague and I will consult
                            as to what action we can recommend. [Braden.]</p>

                        <p>213. From Braden. Department’s telegram No. 102, November 4, 7 p.m.
                            Paraguayan project which was delayed by illness of Paraguayan Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs and attempted revolution<note n="25"

                            delivered to Committee today. It does not cover transit but otherwise
                            through generalities attempts to accomplish the same ends as the
                            regulations of April 23. Committee discussions thereof will begin
                            tomorrow with ex-belligerent delegations.</p>
                        <p>Paraguayan delegation has already been informed as per paragraphs 1 and 2
                            of telegram under reference.</p>
                        <p>Brazilian October 8th statement is in accord with paragraph 4 of telegram
                            under reference excepting that it contemplates only present security
                            regulations or in lieu thereof a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                            which will protect the situation in the Chaco until the termination of
                            the Conference but it does not suggest or contemplate a permanent well
                            implemented non-aggression pact.</p>
                        <p>I expect that during Committee discussions during the next few days we
                            will arrive at a concrete plan as to exactly what may be accomplished in
                            the way of present security measures in the Chaco.</p>
                        <p>The considerations advanced in my despatch 546,<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d22fn26">Dated October 28; not printed.</note> in my
                            opinion, make it preferable that the stand outlined in your telegram
                            under reference be made a part of the suggested <hi rend="italic"
                                >démarche</hi> by the Department incorporating it as point 3 of my
                            outline. I have reason to believe that Foreign Offices of Chile, Brazil
                            and Peru agree substantially with the Department’s views. Uruguay is an
                            unknown quantity and <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0046"/>is not to be
                            relied on. But chances of getting the chairman committed to a definite
                            course of action will be greater following the Department’s <hi
                                rend="italic">démarche</hi> than if I were to present the program in

                        <p>114. For Braden from the Under Secretary. The Bolivian Minister called
                            upon me today by instruction of his Government to inform me that the
                            Bolivian Government had been giving consideration to the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> proposed and had found it
                            unacceptable inasmuch as it contained material departures from the bases
                            of the January regulations. I expressed to the Minister my hope that the
                            Bolivian Government in its reply to the Conference would not tender a
                            flat rejection of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> but would
                            give every possible consideration to the possibility of making such
                            counter proposals as it deemed necessary within the framework of the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> as formulated. The Minister stated
                            he would advise his Government accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Please cable the Department any representations in this regard which may
                            have already been made to you or to the Conference by the Bolivian
                            delegation.</p>

                        <p>235. From Braden. Your 114, November 30, 7 p.m. No reply to the
                            Conference has been made yet by Bolivia but the delegate rather favors
                            rejecting <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> hoping thus to emphasize
                            Paraguayan insubordination to protocols as these are interpreted by the
                            Conference in contrast with Bolivian orthodoxy. The Brazilian delegate
                            and I have repeatedly pointed out that the <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> is not equivalent to the bases and regulations but is a
                            means of achieving minimum security required in the Chaco for the life
                            of the Conference. Strongly recommending acceptance we have contended
                            that Bolivia’s juridicial position will be protected by the projected
                            Conference reply to the Paraguayan October 20 note and she could further
                            clarify it in a note addressed to the Conference; Bolivian position
                            would also be strengthened by being conciliatory once again.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            No. 212 of November 6, 3 p.m. concerning statements attributed to Major
                            Mauriño, Argentine Military Attaché in La Paz, to the effect that Dr.
                            Saavedra Lamas desired the elimination of the other mediatory nations so
                            that Argentina could act alone. The Bolivian delegate yesterday advised
                            Ambassador Rodrigues Alves and me that he had received a telegram from
                            his government confirming the Mauriño story.</p>
                        <p>In that connection, on the evening of November 25, Sr. Carcano, Argentine
                            Ambassador in Rio de Janeiro, confidentially advised the Brazilian
                            delegate, Ambassador Rodrigues Alves, that he had warned the Argentine
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs that Argentine policy on the destroyer
                                incident<note n="28" xml:id="d26fn28">See despatch No. 1710, August
                                20, 1937, from the Ambassador in Argentina, <ref target="#pg_246">p.

                            Brazil and cause that country’s withdrawal from the Peace Conference.
                            The Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that he did not mind
                            in the slightest degree if Brazil and all the other mediatory powers
                            withdrew but would indeed welcome it, since he had agreed with the
                            Paraguayans that negotiations might be pursued with Argentina <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0048"/>as the sole mediator. I believe
                            allowance should be made for Ambassador Cárcano’s strong antipathy for
                            Dr. Saavedra Lamas; Dr. Zubizarreta and his colleagues have shown no
                            such disposition as attributed to them by the Conference president.</p>
                        <p>I am reliably informed that Major Tauber, Argentine Military Attaché in
                            Asunción made a hurried and secret trip into the Chaco a couple of weeks
                            ago and thereafter immediately came to Buenos Aires. One naturally
                            wonders if his mission was not similar to that of his fellow officer in
                            La Paz.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Zubizarreta, Paraguayan delegate, advised me confidentially on
                            November 27 that he had been summoned a few days before by the Argentine
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs to a meeting with Major Mauriño who, among
                            other indiscretions, said that Bolivia, being anxious for a final
                            treaty, was willing to pay a large sum of money to Paraguay and no
                            longer desired a sovereign port. Dr. Saavedra Lamas injected the
                            remark—“No paltry sum but many millions”. While I believe the Bolivian
                            government will be willing, in the final showdown, to put up money and
                            forego a sovereign port if it obtains an otherwise satisfactory
                            agreement, to pass this information on to the Paraguayans at this time
                            can only make our negotiations with them more difficult. Major Mauriño,
                            supported by the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs, also told the
                            Paraguayan delegate that they could obtain a frontier, for at least a
                            short distance, along the Parapiti river. The Bolivians have always
                            declared they preferred war to making such a concession.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs naturally tried to keep secret
                            the Mauriño mission. When he found he could not do so, and that his
                            personal efforts to settle the Chaco singlehanded were not as successful
                            as he had hoped, he produced Major Mauriño at the Conference session of
                            November 26, that the other delegates might be enlightened by him on his
                            mission in Bolivia. Among other statements, Major Mauriño said that the
                            Bolivian government would be willing to put up between 10,000,000 and
                            15,000,000 pesos, Argentine currency. The maximum sum ever discussed
                            previously had been £200,000 or approximately 3,350,000 Argentine
                            pesos.</p>
                        <p>The importance of this affair lies in the fact that there is confirmation
                            that Major Mauriño, under orders from Dr. Saavedra Lamas, did interview
                            high Bolivian officials with a proposal to torpedo the Conference. He
                            was unsuccessful since the Bolivian officials replied their country
                            preferred the Conference. It is the role of Charity to suppose that
                            Major Mauriño exceeded his instructions. On the other hand the Argentine
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs’ statement to his Ambassador in Rio de
                            Janeiro that the Paraguayans were agreeable to his idea of Argentina
                            proceeding alone in the mediation was written only <pb n="39"
                                xml:id="pg_39" facs="0049"/>a short time before Major Mauriño was
                            sent to La Paz and therefore strong presumption exists that he acted
                            under orders.</p>
                        <p>I have thoroughly discussed this matter with Ambassador Rodrigues Alves
                            and we are of opinion that nothing can be done by us in the premises
                            without seriously endangering the Conference. It appears best to leave
                            that Mauriño incident where it is and to ignore this last intrigue by
                            Dr. Saavedra Lamas as we have others.</p>

                            submitted general preliminary bases for a final peace treaty to Dr.
                            Zubizarreta and Dr. Cardozo, Paraguayan delegates, and obtained their
                            promise to make us informally a counter proposal which, while
                            undoubtedly presenting their maximum aspirations, nevertheless will
                            follow the broad lines laid down by us and which, from conversations

                        <p>With respect to these bases the following comments may be made:</p>
                        <p>1. Bolivia still insists officially that a sovereign port on the Paraguay
                            river is a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> to any final agreement.
                            The Bolivian <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0050"/>delegate has,
                            however, confidentially advised my Brazilian colleague and myself that
                            his government will accept a free port providing the other terms of the
                            treaty are satisfactory. It is evident that Bolivia desires a free port
                            in the full sense of the word without any restrictions and including the
                            installation of their own customs. Paraguay, on the other hand, wishes
                            free port facilities to be limited, so that while there would be no
                            Paraguayan taxes or duties imposed upon the transit of people and
                            material through the port, there would not be a Bolivian customs office
                            and Paraguay would retain a certain degree of supervision in the free
                            port area. This is essentially a detail to be worked out in
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>2. The Paraguayans will unquestionably at first insist upon a frontier
                            lying along the intermediary line and that any withdrawal to the east or
                            south of that line should be compensated for by an approximately equal
                            area to the north or west. On this point we will encounter our greatest
                            difficulties. However, yesterday we proposed the following line to the
                            Paraguayans: Starting at the intersection of longitude 61º with the
                            Pilcomayo river, north through Fortín Esteros, northwest to Cañada
                            Tarija, northeast to Ingavi and east to the intersection of latitude
                            20º–0′–35″ with the river Otuquis. As was to be expected, the
                            Paraguayans were shocked at the suggestion of such a boundary. Dr.
                            Zubizarreta intimated that we should at least propose a line
                            approximating that mentioned in paragraph 6 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            of my despatch No. 482.</p>
                        <p>3. The Bolivian delegate has indicated to Ambassador Rodrigues Alves and
                            me that his country, providing other conditions are satisfactory, would
                            be willing to construct a railroad from the Camiri area to Puerto Casado
                            and even to contemplate some participation by Paraguay in the oil
                            industry of southeastern Bolivia. Yesterday Dr. Zubizarreta held that
                            the portion of the railroad within Paraguayan territory should be
                            constructed and owned by the Paraguayan government and that, to this
                            end, Bolivia should pay to Paraguay the requisite amount of money,
                            leaving to the latter to decide when railroad construction should begin.
                            It is interesting, in this connection, that whenever the building of a
                            railroad in the Chaco has been mentioned, Dr. Saavedra Lamas has
                            endeavored to have the route to run from Puerto Casado to Yacuiba, thus
                            effectually furnishing Argentina with a strategic line in the Chaco.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, a railroad from Camiri to Puerto Casado might substantially
                            reduce the value of the proposed Argentine railroad from Yacuiba to
                            Santa Cruz and it would probably greatly lessen, if not eliminate,
                            Argentina’s interest in Bolivian oil, excepting for that in the Bermejo
                            region, and thus might indirectly make Bolivia more disposed towards
                            some mutually satisfactory settlement with the Standard Oil Company.</p>
                        <p>4 and 5. I doubt that there will be any difficulty encountered on these
                            points, providing an agreement can be reached upon the first three.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing plan is, of course, vague and preliminary, but at least
                            seems to offer an opportunity to bring the ex-belligerent nations
                            together on the fundamental elements for discussion and to afford
                            satisfactory starting points for the territorial-boundary
                                deliberations.<pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0051"/>In fact, I
                            would feel quite optimistic respecting these negotiations were it not
                            for Dr. Saavedra Lamas’ ignorance of the Chaco problem, his gross
                            indiscretions and intrigues, plus the fact that he categorically refuses
                            to permit the formation of any Conference committee or to allow any
                            meetings whatsoever of delegates without his presence, even though one
                            of the other Argentine representatives attend. In other words, he makes
                            it impossible for us to adopt an intensive, intelligent procedure such
                            as was followed successfully by the Prisoners Committee and which both
                            the ex-belligerent delegates agree is the only satisfactory way to work.
                            Until he is out of the way our only course seems to be to make such
                            progress as we can through “prohibited” meetings analogous to the one
                            held yesterday, despite the deliberate obstruction of the Conference
                            president.</p>

                            <p>At a time when it appears that the fundamental negotiations may be
                                begun with some hope of success, for the Conference to accuse
                                Paraguay of insubordination and to place the responsibility on that
                                country for any incidents which might occur in the Chaco would not
                                be in keeping with the role of a mediator and might prejudice the
                                success of our final negotiations. Therefore, providing Bolivia’s
                                juridical position in this security question can be entirely
                                protected and providing that no serious incidents occur in the

                                    vivendi</hi> cover the question of withdrawal of troops by
                                fixing certain concentration points for them. The limitation of
                                number of troops is also provided for in the limited number to be
                                allowed in the “destacamentos”.</p>
                            <p>The third and fourth points similarly are covered in the <hi
                                    rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> and Dr. Zubizarreta has assured
                                the Conference committee with whom he negotiated that the fifth
                                point could readily be handled by the Military Observers in
                                consultation with the commands in the Chaco.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, while there is no equivalence between the April 23
                                Regulations and the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, and the
                                latter document admittedly does not clearly define matters by laying
                                down “lines of withdrawal”, specifying the exact number of police to
                                be allowed within the area, etc., nevertheless the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >modus vivendi</hi>, if carried out in the spirit as well as in
                                the letter, will prevent all contact between Bolivian and Paraguayan
                                posts or patrols and accomplish the same ends as the Regulations.
                                There is every incentive for Paraguay to comply with the <pb n="43"
                                    xml:id="pg_43" facs="0053"/>spirit as well as the letter of the
                                    <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> and Dr. Zubizarreta has
                                assured the mediatory delegates that in actual practice the
                                provisions of the April 23 Regulations will be carried out. That is
                                to say, the Military Observers, in consultation with the commands,
                                will locate concentration points behind the lines of withdrawal or
                                separation. “Destacamentos” similarly will be placed at ample
                                distances from one another and will be limited in number to probably
                                less than the 500 police allowed in the Regulations. Furthermore,
                                Dr. Zubizarreta declares that every liberty of transit will be given
                                over the Villa Montes-Boyuibe road.</p>
                            <p>Both Bolivia and the Conference repeatedly have emphasized the urgent
                                need for a security system in the Chaco (see Dr. Alvéstegui’s note,
                                August 5, 1937<note n="30" xml:id="d28fn30">Not found in Department
                                    files.</note>); hence, for Bolivia now to leave matters in their
                                present status would indicate that previous insistence on
                                implantation of a security system was unwarranted and would make
                                both Bolivia and the Conference appear as having been unduly
                                alarmist.</p>
                            <p>In any event, as long as Bolivia’s juridical position is fully
                                protected, it is certainly worth while giving the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >modus vivendi</hi> a trial, since, if it is found impracticable
                                it can readily be cancelled and the situation returned to the status
                                of October 20 without detriment to the prestige plus the fact that
                                Bolivia, by acceding to the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> on
                                this trial basis, would once again have demonstrated cooperation and
                                an earnest desire for peace which could not do otherwise than
                                strengthen that country’s position before the world at large and, in
                                particular before the Hague Court if, as and when the question were
                                ever presented there.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            informal conversations reported in my despatch No. 574 of December 3,
                            1937 have continued between Ambassador Rodrigues Alves, Brazilian
                            delegate, Ambassador Barreda Laos, Peruvian delegate, and myself on the
                            one hand, and the Paraguayan delegation on the other.</p>
                        <p>On December 6 Dr. Zubizarreta, senior Paraguayan delegate, made us the
                            following offer: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>1). That the permanent frontier should coincide with the
                                    intermediary line. 2) That any territory in Paraguay’s
                                    possession, such as that in the neighborhood of the Villa
                                    Montes-Boyuibe road, which were relinquished should be
                                    compensated by an area to the north of <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44"
                                        facs="0054"/>the intermediary line, in which case they
                                    proposed the following frontier: Cururenda (opposite
                                    D’Orbigny)—up the middle of the Pilcomayo river to Palo
                                    Marcado—north through Carandaiti (leaving Carandaiti in
                                    Paraguayan possession) to Santa Fé on the Parapiti
                                    river—following the course of this river to its intersection
                                    with latitude 19º 10 S.—a straight line to San Juan—south
                                    following the course of the Otuquis and Rio Negro rivers until
                                    their junction with the Paraguay river. (In the course of this
                                    meeting Dr. Zubizarreta read to us his confidential instructions
                                    issued by President Ayala in June, 1935 which assert the
                                    intermediary line is the minimum acceptable to Paraguay and the
                                    maximum line beginning at Yaurá (Brazil)—south to the
                                    Pilcomayo—Pilcomayo to D’Orbigny-Juntas del Pilar—headwaters of
                                    the Pilcomayo in the Chiriguanos mountains—headwaters of the
                                    Parapiti—following the Parapiti to the Izozog marshes).</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Dr. Rodrigues Alves, Dr. Barreda Laos and I declared the above offer to
                            be totally inacceptable even as a starting point and we insisted that
                            the intermediary line be the maximum of Paraguayan aspirations and a
                            frontier on the Parapiti to be unthinkable. (Bolivia would prefer
                            another war to such a condition). Also we refused to improve upon the
                            Esteros line proposed by us (See paragraph 2, page 3 of my despatch No.
                            574).</p>
                        <p>Dr. Zubizarreta said that he had exceeded his instructions by making the
                            offer described in paragraph 2 of this despatch and, to break the
                            deadlock, suggested that Dr. Cardozo, junior Paraguayan delegate, should
                            go to Asunción, discuss the matter with the President of Paraguay and
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and bring back specific and full
                            instructions. By arrangement with the Argentine government, Dr. Cardozo
                            will be allowed to go through the yellow fever quarantine on Paraguayan
                            ports. He leaves for Asunción today.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Ramírez, former Paraguayan delegate, also returns to Asunción today
                            to present a detailed report of his work here. He claims to have
                            documents signed, or at least initialed, by Dr. Carlos Macedo Soares,
                            former Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs, showing that during
                            December, 1936 the Conference agreed to a frontier along the Parapiti
                            river for Paraguay. I doubt the existence of such evidence, but even if
                            true it proves nothing beyond a <hi rend="italic">lapsus memoria</hi> on
                            Dr. Macedo’s part. In order, however, that Dr. Cardozo might be fully
                            informed and be in a position to disabuse his Government of any such
                            aspirations, I have read to him the pertinent portions of my despatch
                            #353 of January 14, 1937,<note n="31" xml:id="d29fn31">Not
                                printed.</note> describing the discussions of the Committee of Three
                            with Dr. Stefanich.</p>
                        <p>As stated in item (2) page 3 of my despatch #540 of October 21,
                                1937,<note n="31" xml:id="d29fn32">Not printed.</note> the
                            Paraguayan delegation’s instructions in October were not to negotiate on
                            the fundamental question; also their intransigence <pb n="45"
                                xml:id="pg_45" facs="0055"/>was augmented by the false hopes given
                            them by Dr. Saavedra Lamas. Nevertheless, some progress has been made
                            since Dr. Zubizarreta, during the last two weeks, has at least discussed
                            a final settlement with us and has made the above described offer for a
                            permanent frontier.</p>
                        <p>This morning, in a final talk with him, I frankly warned Dr. Cardozo that
                            if Paraguay would escape responsibility for the breakdown of the
                            Conference, he must return from Asuncíon with a much better proposition
                            than that offer. He argued that Paraguay juridically was entitled to
                            stay on the intermediary line. I told him the mediatory delegates
                            unanimously disagreed with that thesis, but leaving the legalities for
                            my colleagues to discuss, he and his government must look at the
                            realities—not what Bolivia would get but what Paraguay would have in
                            contrast with prewar conditions; by ceding some of the occupied
                            territory they could obtain a permanent peace highly advantageous to
                            them from every aspect. I went into the economic, military, logistic and
                            other commonsense phases of the situation in detail and admonished him
                            at parting that: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) If Paraguay insists on the
                            intermediary line as a permanent frontier, the Conference will fail and
                            another war become inevitable; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) If Paraguay as
                            a starting point for the direct negotiations will ask for the
                            intermediary line as the maximum boundary but with a withdrawal eastward
                            of 15 to 20 kilometres in the vicinity of the Villa Montes-Boyuibe road,
                            then I believed the parties could gradually be brought into closer
                            approximation; and a permanent frontier could be negotiated or left for
                            arbitration to be located somewhere between that maximum and the Fortín
                            Esteros line proposed by the Brazilian and Peruvian delegates and
                            myself. Dr. Cardozo promised to present faithfully my views to President
                            Paiva and other authorities in Asuncion. He said he appreciated the
                            responsibility which rested upon him and the Paraguayan government and
                            was, personally, 90% plus in agreement with me. It remains to be seen
                            whether the Paraguayan government and delegation will have the courage
                            to face the facts and negotiate along the reasonable lines described on
                            page 2 of my despatch #574. We should be able, fairly accurately, to
                            size up the prospects shortly after Dr. Cardozo’s return from Asuncón,
                            now scheduled for December 27.</p>

                                may be able to take some action in the present impasse in the
                                boundary negotiations. He is convinced that without such action the
                                negotiations will fail and that a situation then will develop which
                                will threaten peace in South America.</p>

                                conversations between Mr. Fletcher, then Under Secretary of State,
                                and the Ecuadoran Minister, Mr. Elizalde.</p>

                            <p>The Ecuadoran Minister called about ten days prior to January 31,
                                1922 (apparently it was on January 9, 1922), to inquire informally
                                how the United States would regard an effort on the part of his
                                Government to settle the Ecuadoran-Peruvian boundary dispute along
                                the same lines as were then being followed with regard to the
                                Peruvian-Chilean controversy. Mr. Fletcher stated in part as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“I then told him that the Department was not prepared to give
                                        any expression of opinion at that time; that I was not
                                        familiar with the details of the controversy, and asked him
                                        to give me a memorandum of just how the matter stood and
                                        what his Government proposed to do. I intimated strongly,
                                        however, my personal opinion to the effect that the
                                        Ecuadoran Government should not complicate the situation at
                                        that time—which was before Peru had accepted the President’s
                                        invitation—(presumably the invitation to participate in the

                            <p>The Ecuadoran Minister never submitted a memorandum since his
                                Government stated that it had no concrete plans at that time. On
                                January 31 he called again to see Mr. Fletcher, suggesting that Peru
                                and Ecuador appoint representatives in Washington for the purpose of
                                arranging for the settlement of their boundary dispute. Mr. Fletcher
                                stated in reply, <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“I informed him that we would take note of this and, while I
                                        could not make any expression which would indicate any
                                        intention or desire on our part to interfere in the matter
                                        now or at any future time in any way, he could say to his
                                        Government that if an arrangement of their difficulties
                                        satisfactory to both Governments could be reached this
                                        Government would be very gratified thereat.”</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft">Mr. Elizalde then insinuated “that arbitration of
                                the difficulties by the United States would be, from our position
                                and prestige in this hemisphere, et cetera, welcomed by his
                                Government.” Mr. Fletcher stated in reply, “I made clear that I
                                could not discuss even the possibility of the United States acting
                                as arbitrator,” and in answer to the complimentary things which Mr.
                                Elizalde had to say about the United States and the feeling that an
                                American arbitrator would render a just decision, Mr. Fletcher
                                stated in his memorandum: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“I again declined to consider this phase of the question and

                                        the move which his Government had made looking toward a
                                        settlement of this question by direct approach to the
                                        Government of Peru. I told him that we would take due note
                                        of what he had had to say.”</p>

                                Minister to his Government, and indicated the confidence of his

                            <p>25. The President has informed me of the receipt of a note from Peru
                                formally charging a breach of neutrality by the entry of Ecuadorian
                                    <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0059"/>troops in the Zarumilla
                                neutral zone and adding that orders have been issued to repel by
                                force any future incursions. The Ecuadorian Minister in Lima has
                                been instructed to deny categorically this assertion.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed the foregoing. He is most
                                perturbed over the situation and expressed the fear that any
                                untoward incident in that district might be the cause of immediate
                                hostilities. Inasmuch as the allegation is groundless it is
                                interpreted as the forerunner to breaking off the negotiations in
                                Washington.</p>
                            <p>The attitude of the President is most dangerous to peace in the
                                Americas. He considers the negotiations fruitless and apparently is
                                prepared to terminate them. He is even contemplating hostilities
                                notwithstanding that he recognizes Peru’s superior strength and
                                resources and anticipates Ecuador’s defeat, Regardless of these
                                considerations he has convinced himself that armed conflict is the
                                only alternative.</p>
                            <p>The President expressed the belief that the Department is preventing
                                President Roosevelt from taking any positive action in the present
                                impasse. He regrets this since without the President’s influence he
                                considers that the negotiations must fail and that relations may be
                                ruptured immediately thereafter.</p>

                            <p>I asked the Ambassador of Ecuador to call upon me this morning and
                                communicated to him the contents of the telegram sent to the
                                Department by the American Minister in Quito under date of June 9, 6
                                p.m.</p>
                            <p>I explained to the Ambassador that I was very seriously preoccupied
                                with the information transmitted and particularly by the impressions
                                Mr. Gonzalez had communicated to me of the attitude and
                                understanding of the position taken by this Government which were
                                alleged to exist on the part of President Páez.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the allegation that, “The Department of State is
                                preventing President Roosevelt from taking any positive action in
                                the present impasse”, I said that, of course, the Ambassador knew
                                better than I did what a strange misapprehension this was; that, as
                                he knew, President Roosevelt was deeply interested in the successful
                                termination of the negotiations between Peru and Ecuador for the
                                solution of the boundary dispute; that he had himself addressed the
                                two delegations, expressing his hope that an early agreement <pb
                                    n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0060"/>would be found, and that he
                                had referred to the controversy in public addresses—in one of them
                                made not long ago. I said that the President felt very strongly
                                exactly as the Secretary of State and I felt that, in view of the
                                fact that the President was named in the protocol between Peru and
                                Ecuador as the contingent arbitrator of the dispute, he must be
                                scrupulously careful to avoid taking any action which would give
                                rise to the unfounded impressions that he was bringing pressure to
                                bear on one or the other of the parties to the dispute. I said that
                                President Roosevelt was animated solely by a spirit of equal and
                                warm friendship for both countries and because of his passionate
                                desire to see peace maintained upon firm foundations on the American
                                continent. In so far as the belief had been expressed that the
                                Department of State is influencing President Roosevelt counter to
                                his own inclinations, I said to the Ambassador that I knew, from his
                                personal acquaintance with the President, that he would know that
                                President Roosevelt would be guided solely by what he himself
                                thought right and in this instance the President was confident that
                                the stand he had taken was the one which would prove most helpful in
                                the settlement of the controversy.</p>
                            <p>In so far as our desire to be helpful was concerned, I reminded the
                                Ambassador that he knew from my prior conversations with him of the
                                talks I had had with Ambassador Concha<note n="8" xml:id="d35fn8"
                                    >Carlos Concha, Peruvian Ambassador in Chile and former Minister
                                    for Foreign Affairs, had made a trip to the United States in
                                    1936.</note> during the latter’s recent visit to Washington. I
                                said that I found Dr. Concha, here as in Buenos Aires, a sincere
                                lover of peace, a very moderate minded and practical statesman, and
                                that I knew from what he had said to me that Dr. Concha desired the
                                negotiations in Washington to succeed. Dr. Concha had returned from
                                Washington to Lima, had conferred with President Benavides; and I
                                felt sure that his wise judgment would be given great importance by
                                the President of Peru. I told the Ambassador further that it was
                                generally reported in Lima that a new civilian government would soon
                                be constituted in Peru and that there was considerable feeling that
                                Dr. Concha himself would head this new government.</p>
                            <p>In view of all of these facts, I asked the Ambassador if he would not
                                consider it peculiarly deplorable at this very moment, when the
                                prospects seemed brighter than they have for some months past, for
                                his Government to consider breaking off negotiations or even to
                                contemplate hostilities. That, I said, was an inquiry which I made
                                because of my friendship for him and for his country and from the
                                standpoint of the interest of Ecuador itself. Another inquiry which
                                I felt was not inappropriate was how it would be possible for the
                                Government of Ecuador, after the peace treaties which it had signed
                                    <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0061"/>at the Buenos Aires

                                    (Washington, Government Printing Office, 1937).</note> and in
                                view of the unanimous desire on the part of all of the American
                                republics there expressed always to resort to peaceful means of
                                adjudicating disputes, now to contemplate hostilities when no act of
                                aggression had been committed against Ecuador by Peru. I said that I
                                was afraid that if other important governments of the American
                                continent, like Ecuador, were to take such a step as this, public
                                opinion throughout the continent would rapidly begin to feel that
                                all that the American delegations at Buenos Aires had given to the
                                cause of peace was mere lip service and of no practical benefit.</p>
                            <p>Finally, I reminded the Ambassador that, inasmuch as the Government
                                of Peru had specifically stated in her reservations to the various
                                peace instruments in Buenos Aires that she would not regard the
                                pending boundary controversy with Ecuador as within the scope and
                                jurisdiction of any of the peace treaties and conventions there
                                signed, the only machinery in existence for the peaceful settlement
                                of the boundary dispute were the protocols of 1924<note n="10"

                                and the negotiations now proceeding in Washington. If Ecuador
                                withdrew from these negotiations, what peaceful means would be left
                                for the solution of the controversy?</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that he would at once cable his Government along
                                the lines of our conversation and would follow up this cable by an
                                air mail letter to President Páez, in which he would go into great
                                detail. He said that he felt that Mr. Gonzalez had probably
                                unintentionally exaggerated and given the wrong color to the remarks
                                which may have been made to him by President Páez. He said that, of
                                course, his Government had been gravely disturbed by the allegations
                                publicly made by Peru and was always fearful of a sudden rupture
                                which would give rise to armed hostilities. He said, however, that
                                he was confident that the Government of Ecuador would never make the
                                first move. The Ambassador said further that he had consistently
                                advised his Government never to be the first to break negotiations
                                in Washington since these negotiations were the only definite
                                guarantee which Ecuador could have for an eventual satisfactory
                                settlement.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador, as always, was most appreciative of the attitude
                                which we took. He said that he fully understood the attitude assumed
                                by President Roosevelt, which he believed the only possible and only
                                truly helpful attitude; and that one of his own chief difficulties
                                    <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0062"/>was the fact that the
                                Ecuadoran delegates to the negotiations at Washington did not know
                                American psychology nor understand the way in which they could be
                                most helpful to their Government, and persisted in the belief that
                                they must every day try to print in the newspapers attacks upon Peru
                                or defenses of the Ecuadoran position.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I said that I felt the Ambassador knew us so well that
                                there was no advice that I could give him as to how to deal with
                                American public opinion. I stated finally that it was particularly
                                regrettable that this incident had now arisen because I knew from
                                our own Embassy in Lima that the opinion of the Peruvian Government
                                towards the Government of Ecuador had become far more friendly and
                                favorable as a result of the refusal of the Government of Ecuador
                                last month to permit the Ecuadoran press to publish articles written
                                by Aprista refugees attacking the President of Peru and the members
                                of his administration.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said he would keep me closely in touch with all new
                                developments of which he might learn.</p>

                            <p>18. Your June 9, 6 p.m. I have seen the Ambassador of Ecuador this
                                morning and have expressed to him the earnest hope of this
                                Government that at this moment, as there would appear to be good
                                reasons to believe that a more favorable atmosphere was developing
                                for the successful continuation of the boundary negotiations in
                                Washington, no sudden step might be taken which would terminate the
                                negotiations or would give rise to a situation which might lead to a
                                more acute form of controversy.</p>
                            <p>I have explained fully that the President is familiar with every
                                phase of the negotiations and has consistently felt that the way in
                                which he could be most helpful to Ecuador and to Peru as contingent
                                arbitrator was for him to maintain an attitude of the most friendly
                                but scrupulous impartiality as between the two Governments and not
                                attempt to bring moral pressure to bear upon one or the other since
                                this might well give rise to unfounded conjecture.</p>
                            <p>I have reminded the Ambassador of the solemn agreement of all of the
                                American republics at Buenos Aires to solve all disputes which might
                                arise between them only by pacific methods, and I have urged caution
                                and moderation as being in the best interests of the two Governments
                                involved in the dispute.</p>
                            <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0063"/>
                            <p>The considerations which have been advanced to the Ambassador of
                                Ecuador will be reported by him directly to President Páez, and it
                                is not desired that you personally make any further representations
                                either to the President or the Minister of Foreign Affairs. A copy
                                of a memorandum of my conversation with the Ambassador will be sent
                                to you by air mail for your confidential information.</p>

                            <p>33. President Benavides summoned me to the Palace at noon and
                                informed me that he was taking a step in Washington today to relieve
                                the impasse which has existed between the thesis supported by the
                                Peruvian and Ecuadoran boundary delegations now in Washington. He
                                stated that his purpose in calling me was that he wished to have
                                conveyed to President Roosevelt the message that his proposal to
                                submit the preliminary question (<hi rend="italic">asunto
                                    previo</hi>) to the Hague Tribunal was being made merely to help
                                along the negotiations. He wished me to stress the point that the
                                step should not be considered in the least as possible lack of
                                confidence in our President but on the contrary it was his idea that
                                through this procedure the President would be left quite unhampered
                                    (<hi rend="italic">incolume</hi>) to make the final decision in
                                accordance with the protocol of 1924.</p>

                                hastening the termination of the pending boundary question will be

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                                Department’s telegram No. 21 of July 6th, 1 p.m., conveying a
                                message from President Roosevelt to President Benavides with
                                reference to the latter’s message to President Roosevelt concerning
                                the Peruvian-Ecuadoran boundary negotiations.</p>
                            <p>President Benavides received me in audience at noon on July 9th. In
                                compliance with the Department’s instructions, I informed him that
                                President Roosevelt had deeply appreciated his cordial message; that
                                the President’s sole interest in the boundary negotiations is that
                                Peru and Ecuador may find it possible in the near future to reach an
                                amicable settlement of this long-standing question in order that
                                friendly relations between all the American Republics may develop to
                                the fullest degree and that the American Government will view with
                                most sincere gratification any plan which may be satisfactory both
                                to Peru and Ecuador for hastening the termination of the pending
                                boundary question. After he had heard the message, President
                                Benavides said that he was gratified to learn that President
                                Roosevelt had understood the intent of his proposal which had been
                                made in the hope that it would relieve the existing deadlock between
                                the delegates by submitting the previous questions for decision to
                                the highly respected Tribunal of The Hague, and that there was not
                                the least intention on his part to get away from the provisions of
                                the Protocol of 1924, which leaves the final decision in this matter
                                to President Roosevelt.</p>
                            <p>President Benavides stated that the reply to his proposal had not yet
                                been received from the Ecuadoran Government.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the
                                Department that in a conversation on August 25th with the Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs he brought up the subject of the negotiations in
                                Washington for the settlement of the Ecuadorean-Peruvian boundary
                                dispute. He stated that he had authorized his Delegation in
                                Washington, in response to the Peruvian proposal to submit the
                                juridical question to The Hague, to propose <pb n="55"
                                    xml:id="pg_55" facs="0065"/>the submission of the whole
                                controversy to arbitration by the President of the United States. He
                                said quite frankly that his purpose is to prevent the removal of the
                                negotiations from Washington, and his faith in President Roosevelt
                                to hand down an equitable award.</p>
                            <p>He added that he had further authorized the Ecuadorean Delegation to
                                propose that, if Peru refused arbitration by President Roosevelt, an
                                agreement be made on the line of the Garcia-Herrera Treaty,
                                submitting to the arbitration of President Roosevelt the zone
                                comprised between the Pastaza and Morona Rivers. He explained that
                                this line had been agreed to by the Ecuadorean Delegate Herrera and
                                the Peruvian Delegate García. Furthermore, the Ecuadorean Congress
                                had ratified that line, and the Peruvian Congress had also ratified
                                it with the exception of the zone between the two rivers mentioned.
                                The Minister expressed the belief that this is the most reasonable
                                offer that can possibly be made by his Government. He added,
                                parenthetically, that he would probably be stoned by his own people
                                for such a maximum concession.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister then expressed the pessimism he feels that Peru
                                will not agree to either proposal. At that moment he became
                                especially agitated and remarked “it would seem that war is our only
                                recourse”.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that in the
                                course of a talk yesterday with Dr. Carlos Concha, the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs, he requested me to convey the following message to
                                Mr. Welles:</p>
                            <p>He said that in connection with the Ecuadoran boundary dispute, he
                                had instructed Dr. Francisco Tudela y Varela, before his recent
                                departure for Washington, to seek to terminate the discussions along
                                the lines of general principles and legal doctrine, and to commence
                                discussing a practical solution. He said he thought the discussion
                                of general principles had continued long enough and that the time
                                had come for the respective emissaries to consider and endeavor to
                                find a practical solution. He added that as he hoped the
                                negotiations would now enter the final stage, he had instructed Dr.
                                Tudela to keep in the closest possible touch with Mr. Welles and to
                                consult him frequently and without reservation, as he was certain
                                the Under Secretary could and would be glad to be of great
                                assistance to both parties during the final stages of the
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0066"/>
                            <p>Dr. Concha concluded by observing that he was about to make a
                                determined effort to reach a final solution and that while the
                                position thus far taken by the Ecuadoran Government made his task
                                particularly difficult, he was not without hope that—with Mr.
                                Welles’ assistance—an agreement satisfactory to both parties could
                                be arrived at.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p>27. The Minister for Foreign Affairs called at the Legation this
                                morning to request the possible extension of the good offices of the
                                Government of the United States in a matter which has arisen
                                concerning the boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras.</p>
                            <p>On August 4 letters arrived here from Nicaragua bearing a 10 centavos
                                Nicaraguan air mail stamp on the face of which appears a map of
                                section of Central America with a considerable portion of Honduran
                                territory as shown on most maps marked “territory in
                                litigation.”</p>
                            <p>This area includes the territory of Mosquitia and about half of the
                                Departments of Colon and Olancho.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Honduras had considered
                                the boundary question closed since the arbitration award of the King

                                time the United States had offered their services which were
                                accepted by Honduras but not by Nicaragua, but that the matter had
                                been dropped and had remained dormant since then.</p>
                            <p>He showed me the note to be sent to the Nicaraguan Government today
                                which stated: that the Honduran Government regarded this stamp issue
                                as an unfriendly act; that it was an infringement of its national
                                sovereignty; that although it realized the danger of arousing
                                hostile feeling among peoples of neighboring nations it must request
                                the immediate withdrawal of the stamp from circulation; and that it
                                was sure the Nicaraguan Government in the interest of maintaining
                                friendly relations would order such a withdrawal.</p>
                            <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0067"/>
                            <p>In addition to this vigorous protest the Minister told me that all
                                mail received bearing the stamp would be returned to Nicaragua
                                undelivered but that the Honduran Government would be satisfied with
                                the immediate withdrawal of the stamp and that he hoped for an
                                amicable settlement.</p>
                            <p>I will keep Department informed of developments.</p>

                            <p>30. My telegram of August 6, 5 p.m. In a note dated August 26 to the
                                Nicaraguan Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honduran Government
                                “energetically protests” against the publication in Managua of a map
                                showing an alteration in the frontier from that established by the
                                award of 1906. The note ends stating that the Honduran Government
                                “once and for all takes the firm stand that the demarcation of the
                                boundary between Honduras and Nicaragua was fixed by the arbitral
                                decision of the King of Spain.”</p>
                            <p>Feeling against Nicaragua is running high here and the Nicaraguan
                                Minister told me yesterday he feared that the situation might get
                                out of hand and that the Honduran Government might bring about a
                                crisis “by its provocative attitude.”</p>

                            <p>86. On August 26th I airmailed my despatch No. 593 dated August
                                    26th<note n="17" xml:id="d44fn17">Not printed.</note> which
                                should arrive in Washington Monday [<hi rend="italic">Tuesday?</hi>]
                                or so, the despatch describing the present state between Nicaragua
                                and Honduras, to be briefly summarized as follows:</p>
                            <p>In 1935 Honduras issued an airmail postage stamp with a map of that
                                country which depicted the territory in dispute between Honduras <pb
                                    n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0068"/>and Nicaragua as definitely
                                within Honduran boundaries, even including, according to President
                                Somoza, territory which has been and is controlled by Nicaraguan
                                authorities. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that at the
                                time when the Honduran stamp was issued Nicaragua did not consider
                                the matter worthy of protest.</p>
                            <p>On August 10th of this year a Nicaraguan airmail stamp with a map of
                                Nicaragua was put into circulation which segregated the area in
                                question and labelled it “territory in dispute.”</p>
                            <p>Honduras presented a note of protest, requesting that the stamp be
                                withdrawn from circulation.</p>
                            <p>The Honduran position is reported to me to be based on the arbitral
                                award of the King of Spain, which assigned the territory to
                                Honduras, an award which Nicaragua—for factual and juridical reasons
                                adduced—did not accept. It will be recalled that the good offices of
                                the United States, with a view to obtaining a settlement, were
                                offered in 1918, and that in 1921<note n="18" xml:id="d44fn18">See

                                arbitration before the Chief Justice of the United States, a
                                suggestion which Nicaragua accepted but Honduras declined.</p>
                            <p>The territory is now supervised by Nicaragua and Honduras under a
                                “status quo” arrangement which divides it, for present purposes,
                                into two zones, one under each of the two nations.</p>
                            <p>General Somoza invited me to the Casa Presidencial yesterday evening
                                to complain regarding the matter, stating that he is deeply
                                concerned and wishes the Department of State to have complete
                                information.</p>
                            <p>He informed me that the President of Guatemala has offered his
                                mediation in the stamp incident and also his arbitration to settle
                                the whole question of the territory.</p>
                            <p>To gain time, he explained, President Somoza replied to the
                                Guatemalan proposal that he could not give a decision until after
                                despatching Nicaragua’s reply to the Honduran note of protest. Such
                                reply, he told me, will be despatched Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>He informed me that the Nicaraguan note will be drawn with moderation
                                but must convey refusal to withdraw the stamp and a statement of
                                Nicaragua’s position as regards the territory in question.</p>
                            <p>Thursday, he said, he explained his position to the Honduran Minister
                                and called his attention to the following circumstances: that he
                                (the President) had loyally kept his frontier territory clear of
                                Honduran political <hi rend="italic">émigrés</hi>, by considerable
                                labor and at the expense of political affinities with the <hi
                                    rend="italic">émigrés</hi>, who are Liberals; that he knew that
                                Honduras is strengthening her border forces by gathering local
                                levies, but that he has not increased his men or moved a soldier;
                                that <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0069"/>his policy will be to
                                await aggression if the matter comes to a conflict but that he
                                cannot fail to protect Nicaraguan interests if driven. He stated to
                                me that he asked the Honduran Minister to inform President Carias of
                                the above facts and that, through the Minister, he requested Carias
                                to stop troop movements in the interest of preventing friction or
                                incidents which can drive the two countries into a war that would
                                ruin them both.</p>
                            <p>Further, he specifically asked that I convey to the Department (1)
                                that he will accept the mediation of the President of Guatemala to
                                put an end to the present friction between the two countries but (2)
                                as regards the offer of arbitration of territorial rights he would
                                prefer to have the American Government (that is, the Department of
                                State or its nominee) as arbitrator, and in case this is not
                                possible, “to have the Department’s advice as to the arbitration
                                proposed by President Ubico”.<note n="19" xml:id="d44fn19">Jorge
                                    Ubico, President of Guatemala.</note></p>
                            <p>The situation here is quiet, and while the newspapers have given
                                ample attention to the affair of the stamps, they have handled it
                                with moderation and an expressed desire for concord.</p>
                            <p>The President, however, regards conditions as serious.</p>

                                despatches being airmailed tomorrow<note n="20" xml:id="d46fn20">Not
                                    printed.</note> is as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Nicaraguan Minister told me in substance data in the Legation’s
                                telegram from Managua but denied knowledge of his Government’s <pb
                                    n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0070"/>policy in the matter at
                                issue. He added that he was considerably worried that the situation
                                was getting out of hand here.</p>
                            <p>The following day the Honduran Government sent a second vigorous note
                                of protest to Managua as summarized in my telegram No. 30, August
                                27, 8 p.m.</p>
                            <p>For the past 2 weeks the local press has been entirely silent on the
                                matter, but 2 days ago the semi-official newspaper published the
                                text of the award of 1906 and last night a bitter editorial was
                                released, denouncing countries which broke their word and did not
                                line up to treaty obligations.</p>
                            <p>In this capital feeling against Nicaragua is strong. While public
                                demonstrations have been prohibited by the President there is
                                considerable talk of war and the temper of the people is becoming
                                increasingly antagonistic.</p>
                            <p>Last night José María Albir a Nicaraguan and private secretary to the
                                President who has been his most able and conservative adviser and
                                the “brake” on government policy was dismissed which will probably
                                be taken in Managua as further evidence of hostile feeling.</p>
                            <p>The Honduran Government claims that the King of Spain’s award is
                                definitive and that it will not open the boundary question again to
                                arbitration. However, I believe they might accept the good offices
                                of the United States merely from their view point to establish the
                                legality of the arbitration decision of 1906.</p>

                            <p>50. Your 86, August 28, 7 a.m. Please arrange through the Minister of
                                Foreign Affairs for an immediate interview with President
                                Somoza.</p>
                            <p>Please say to President Somoza that this Government greatly
                                appreciates his action in informing it of the present friction
                                between Nicaragua and Honduras and his interest in having the
                                American Government act as arbitrator or offer its advice as to the
                                arbitration of the boundary difficulty. The Government is gratified
                                to learn of the evident statesmanlike determination of President
                                Somoza not to allow the present friction to develop into a war
                                which, as he states, would be ruinous to both countries. You may
                                express the confidence of this <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0071"
                                />Government that the Nicaraguan reply to the Honduran note will be
                                conciliatory in tone and offer a basis for peaceful resolution of
                                the present friction. A pacific resolution of the difficulty would
                                redound to the international renown for statesmanship of President
                                Somoza and his Government.</p>
                            <p>If the President inquires, you may inform him that consideration is
                                being given to his suggestion that this Government might arbitrate
                                the question of territorial rights.</p>
                            <p>In discussing the matter with the Minister of Foreign Affairs you
                                might inform him of the recent statement of Dr. Luis Manuel Debayle
                                to the Chief of the Division of the American Republics that upon his
                                return to Nicaragua he would do everything possible to bring about a
                                speedy termination of the controversy.</p>

                            <p>89. Last night I communicated to the Minister of Foreign Affairs the
                                contents of the Department’s telegram No. 50, including the
                                penultimate paragraph.</p>
                            <p>He dictated to me in English: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“President Somoza is very pleased with the appreciation [<hi
                                            rend="italic">evaluation</hi>] of his attitude and
                                        wishes to let you know that he has not done more than
                                        fulfill his duty as President of Nicaragua and a loyal
                                        friend of the United States, in whose hands he wishes to put
                                        the arbitration of the whole question.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>He stated that the Honduran note is so strong and categorical that
                                reply to it forces upon his Government a firm statement of the
                                Nicaraguan position, but that certainly Nicaragua’s note will leave
                                the door open to conciliation. I am to receive copies of the
                                exchange of notes and will forward them. He stated that in view of
                                Honduran preparations his responsibility is such that he must now
                                look to defence of the Nueva Segovia frontier and he plans day after
                                tomorrow to reinforce his weak forces with 30 men led by Atocotal
                                and Somoto. This will be the first Nicaraguan military move. In my
                                opinion fear of political consequences, if war comes and he is
                                caught unprepared, makes him take the step. He is definitely for
                                peace.</p>
                            <p>Doctor Debayle actively engaged in matter and is a considerable
                                influence on peaceful side.</p>

                            <p>17. On August 28 President Somoza informed our Legation at Managua of
                                his concern regarding the present friction between Nicaragua and
                                Honduras and stated his interest in having the United States
                                Government act as arbitrator or offer its advice as to the
                                arbitration of the boundary difficulty, particularly with respect to
                                the offer of the President of Guatemala to act as mediator or
                                arbitrator. On August 30 the Legation was instructed to seek an
                                interview with President Somoza and to express to him the confidence
                                of this Government that the Nicaraguan reply to the first Honduran
                                note would be conciliatory in tone and offer a basis for peaceful
                                resolution of the present friction. The Legation was instructed to
                                inform the President, if he made further inquiry, that consideration
                                was being given to his suggestion that this Government might
                                arbitrate the question of territorial rights.</p>
                            <p>Please endeavor to arrange through the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                                for an immediate interview with President Carias in which you should
                                inform him that this Government has viewed with increasing concern
                                the controversy between Nicaragua and Honduras. You should express
                                to him the confidence of this Government that the Honduran
                                Government will do all in its power not to permit the present
                                friction to develop into a more serious controversy which would
                                endanger the friendly relations between the two countries. You
                                should remind him that the recent conference at Buenos Aires<note

                                peace on this hemisphere, and that it would now be a misfortune that
                                so shortly after that conference two friendly nations could not get
                                together and compose their difficulties on a high plane of
                                statesmanship. A peaceful solution of the present friction would add
                                to the international renown for statesmanship of President Carias
                                and his Government. You may state that the Government of the United
                                States is disposed to do whatever it can to be of assistance.</p>
                            <p>The Department has noted with interest your own belief that the
                                Honduran Government might accept the good offices of the United
                                States, merely however, from the point of view as to whether or not
                                the arbitral decision of the King of Spain of 1906 is legal. If the
                                President makes any suggestion that the United States use its good
                                offices you are instructed to inform him that you feel confident
                                that your Government will give any suggestion that he cares to make
                                the most serious consideration.</p>
                            <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0073"/>
                            <p>In this connection please endeavor discreetly to ascertain whether
                                the President of Guatemala has also offered his services as mediator
                                or arbitrator to Honduras and if so the reaction or reply of the
                                Honduran Government to this offer.</p>
                            <p>Please repeat to the Legation at Managua all telegrams to the
                                Department.</p>

                                points brought out were: <list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>That Honduras would not permit the question to be reopened
                                        to arbitration.</item>
                                    <label>(2)</label>
                                    <item>That Ubico had offered good offices but Honduras had
                                        merely acknowledged receipt and taken no further
                                        action.</item>
                                    <label>(3)</label>
                                    <item>That a possible acceptable solution might be continuation
                                        of mediation of 1921 but that more time was needed to study
                                        this possibility.</item>
                                    <label>(4)</label>
                                    <item>That Honduras would not take aggressive steps.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>I believe the President to be sincere in the hope of a peaceful
                                solution but the temper of the people is becoming increasingly
                                difficult to control.</p>

                            <p>19. The Department has been informed that the Minister of War has
                                informed Mr. Turnbull of the United Fruit Company that Honduras has
                                not sent as yet a single man into the disputed territory or added to
                                its forces along the already agreed upon border and is disposed to
                                withhold moving any troops provided that the Nicaraguan Government
                                agrees to do likewise.</p>
                            <p>For your information only, the Department was informed this morning
                                by telephone by Dr. Luis Manuel Debayle in Nicaragua that Nicaragua
                                is contemplating sending troops to protect border towns but only
                                because Honduras has already dispatched troops into the <pb n="64"
                                    xml:id="pg_64" facs="0074"/>disputed territory. The Department
                                has reason to believe that if the Honduran Government will agree to
                                maintain the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> with respect to
                                troops both in the disputed territory and along the already agreed
                                upon border the Nicaraguan Government will agree to do likewise.</p>
                            <p>You are requested therefore to endeavor to secure a confirmation of
                                the statement which the Minister of War is said to have made to
                                Turn-bull as quickly as possible.</p>

                                appropriate and advisable, and state that the Honduran Government
                                has assured the Department that no Honduran troops have been
                                dispatched to the border and that the Honduran Government will agree
                                not to move any troops if Nicaragua agrees likewise. You will please
                                express the earnest hope of this Government that the Government of
                                Nicaragua, in order to minimize the possibility of an armed clash,
                                will find it possible to agree with the Honduran Government not to
                                dispatch troops either to the section of the border already agreed
                                upon or into the disputed territory.</p>
                            <p>If the Government of Nicaragua agrees to this proposition you will
                                then suggest that it would seem desirable for the two Governments to
                                confirm the arrangement directly, one to another, through their
                                accredited diplomatic representatives. In this case advise the
                                Legation at Tegucigalpa directly so that it may make a similar
                                suggestion to the Honduran Government. Repeat to the Department your
                                telegram to the Legation at Tegucigalpa.</p>

                            <p>95. Yesterday a decree was issued here prohibiting circulation of the
                                Honduran map stamp in Nicaragua.</p>
                            <p>Somoza would heartily welcome a chance for a common withdrawal of the
                                map stamps and thinks it had best be done by a quiet agreement
                                between the two Governments, possibly little by little, and without
                                publicity.</p>
                            <p>He says that Nicaraguan Foreign Office mail to the Nicaraguan
                                Legation at Tegucigalpa is delivered there with the Honduran map
                                stamp on it. He considers this probably the work of a subordinate,
                                but not helpful.</p>
                            <p>The sticker was on all letters in today’s air mail from Honduras,
                                which were sent back in accordance with decree mentioned above.</p>
                            <p>Repeated to Tegucigalpa.</p>

                                present dispute over the radio here and that he discover whether the
                                Nicaraguan Government would do likewise.</p>
                            <p>Following the agreement not to move troops, the Foreign Minister
                                agreed to prohibit all radio broadcast concerning the question and

                            <p>97. To Mr. Duggan. In pursuance of instructions telephoned by Mr.
                                Duggan to telegraph covering the period subsequent to our telephone
                                conversation of Saturday 3 p.m., I report as follows: Saturday night
                                at 9 o’clock Dr. Debayle, the President’s intimate counselor,
                                returned from the country. I then discussed with him the proposition
                                of the exchange of Honduran-Nicaraguan assurances against the
                                movement of troops to the frontier and arranged to see the President
                                next morning.</p>
                            <p>Sunday morning the President received me at 11 o’clock and we talked
                                until 12, when he left town. The only arrangement which we could
                                conceive, in view of his insistence upon American assistance in
                                arranging things, as he now deeply distrusts the Hondurans, was to
                                have the American Legations in Managua and Tegucigalpa arrange
                                synchronization of the presentation of assurances at the two
                                capitals.</p>
                            <p>It was emphasized as clearly understood that any action which must be
                                taken by his [<hi rend="italic">this?</hi>] office would be merely
                                to help the two Governments get together, and nothing more, without
                                any guarantee of engagements which the two countries might enter
                                into.</p>
                            <p>Telegraph offices being closed most of Sunday, I could not
                                communicate until after 5 p.m. and by that time a more desirable
                                plan suggested itself, which I could communicate to our Chargé in
                                Tegucigalpa, and get his reply and comments, more expeditely by
                                telephoning next morning.</p>
                            <p>I saw Dr. Debayle next morning at 10. I suggested to him the
                                proposition of having the heads of the Nicaraguan and Honduran
                                Foreign Offices talk by telephone and arrange matters between them
                                and, in our conversation, led him to consider that the points to be
                                covered might well be (1) the hour for the presentation of
                                assurances by the diplomatic representatives accredited in the two
                                countries, (2) the form and extent of the assurances, and (3) the
                                handling of publicity. Debayle telephoned to the President and
                                obtained his approval. The telephone conversation between the two
                                Ministers was tentatively set at 4 p.m. and the presentation of the
                                assurances by the diplomats at 11 tomorrow morning (Tuesday).</p>
                            <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0078"/>
                            <p>At 12 I talked by telephone with Cramp at Tegucigalpa, conveying
                                these propositions for the consideration of the Government of
                                Honduras. He telephoned me at 1:30 that President Carias was
                                “enthusiastic and delighted”. At 4 Cramp and I introduced the two
                                Ministers for Foreign Relations over the telephone and both
                                definitely retired, leaving them to discuss matters and make their
                                arrangements.</p>
                            <p>After the telephone conversation the Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs told me that it had been agreed that the two accredited
                                diplomats are to present the assurances to the two Presidents at 11
                                o’clock Tuesday morning.</p>
                            <p>The assurances are to be worded essentially as follows (from the
                                telegram of instructions sent by the Foreign Office to the
                                Nicaraguan Minister at Tegucigalpa): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Government of Nicaragua, desirous of facilitating a
                                        pacific settlement of the present friction, has authorized
                                        me to inform Your Excellency that, on a basis of strict
                                        reciprocity it engages itself not to send troops to the
                                        frontier region between the two countries. It is with the
                                        greatest satisfaction that the Government of Nicaragua
                                        avails itself of this opportunity to reiterate to the
                                        Government over which Your Excellency so worthily presides
                                        its good wishes and respectful consideration.”</p>

                            <p>President Somoza appears anxious to end the friction if he can do so
                                with decorum according to the criteria of the country. The public
                                aspect here is calm, now that radio blackguarding has ceased. Still,
                                the spontaneity and enthusiasm of demonstrations in the provincial
                                cities at the time of the radio war, the growing sentiment in
                                Managua at that time, the more recent mass offers of services
                                received by Somoza from chauffeurs, railroad men and similar, as

                            <p>52. The joint assurances of the Nicaraguan and Honduran Governments,
                                together with their covering letters, were prominently published
                                this afternoon in the press without comment.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office desired to mention that this had been done through
                                the good offices of the Legations, but I insisted no mention be made
                                of our part therein and the press makes no reference thereto.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister informed me this morning that he thought the
                                reaction throughout the country would be favorable and that he was
                                more than pleased with this first step toward the reestablishment of
                                good relations with Nicaragua.</p>
                            <p>I expect to have this Government’s comments on the proposal of mutual
                                withdrawal of the map stamps tomorrow.</p>

                                that a friendly solution of such questions as remain may be happily

                            <p>102. General Somoza would be glad to have a neutral zone on the
                                frontier, but his practical concept of such a zone, while reasonable
                                from a Nicaraguan viewpoint, would involve withdrawals by Honduras
                                to which I firmly believe she would not consent, and the
                                communication of which might even possibly arouse Honduran
                                indignation.</p>
                            <p>Cramp and I have discussed the matter by telephone. He did not
                                receive a favorable reaction to his very guarded inquiry at
                                Tegucigalpa, and he and I venture to believe that this is not the
                                moment for the idea but that it had better be left dormant.</p>

                            <p>54. I was told this evening by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that
                                Honduras will not reopen the frontier limitation question to
                                arbitration. I gathered in my conversation with him that the basis
                                for mediation which the Government will consider is for the
                                definition of the obscure points mentioned in the alleged Nicaraguan
                                acceptance of 1906, which mostly concern the area around
                                Teotecacinte.</p>
                            <p>He told me personally and in strictest confidence that the Government
                                was not entirely adverse to the offer of President Ubico, but that
                                it would prefer, if possible, to find some other means of solving
                                the question.</p>

                            <p>57. For Duggan. Referring to our conversation this morning, I have
                                suggested to Castleman that he obtain some statement from President
                                Somoza with reference to his desire for reciprocal withdrawal of the
                                stamps, which could be quoted direct to the President of Honduras
                                tomorrow.</p>

                            <p>58. I have just learned that the Director of Posts here has agreed
                                not to place the blue sticker on mail for Nicaragua, reciprocating
                                the agreement of the Director of Posts in Nicaragua not to put the
                                Nicaraguan stamp on mail destined here. This was arranged through
                                the good offices of Pan American Airways in both capitals.</p>

                            <p>60. For Duggan. It is now believed that, should the Department
                                approve of again presenting the matter of withdrawal of stamp in
                                accordance with this morning’s conversation and the Legation’s
                                telegram No. 57, September 8, noon, it could be handled more
                                effectively through the Foreign Minister rather than direct with the

                            <p>26. On the occasion of your visit tomorrow to the Foreign Minister
                                the Department desires you to repeat its gratification of the action
                                taken by him to prevent an increase in the tension existing between
                                Honduras and Nicaragua. The Minister’s highly statesmanlike attitude
                                and action augur well for a solution of the present controversy.</p>
                            <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0082"/>
                            <p>You may then state the hope of this Government to Dr. Lozano that now
                                that mutually satisfactory steps have been taken with regard to
                                troop movements to the frontier, both Governments will endeavor to
                                find some means of settling in an equally satisfactory manner the
                                immediate cause for the recent flaring up of the long-standing
                                boundary dispute. You may say that your Government has been
                                confidentially informed that the Government of Nicaragua would
                                welcome an opportunity for a mutual withdrawal of the map stamps and
                                other official printed insignia and considers that this might best
                                be accomplished by an agreement arrived at between the two
                                Governments and without publicity. The desirability of withdrawing
                                the stamps gradually has been emphasized. You may inform the
                                Minister that it would certainly redound to the reputation which his
                                country has for peace if some such arrangement as that indicated or
                                any other arrangement that is equally agreeable to the two
                                Governments could be arrived at.</p>
                            <p>In concluding you may inform the Minister of the Department’s belief
                                that some such action as above indicated would be highly beneficial
                                and would in no wise prejudice the position of Honduras with respect
                                to the existing controversy but on the contrary would give a new
                                indication to the Western Hemisphere of Honduras’ intention to
                                adhere to peaceful means in the settlement of international
                                disputes. You should, of course, inform the Minister that these
                                views of your Government are merely presented for his consideration
                                and because of the lasting friendship of the United States for his
                                country.</p>
                            <p>You may permit the Minister to read but not to retain a paraphrase of
                                the present telegram which is being repeated to Managua.<note n="28"

                                the Honduran Government states that it cannot withdraw the 1935
                                stamp. However, as a friendly gesture it will immediately suppress
                                the blue sticker.</p>

                            <p>108. A morning paper prints the text of the exchange of notes between
                                Costa Rica and Nicaragua relative to the Costa Rican offer of
                                mediation, also the Honduran reply to the Costa Rican offer, a
                                Guatemalan communication to Costa Rica relative to Nicaragua’s reply
                                to its offer of mediation, and a Salvadoran note of the Government
                                of Costa Rica.</p>
                            <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs states that this material was given out
                                in Costa Rica, to his annoyance.</p>
                            <p>The Nicaraguan reply to Costa Rica, as principle, courteously
                                declines the Costa Rican offer, saying “(my Government) is in the
                                case of informing (you) that, as it considers the mediation
                                initiated from the year 1918 by the Government of the United States
                                of America (to be still) pending, it has already informed that
                                Government, with motive of the new difficulty which has arisen in
                                relation to the old <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0084"/>question
                                of the frontier between Honduras and Nicaragua, of the satisfaction
                                with which it would see the continuance of its good offices. The
                                Department of State has advised that it is giving the matter its
                                most attentive consideration.” The note further states Nicaragua
                                gave the same reply to Guatemala’s offer, and adds, “in any case, if
                                my Government should remain free from the engagements mentioned
                                nothing would be more welcome to it than” to confide the obtention
                                of a solution to the President of Costa Rica.</p>
                            <p>The Honduran note states in declining the Costa Rican offer, that
                                “due to the measures of friendly Governments an understanding has
                                been reached between the Foreign Offices of the two nations prepared
                                against the mobilization of troops which could be brought about by
                                the recent friction.”</p>
                            <p>Guatemala told Costa Rica that the Guatemalan offer had been declined
                                because it had official notice that the good offices of the United
                                States, accepted in 1918, were still pending.</p>
                            <p>Salvadoran note uninteresting.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is vexed at Costa Rica’s divulging
                                these essentially confidential documents and tells me that as the
                                proposition of American mediation was never taken up formally with
                                the Department, the Nicaraguan Minister in Washington will be
                                instructed to consult with the Department relative to the
                                “conveniencia” of manifesting formally the satisfaction with which
                                Nicaragua would see a continuance of the good offices of the United
                                States, and then, if there is no objection, formally to express this
                                principle. The Minister for Foreign Affairs takes this course
                                consequent upon the President’s desire for American mediation
                                expressed to me (really meant our intervening in general; see my

                                and in view of the Department’s helpfulness in the case, hoping that
                                it may be considered a continuance of the action of 1918. The
                                President is particularly desirous to avoid acceptance of any
                                mediation except that of the United States and does not want to be
                                obliged to pay further attention to Ubico’s offer, which he feels
                                chary about.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                                Legation’s telegram No. 67, September 19, 8 p.m., 1937, and to the
                                Department’s telegram No. 29, September 22, 6 p.m., 1937, relative
                                to the possible employment of American pilots by the Honduran
                                Government to fly its planes, and to report that I was today
                                informed by “Colonel” Brooks that to date he had not taken any steps
                                towards obtaining these new men.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the same question, the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                told me that he knew nothing whatsoever concerning the matter, such
                                things being handled directly by the President. In accordance with
                                the Department’s instructions, it was pointed out to him that the
                                Legation could not but look with grave concern upon American pilots
                                being used in the event of hostilities. The Foreign Minister then
                                said that he did not know what instructions the President had given
                                his son, Mr. Gonzalo Carías C, who has returned to New York City as
                                Honduran Consul General and who may possibly be endeavoring to
                                employ Americans. In this connection, when Mr. Carías returned to
                                this country some weeks ago he brought with him one American
                                mechanic, but no pilots.</p>

                            <p>30. Yesterday the boundary dispute was discussed separately with the
                                Honduran Chargé and the Nicaraguan Minister at some length along the
                                following lines:</p>
                            <p>That the United States, while it is not extending its good offices at
                                this moment, nevertheless, as a friend of Honduras, is desirous of
                                assisting in every way agreeable to the two Republics to bring about
                                a satisfactory termination of this long standing controversy which
                                has given rise in the past to bitterness, recriminations and even
                                military preparations on the part of both countries;</p>
                            <p>That in view of the solemn pledges for the maintenance of peace,
                                entered into at the recent conference at Buenos Aires, it would be
                                highly unfortunate if the dispute could not be amicably settled;</p>
                            <p>That this Government firmly believes that both Honduras and Nicaragua
                                are desirous of arriving at a mutually satisfactory understanding
                                that would remove forever the source of irritation;</p>
                            <p>That if the two countries can sit down at a common council table and
                                settle their differences between themselves, they will have given an
                                example to the world of statesmanship and of the ability of
                                countries to settle their differences peacefully;</p>
                            <p>That it is hoped, therefore, that the two countries will take an
                                early opportunity to confer with one another in an endeavor to find,
                                first of all, a mutually agreeable basis for procedure and,
                                secondly, by following that procedure, a final settlement of the
                                dispute; and</p>
                            <p>That this Government, and it is presumed other American governments,
                                would of course wish to consider earnestly any joint request for
                                their friendly good offices that the Governments of Nicaragua and
                                Honduras might wish to make as a result of their consultation with
                                one another.</p>
                            <p>Finally the opportunity was taken to point out to the Minister that
                                should this dispute become more acute, and no pacific solution
                                appear to be envisaged, it would then seem fitting and in accordance
                                with the spirit of the pledges entered into at Buenos Aires that the
                                countries of this hemisphere consult with one another in order to
                                determine what proposals for peaceful settlement they might care to
                                offer.</p>

                            <p>The Honduran Chargé brought out the point that Honduras had accepted

                                Nicaraguan Congress. In the ensuing discussion it was intimated that
                                possibly this protocol could serve as one of the bases for the
                                discussions between the two governments, an effort being made to
                                find some common meeting ground on those aspects of the protocol
                                which were found unsatisfactory by the Nicaraguan Congress.</p>

                                discussion provides a suitable opening you may mention that the
                                protocol of 1930 might be one of the starting points for the direct
                                discussions between the two countries.</p>

                            <p>70. Department’s telegram No. 30, October 1, 7 p.m. The Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs informed me this morning that the Honduran
                                Government would gladly agree to reopening the question of the
                                protocol of 1931. He added that such a reopening could only be
                                considered with regard to the demarcation of the boundary, pointing
                                out that article 1 of the protocol dealt with the award of 1900 [<hi
                                    rend="italic">1906</hi>] and that the Honduran Government would
                                not discuss this question, as it considered the award definitive and
                                the question closed.</p>
                            <p>It was gathered that there was little possibility of the two
                                Governments getting together without the good offices of some other
                                country. The feeling seemed to be that Nicaragua originated the
                                dispute and the first conciliative move should come from there.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister said that the Honduran Government would prefer
                                to have the United States as sole mediator, but added that if <pb
                                    n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0088"/>one or two American Republics
                                should offer to mediate, [a?] Central American country would be

                                Foreign Minister states Nicaragua appreciates communication and
                                continues in the same good will toward seeking a peaceful solution,
                                but unfortunately the conduct of the Honduran Government toward
                                certain Nicaraguan Consuls and toward the persons and goods of
                                Nicaraguans resident in Honduras renders impossible any direct
                                conference between the two countries either by themselves to seek
                                out peaceful solutions or jointly to solicit the good offices of
                                other countries, and, for this reason, Nicaragua considers herself
                                the desirability of expressing by herself the satisfaction with
                                which she would see the United States, alone or associated with
                                other countries, extend her good offices for the solution of the
                                case.</p>
                            <p>My comment: The Nicaraguan Government has at last abandoned its
                                former attitude of regarding the case more as a vexation and on
                                account of the continued reports of the persecution of Nicaraguans
                                in Honduras is now genuinely angry. I consider the situation here as
                                now more serious than at any time during the affair.</p>
                            <p>Repeated to Tegucigalpa.</p>

                            <p>31. Department’s No. 30 of October 1, 7 p.m. In reply to the friendly
                                and informal suggestions proffered by this Government, the
                                Government of Honduras has replied that it would be willing to
                                consider reaching an agreement with Nicaragua for the purpose of
                                soliciting the good offices of one or more American states in order
                                to promote a pacific and definitive settlement of the boundary
                                dispute. The Government of Honduras has further indicated that
                                because of the past <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0089"
                                />familiarity of the Government of the United States with this
                                pending boundary controversy, it would prefer that the good offices
                                in question be undertaken by the United States.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Nicaragua has stated in reply to the suggestion
                                proffered by the United States that the recent conduct of the
                                Honduran Government “towards certain Nicaraguan Consuls and towards
                                the persons and goods of Nicaraguans resident in Honduras” would
                                make it impossible for Nicaragua to attempt through direct
                                negotiations with Honduras either to seek peaceful solutions or
                                jointly to solicit the good offices of other countries. Nicaragua is
                                considering the desirability of expressing unilaterally the
                                satisfaction with which she would see the United States, either
                                alone or associated with other powers, extend good offices for the
                                solution of the dispute.</p>
                            <p>In view of the willingness thus expressed by both parties to the
                                controversy to accept the good offices of one or more of the
                                American states to facilitate the pacific solution of the
                                controversy, the Government of the United States suggests for the
                                consideration of the Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua the
                                desirability of accepting the good offices of three American powers,
                                one to be selected by common accord from the republics of South
                                America, one by common accord from the republics of Central America
                                and, should this procedure be acceptable to the two Governments
                                concerned, the Government of the United States will gladly serve as
                                the third of the powers to tender their good offices.</p>
                            <p>You are instructed to communicate orally the foregoing to the
                                Minister of Foreign Affairs at the earliest opportunity and to state
                                that should this suggestion meet with the approval of his
                                Government, this Government would propose as the most expeditious
                                manner of obtaining the friendly services of the three American
                                states above referred to, that the Government of Honduras indicate
                                to the Government of the United States three governments of South
                                America and three governments of Central America whose good offices
                                it would be prepared to accept, indicating the suggestions in the
                                order of preference. Upon receipt of the opinion so expressed by the
                                Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua and should it be possible in
                                the panels submitted to select two Governments acceptable to both
                                parties, the Government of the United States would then gladly
                                inquire of the Government of South America and of the Government of
                                Central America so selected whether they would be disposed to join
                                with the United States in the tender of good offices for the
                                purposes in mind.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion you should make it clear that, while the Government of
                                the United States, because of its interest in the maintenance of <pb
                                    n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0090"/>peace in the world at large
                                and in particular in the Western Hemisphere, would be happy to be of
                                service to the two Governments in suggesting a pacific settlement of
                                the present controversy, it would not care to undertake these
                                friendly services alone. It would prefer to be associated with at
                                least two other American republics in this endeavor. As was made
                                clear by the pacts adopted at the Conference at Buenos Aires, any
                                threat to the maintenance of peace on the American Continent is a
                                matter of concern to all of the American republics, and this
                                Government strongly believes that it would be preferable from the
                                standpoint of inter-American relationships that in the present
                                instance the task of assuring a peaceful and satisfactory settlement
                                of this dispute be entrusted to at least three American republics
                                and not to one alone.</p>
                            <p>Please telegraph the Department as soon as possible of the reply of
                                the Government to which you are accredited.</p>

                            <p>74. In compliance with Department’s telegram No. 31, October 6, 7
                                p.m., plan was presented to the Foreign Minister today. He expressed
                                appreciation for willingness of the United States to continue its
                                attitude of helpfulness and said that he would take the plan up with
                                the President. The Foreign Minister made it clear, and re-emphasized
                                it several times, that under no circumstances would his Government
                                agree to any new plan for settlement which in any event involves the
                                validity of the award of the Mexican Minister to Spain. [<hi

                                October 1, 7 p.m.,<note n="37" xml:id="d83fn37">See footnote 31,
                                        <ref target="#pg_76">p. 76</ref>.</note> I mentioned the
                                protocol of 1931 as a possible point of departure. No conclusion was
                                formulated by the Minister because matters took a different trend.
                                However, his initial opinion was that the protocol in its original
                                form, particularly the substance of the first clause which is
                                insisted upon by the Honduran Minister for Foreign Affairs, is not
                                acceptable to Nicaragua. He seemed to think that the protocol as
                                modified by Congress,<note n="38" xml:id="d83fn38"><ref

                                Foreign Minister for the year 1931, might be acceptable, but the
                                Department will note that this instrument denies the validity of the

                            <p>32. Your 74, October 7, 4 p.m. Please say to the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs that the Honduran position as regards the basis of a
                                definitive settlement of the territorial dispute has been carefully
                                noted. This Government believes, however, that the first and most
                                urgent objective of the suggested utilization of good offices is the
                                proposal of measures which may relieve the present tension in the
                                relations of Nicaragua and Honduras and thereafter the suggestion of
                                bases for a definitive settlement of the fundamental issue. At this
                                second stage it would be appropriate for Honduras to set forth its
                                position as regards the basis of a definitive settlement of the
                                controversy.</p>

                            <p>Because of the lamentable boundary incident that has arisen between
                                this country and Nicaragua, which is of continental interest, I am
                                authorized by the Constitutional President of the Republic to make
                                the following spontaneous declarations in the name of the Government
                                of Honduras. First: Honduras reiterates her conviction that it is
                                the duty of the American nations to preserve peace on the continent.
                                Second: Honduras points with pride to the deep respect that her
                                international obligations are given by her; respect shown by
                                honoring the obligations undertaken in the treaties she has signed.
                                Third: Honduras makes plain her devotion to the civilized method of
                                arbitration for settling controversies between nations. Fourth: as a
                                consequence of her devotion to the institution of arbitration,
                                Honduras declares the sanctity of arbitral decisions. Fifth: <pb
                                    n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0093"/>Honduras will always be
                                disposed to give the best reception to any suggestion that may be
                                made to her for friendly mediation on matters of an international
                                character, provided that respect for and obedience to arbitral
                                awards already made is included in the suggestion. And sixth:
                                Honduras has full confidence that as she has understood how to
                                respect the rights of others her own rights will also be
                                respected.</p>

                                Minister at 2:30 this afternoon to report substance of Department’s
                                instructions. Was unable to make earlier engagement with Foreign
                                Office because of Cabinet meeting this morning. The Foreign
                                Minister, after reiterating Honduras’ position, as stated in my
                                telegram No. 74, October 7, 4 p.m., expressed renewed appreciation

                                Minister said however that his Government does not consider it

                                Nicaragua and Honduras, and thereafter the examination of bases for
                                a permanent settlement of the fundamental issue. At this second
                                stage it would be appropriate for Nicaragua to set forth its
                                position as regards the bases for a definitive settlement of the
                                controversy. In advance of this stage of the discussions the
                                Department cannot take any position with respect to the bases for a
                                solution of the fundamental problem.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing is for your guidance in any conversations you may have
                                with the Nicaraguan Government.</p>

                            <p>33. Your telegram no. 76, October 9, noon. The Department has
                                received the telegram from the Honduran Foreign Minister referred to
                                in your telegram cited above and in reply thereto you are instructed
                                to make the following oral representations to the Minister of
                                Foreign Affairs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Upon instructions of my Government I have the honor to
                                        acknowledge the receipt by the Secretary of State of Your
                                        Excellency’s telegram of October 9 and to state that my
                                        Government has noted with gratification the devotion of the
                                        Honduran Government to the ideals of continental peace and
                                        pacific settlement of controversies between nations. It is
                                        hardly necessary to state that this Government fully shares
                                        Honduras’ views as to the desirability of the pacific
                                        settlement of disputes and the sanctity of arbitral
                                        decisions.</p>
                                    <p>It is noted that Honduras will always be disposed to give the
                                        best reception to any suggestion that may be made to her for
                                        friendly mediation on matters of an international character
                                        provided that respect for and obedience to arbitral awards
                                        already made is included in this suggestion.</p>
                                    <p>In this connection, my Government desires to express the view
                                        that in the friendly preliminary discussions which are
                                        contemplated, the question of the sanctity of arbitral
                                        awards does not arise.</p>
                                    <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0095"/>
                                    <p>As has previously been indicated to Your Excellency, my
                                        Government believes that the immediate and most urgent
                                        objective of the suggested utilization of good offices is
                                        the proposal of measures which may allay the present tension
                                        in the relations of Nicaragua and Honduras, and thereafter
                                        the examination of bases for a permanent settlement of the
                                        fundamental issue.</p>
                                    <p>My Government believes that on consideration the Honduran
                                        Government will agree that, in advance of the preliminary
                                        discussions it would not be desirable for either of the
                                        parties to place any conditions on their acceptance of good
                                        offices nor seek to insist upon prior agreement upon the
                                        bases of settlement of the fundamental issue. The basic
                                        issue cannot be satisfactorily discussed until the present
                                        obstructive tension has been cleared away.</p>
                                    <p>Acceptance of the good offices suggested and entry into the
                                        necessary preliminary discussions designed to remove the
                                        present friction can in no way be construed as impairing the
                                        position or rights of either party in later discussions
                                        directed towards a permanent settlement of the basic
                                        issue.</p>
                                    <p>In view of the foregoing considerations the Government of the
                                        United States hopes that Your Excellency’s Government will
                                        find itself in a position to proceed at an early date to
                                        name the panel of American powers from which two will be
                                        selected to lend their good offices in association with the
                                        Government of the United States.”</p>

                            <p>Referring to the declarations of the Government of Honduras of the
                                9th of this October in connection with the incident that has arisen
                                between Nicaragua and that country as a sequel to the old boundary
                                question, I have been instructed by the President of the Republic to
                                declare the following: First. Nicaragua’s traditional policy has
                                been and is that of the most loyal adherence to peace, as is proved
                                not only by her modest and unconditional support of the elaboration
                                of antiwar law, but, chiefly, by her conduct, during the present
                                friction with Honduras, firmly oriented, even at the cost of great
                                sacrifices, towards the prevention of the outbreak of war between
                                two peoples so closely bound together by their history and the
                                solidarity of a common destiny. Second. Nicaragua’s policy is
                                likewise traditionally respectful of the principle of the sanctity
                                of treaties. Third. Nicaragua considers that the disapproval by her
                                public authorities of the arbitral award by the King of Spain that
                                was handed down on the <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0096"
                                />question of the boundary with Honduras is not incompatible with
                                the preceding declaration as the said award was prepared and
                                delivered in substantial violation of the treaty that defined the
                                obligatory relation between the parties, and it may even be said
                                that the said award is not based on the arbitration agreement, as
                                the life of the latter had already expired. Fourth. Nicaragua has
                                always been disposed to submit her allegations as to the nullity of
                                the award to a new arbitration, whereby she demonstrates her sincere
                                devotion to this civilized means of settlement of disputes. Fifth.
                                Nicaragua likewise has been and is disposed to secure the definitive
                                settlement of the question pending with Honduras by any non-military
                                method, on the basis of mutual concessions. Sixth. In accordance
                                with the foregoing declarations, which she considers sufficiently
                                broad, Nicaragua declares that she would accept with satisfaction
                                the friendly intervention of third governments that might be
                                suggested to her for the purposes of the preceding paragraph.</p>

                            <p>68. The Department has received a telegram dated October 13 from the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to the boundary dispute,
                                the text of which is presumably available to you. In reply thereto
                                you are instructed to make the following oral statement to the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Pursuant to instructions of my Government, I have the honor
                                        to acknowledge the receipt by the Secretary of State of Your
                                        Excellency’s telegram of October 13. My Government is deeply
                                        gratified with Your Excellency’s declaration of Nicaragua’s
                                        policy of adherence to peace and respect for treaties and
                                        your Government’s firm intention to prevent the outbreak of

                                        believes, however, that the question of the validity of the
                                        award does not arise in the contemplated preliminary
                                        discussions which have as their object the proposal of
                                        measures designed to allay the existing tension in the
                                        relations of the two countries, thereafter proceeding to the
                                        examination of the bases of a permanent settlement of the
                                        fundamental issue.</p>

                                    <p>My Government believes that the Nicaraguan Government will
                                        agree that in advance of the preliminary discussions it will
                                        not be desirable for either of the parties to seek to insist
                                        upon consideration of their views as to the bases of a
                                        settlement of the fundamental issue. It would seem that the
                                        basic issue cannot be satisfactorily discussed until the
                                        present obstructive tension has been cleared away. The
                                        suggested procedure can in no way be construed as impairing
                                        the position or rights of either party in later discussions
                                        directed toward a permanent settlement of the basic
                                        issue.”</p>

                            <p>34. I asked the Chargé d’Affaires of Honduras to call this morning
                                and expressed to him the friendly concern with which this Government
                                viewed the delay on the part of the Government of Honduras in
                                suggesting to this Government the names of the other American
                                republics which it would desire to see associated in the tender of
                                good offices as indicated in my earlier message.</p>
                            <p>I asked the Chargé d’Affaires to transmit by cable this expression of
                                concern to his Government and to emphasize the following points:</p>
                            <p>1. That in view of the increasing agitation in both republics and in
                                view of the reports received of alleged military preparations both
                                in Honduras and in Nicaragua, it would seem to be urgently necessary
                                that this tension be relieved and that it would seem that the best
                                way of accomplishing this result was for the two governments to
                                permit other American states in whom they jointly had confidence to
                                extend their good offices for the purpose of seeking to find a
                                possible settlement of these difficulties;</p>
                            <p>2. That when the representatives of the countries extending their
                                good offices met, the Government of Honduras could then with
                                complete liberty of action and with every right make known its
                                position with regard to the arbitral award and indicate its
                                unwillingness to accept any proposed solution other than one based
                                upon the recognition of the validity of the award. It would then
                                devolve upon the nations extending their good offices to try and
                                find the ways and means of devising the basis for a practical and
                                pacific solution acceptable both to Honduras and to Nicaragua.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion I requested the Chargé d’Affaires to inform his
                                Government that the Government of the United States was receiving
                                increasingly serious reports of preparations being made for possible
                                hostilities both in Honduras and Nicaragua; that it hoped that
                                Honduras might, consequently, in the immediate future suggest the
                                names of other American republics to join in the extension of good
                                offices, but that if Honduras, for some reason of which this
                                Government is unaware, refrained from making such suggestions and of
                                thus indicating its willingness to permit of the extension of the
                                good offices <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0098"/>which it has
                                officially stated it was willing to accept, the United States
                                Government, because of the declaration jointly made by every
                                American republic at the Conference at Buenos Aires that a threat to
                                the peace of any republic was a matter of legitimate concern to all
                                of the other American republics, would feel itself compelled,
                                because of its desire to assure the maintenance of peace on the
                                American continent, to suggest to all of the other American
                                republics joint consultation for the purpose of determining what
                                friendly solution might be suggested by all of the republics for the
                                pacific settlement of this controversy.</p>
                            <p>The Chargé d’Affaires assured me that he would cable his Government
                                immediately in the above sense. He expressed his personal regret for
                                the delay in the receipt by this Government of the suggestions
                                requested from the Government of Honduras.</p>
                            <p>The Department desires you to reiterate the points above enumerated
                                to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the first possible
                                opportunity and to keep the Department closely advised by telegram

                                    <p>“First: With the understanding that the immediate and most
                                        urgent objective of the suggestion of utilization of the
                                        good offices of the three American nations is the proposal
                                        of means which might soften the present tension in the
                                        relations between Honduras and Nicaragua and that the basic
                                        matter cannot be discussed satisfactorily until present
                                        obstructive tension has disappeared, my Government accepts
                                        the suggestion of good offices on preliminary discussions to
                                        arrive at proposing such means, and with that idea submits,
                                        on an attached sheet, for the consideration of the American
                                        Government, the panels of the American nations of which two

                                    <p>Second: Upon Honduras’ accepting the suggestion of good

                                        of the American Government that ‘in no way, this acceptance
                                        and that act, should be interpreted as jeopardizing the
                                        position and rights of the parties in the subsequent

                                    <p>“This Government is deeply gratified at the decision of the
                                        Honduran Government to accept the good offices of third

                                        Nicaragua.</p>

                                        governments of South America and three governments of
                                        Central America whose good offices it would be prepared to
                                        accept.</p>
                                    <p>“This Government inquires whether the Government of Costa
                                        Rica would be acceptable to the Government of Honduras as
                                        regards the selection of a Central American government. Upon
                                        confirmation of the acceptability of the good offices of
                                        Costa Rica to both Honduras and Nicaragua, this Government
                                        is prepared promptly to inquire of the Costa Rica Government
                                        whether it is disposed to join in the contemplated
                                        discussions.</p>
                                    <p>“As regards the selection of a South American country no
                                        basis of agreement is found in the panels submitted by the
                                        two governments. Accordingly this Government ventures to
                                        suggest that agreement be given to the selection of
                                        Venezuela, which was named by neither government in the
                                        panels submitted. The same suggestion is being communicated
                                        to the Government of Nicaragua.”</p>

                            <p>91. Referring to Department’s telegram Number 36, October 18, 7 p.m.,
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated this morning that the
                                Honduran Government accepts with the greatest pleasure both Costa
                                Rica and Venezuela.</p>
                            <p>He added that he believed that as soon as the acceptance of both
                                countries, the good offices of the three American Republics could be
                                made public, the present tension would be immediately removed and
                                that he hoped that this publicity could be released as quickly as
                                possible.</p>

                            <p>35. You are requested to obtain at the earliest moment an interview
                                with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and make to him the following
                                oral communication: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>As the Government of Costa Rica is aware, there has existed a
                                        longstanding controversy between the Governments of
                                        Nicaragua and of Honduras as to the location of their common
                                        boundary. An Arbitral award was rendered by the King of
                                        Spain in 1906, but full effect has not been given to it.
                                        Various and unsuccessful efforts have been made to negotiate
                                        a final settlement of the controversy. Recently,
                                        unfortunately, the controversy has become more acute and
                                        various incidents have occurred tending to create tension
                                        between the two countries. The Government of the United
                                        States has regretfully come to the conclusion that the
                                        dispute has now reached such proportions as to involve the
                                        actual danger of possible hostilities.</p>
                                    <p>The Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua<note n="44"
                                            xml:id="d96fn44">The acceptance of Nicaragua was
                                            reported to the Department by the Legation at Managua in

                                        today informed this Government that they would welcome the
                                        tender of good offices jointly on the part of Venezuela,
                                        Costa Rica, and the United States for the purpose, first, of
                                        removing the present tension in the relation of the two
                                        republics and thereafter for the purpose of suggesting the
                                        means which might be adopted by Honduras and Nicaragua
                                        towards arriving at a definitive settlement of the
                                        fundamental territorial question.</p>

                                    <p>The Government of the United States has advised the
                                        Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua that it would be happy
                                        to inform the Governments of Venezuela and of Costa Rica of
                                        this disposition on the part of Honduras and Nicaragua to
                                        welcome the good offices of Venezuela, Costa Rica and the
                                        United States. In view of the spirit of the conventions and
                                        resolutions unanimously adopted by the American republics at
                                        the recent Conference at Buenos Aires for the maintenance of
                                        peace and in view of the unfailing devotion of the
                                        Government of Costa Rica to that high ideal, the Government
                                        of the United States hopes that the Government of Costa Rica
                                        may be willing to take part in this common effort for the
                                        pacific solution of the unfortunate dispute which has arisen
                                        between Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>
                                    <p>Should the Government of Costa Rica feel itself disposed to
                                        proffer its good offices, jointly with the Government of
                                        Venezuela and the United States, it is suggested that the
                                        text of the tender of good offices may be conveniently
                                        agreed upon by the Ministers of Costa Rica and Venezuela and
                                        the Department of State in Washington and that, once such
                                        text is determined upon, the tender of good offices might be
                                        made directly but simultaneously to Honduras and Nicaragua
                                        by the three Governments above mentioned.</p>
                                    <p>The steps to be taken in carrying out in the most efficient
                                        manner possible the tender of good offices may perhaps be
                                        discussed in the same manner. It would seem probable that
                                        representatives of the three Governments tendering their
                                        good offices might well visit the two countries involved in
                                        the controversy in order that they may on the spot suggest
                                        practical means for the alleviation of the existing
                                        situation.</p>
                                    <p>The Government of the United States likewise suggests that
                                        should the Governments of Venezuela and Costa Rica agree
                                        upon the tender of good offices, jointly with the United
                                        States, the three Governments might immediately thereafter
                                        advise all of the other American republics of the assistance
                                        they intend to offer with the hope of facilitating a pacific
                                        solution of the dispute between Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>

                            <p>It has been tentatively agreed that the representatives of the
                                countries tendering good offices will meet with representatives of
                                the Governments of Nicaragua and Honduras in San José, Costa Rica,
                                on about November 1. You will therefore arrange to be in San José on
                                that date or as soon thereafter as possible.</p>
                            <p>While it is obvious that during the conduct of your mission you will
                                have to be guided in a large measure by the circumstances, you
                                should endeavor at all times to keep the Department of State
                                promptly informed of developments by telegraph and radiotelephone
                                and you should only give your agreement to important measures which
                                may be proposed for the accomplishment of the objectives of the
                                tender of good offices after consultation with the Department.</p>
                            <p>In the tenders and acceptances of good offices the five Governments
                                concerned have agreed that the preliminary discussions should be
                                confined to the examination of measures for the alleviation of the
                                present tension in the relations between the Republics of Honduras
                                and Nicaragua and, once that obstructive tension has been removed,
                                to discuss the means which might be adopted by the two countries
                                with the object of reaching a definitive settlement of the
                                fundamental territorial issue.</p>

                                    practicable after the meeting in San José, it would be desirable
                                    for the representatives of the three countries tendering their
                                    good offices to proceed, in the manner most agreeable to
                                    Honduras and Nicaragua, directly to the territory in dispute for
                                    the purpose of making such initial inspection and studies as may
                                    be necessary, and thereafter, by arrangement, to visit the
                                    capitals of the two countries for discussions with their
                                    governments.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>It is possible that there may be a delay between the preliminary
                                discussions and active examination of the possible bases for a
                                solution of the fundamental issue and, in such event, it may not be
                                practicable for the three governments to maintain their
                                representatives in session in a nearby country. During this period
                                it is possible that new incidents might occur in one or the other
                                country which might impair or even nullify the subsequent
                                negotiations. Accordingly this Government believes that the
                                commission of good offices should constitute in a nearby country a
                                headquarters with a permanent secretariat, the duty of which would
                                be to follow all developments bearing on the controversy, to give
                                study to measures for its solution and to observe the carrying out
                                of measures which may have already been agreed upon. The Department
                                believes that the representatives of the three governments should
                                endeavor to obtain agreement of the two parties to the controversy
                                that they will submit all communications bearing on the controversy
                                to the secretariat of the commission of good offices and that they
                                will facilitate all visits and investigations which the
                                representatives or, in their stead, members of the secretariat, may
                                decide should be made with respect to the controversy.</p>
                            <p>You will be assisted in the performance of your mission by Mr.
                                William P. Cochran, Jr., Foreign Service Officer of the United

                                expressed high personal regard for Dr. Corrigan.</p>
                            <p>As to meeting place Foreign Minister expresses preference for
                                Washington over San José for the following reasons: first, large
                                colony of approximately 25,000 Nicaraguans residing in Costa Rica
                                would possibly exercise a pro-Nicaraguan or disturbing influence;
                                second, uncontrolled radio and press in Costa Rica and proximity to
                                the two countries involved would probably agitate population of both
                                Honduras and Nicaragua with almost daily unauthenticated reports of
                                trend of negotiations and thus increase difficulties of responsible
                                heads of Honduras and Nicaragua in quieting agitation pending
                                settlement; third, all records of previous negotiations and
                                discussions are more accessible in Washington to all parties
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister suggested as alternative in event there is good
                                reason for Washington not being selected, that another country
                                further removed than Costa Rica from internal politics of two
                                disputants be selected.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister will take up immediately with the President
                                naming of Honduran representative, and, in this connection asks the
                                privilege of naming as many as two representatives if Honduras finds
                                this desirable.</p>
                            <p>The question of preventing inflammatory statements in Honduran press
                                and radio is being taken up by the Foreign Minister with the
                                President, so that assurances may be secured.</p>

                                    xml:id="pg_100" facs="0110"/>the United States are in entire
                                accord that both the Governments of Nicaragua and of Honduras should
                                appoint as their representatives at the forthcoming negotiations as
                                many delegates as they respectively consider desirable. For purposes
                                of convenience, it is hoped that neither Government will appoint
                                more than two or three delegates to represent it.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the meeting place for the first sessions, this
                                Government feels sure that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will
                                recognize that the selection of a capital adjacent to the territory
                                in dispute is eminently desirable in order that the representatives
                                of the governments tendering their good offices may visit the
                                territory with facility and with dispatch, and may likewise from
                                time to time visit the capitals of the two Republics involved in the
                                controversy. You should make it clear that it is the opinion of this
                                Government, as it is that of the Governments of Costa Rica and of
                                Venezuela, that the negotiations resulting from the tender of good
                                offices may be divided into two distinct stages, namely, the first
                                for the purpose of suggesting measures to relieve the existing state
                                of tension so that all danger of further friction may be removed,
                                and the second, the period during which the governments tendering
                                their good offices will offer suggestions for a means of finding a
                                definitive solution of the controversy. This second stage of the
                                negotiations may, of course, take place in some capital remote from
                                the Republics of Central America, where a completely neutral
                                atmosphere may be obtained and where the representatives of all of
                                the countries taking part in the negotiations may meet without fear
                                of pressure on public opinion from the press or from the radio. For
                                that reason, this Government believes that San José is the most
                                logical and the most convenient meeting place for the
                                representatives of the five republics during the first stage of the
                                negotiations, and would suggest that Caracas might well be a
                                desirable and convenient capital to be selected for the second stage
                                of the negotiations.</p>
                            <p>For the reasons above set forth, this Government earnestly hopes that
                                the Government of Nicaragua will conclude that the first meeting
                                should take place in San José on November 1st, as already
                                tentatively suggested.</p>
                            <p>The Department desires that you discourage the Government of
                                Nicaragua from continuing to urge Washington as the seat of the
                                negotiations. For reasons of policy it is deemed undesirable that
                                Central American controversies be brought to Washington for
                                solution. This Government will gladly cooperate in every practicable
                                manner in facilitating the pacific solution of controversies of this
                                character, but desires to avoid the impression created in the past
                                that Central American disputes are solved by the United States.</p>

                            <p>156. Department’s telegram No. 74. President Somoza informs me that
                                Nicaragua agrees on San José for the first stage of negotiations,
                                reserving until later date its decision regarding the venue of the
                                second stage. Will probably name two delegates, one a liberal and
                                the other a conservative, each accompanied by a counselor who will
                                not be a delegate. The President says that the delegation will be
                                ready to start negotiations in San José November 1.</p>

                            <p>2. An organization meeting of the Commission was held at 3:00 o’clock
                                this afternoon. Mr. Zuniga Montufar, Foreign Minister of Costa Rica,
                                was named president by joint proposal of the other two members. It
                                was decided to use the designation “Commission for mediation in the
                                border conflict which has arisen between Honduras and Nicaragua”.
                                The Commission will meet again tomorrow morning at 10:00 to receive
                                informally the delegates who are here from Honduras and Nicaragua.
                                It is planned to hold a solemn inaugural session as soon as
                                possible, probably Friday or Saturday.</p>

                            <p>4. The fourth meeting of the Commission, which was a private session,
                                was held yesterday afternoon. A tentative program of procedure was
                                formulated covering the steps to be taken regarding the present
                                crisis, before proceeding to a consideration of the fundamental
                                issue, the boundary controversy. In this connection I presented to
                                the Commission a translation of the suggestions listed in my orders
                                under section 1. The remainder of the meeting was devoted to a
                                discussion of the methods to be followed in receiving the complaints
                                of the delegates of the contending countries and of the technique to
                                be followed in obtaining their agreement to the Commission’s
                                suggestions. It was decided to request the delegates to present
                                briefs giving “a concrete exposition of the events which have
                                occurred in each of <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0113"/>the
                                countries which have caused the present state of tension, without
                                for the moment entering into the fundamental bases of the
                                controversy”.</p>
                            <p>Tactful handling of the numerous press representatives, who are
                                overeager to obtain a front page story daily, presents a real
                                problem. If the Department perceives no objection, I am considering
                                suggesting to the Commission that it invite the press to a special
                                meeting, cite the favorable reception accorded by the peoples of the
                                world to the principles underlying the Buenos Aires and other peace
                                pacts, and frankly to invite them to cooperate with the Commission,
                                in the interests of peace, to give practical effect to these
                                principles, by refraining from the publication of inflammatory
                                editorials and exaggerated, unconfirmed, distorted or invented tales
                                of troop movements, atrocities and so forth. Such a self-imposed
                                restraint might be more effective than any promises by governments
                                to prevent such actions by all the means within their restricted
                                legal powers.</p>
                            <p>Following the afternoon session the Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs and his fellow-delegate called on me by appointment made at
                                their request to complain that the Honduran press is continuing to
                                print inflammatory articles and editorials. He presented me with
                                copies of two recent Honduran newspapers as justification for this
                                complaint. He also desired to apologize on behalf of President
                                Somoza for his not having greeted me at the airport in Managua on
                                Tuesday, stating that he was out of the city at the time and did not
                                know that I was passing through. I gained the impression that
                                Nicaragua would not oppose too strongly a move to refer to
                                arbitration the question of the legality of the award of the King of
                                Spain. The Commission meets again at 3:00 this afternoon.</p>

                            <p>7. The formal meeting of the Mediation Commission at 10:00 this
                                morning was inaugurated by President Leon Cortes of Costa Rica.
                                There were four speeches of some 20 minutes each: One by the
                                President of the Republic welcoming the Commission; one by the
                                President of the Commission is [<hi rend="italic">in</hi>] reply and
                                welcoming the delegations of Honduras and Nicaragua; one by Doctor
                                Silverio Lainez, first Honduran delegate and one by Doctor Manuel
                                Cordero Reyes, first Nicaraguan delegate. All of the speeches
                                displayed a spirit of complete <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104"

                                Complimentary reference was made to George Washington and Simon
                                Bolivar, as the initiators on the American continent of the

                            <p>10. This afternoon’s meeting of the Commission was devoted to
                                consideration of the suggestions to be made by it to the two
                                contending Governments. The first draft suggests that the two
                                Governments make reciprocal offers on the following nine points:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>(1) To abstain from troop mobilizations; (2) to withdraw from
                                        the border and from nearby areas all troops in excess of
                                        those normally maintained there, reverting to the position
                                        on August 1st, and informing the Commission when this has
                                        been accomplished; (3) to suspend immediately all arms
                                        purchases in excess of normal; (4) to prevent flights by
                                        military airplanes over border areas; (5) to give
                                        efficacious protection to citizens of one country resident
                                        in the territory of the other; (6) to avoid the use of
                                        stamps containing maps of either country and to withdraw
                                        those now in circulation (it is hoped by this wording to
                                        save Nicaragua’s face by obtaining withdrawal of the 1925
                                        Honduran stamp as well as the recent Nicaraguan issue); (7)
                                        to invite the press to cooperate and to prevent the
                                        publication of inflammatory articles in order to maintain
                                        the spirit of serenity and cooperation recently adopted by
                                        the press of both nations; (8) to exact a similar attitude
                                        on the part of radio broadcasting stations; (9) the
                                        Commission will request both Governments to inform it of any
                                        happening which might give rise to difficulties of any kind,
                                        and will suggest that such communications be kept
                                        confidential, to prevent their premature publication.</p>

                            <p>I would appreciate the Department’s telegraphic comment and
                                suggestions on these points.</p>

                            <p>5. For Corrigan. Your no. 10, November 12, 9 p.m. I believe that
                                agreement between the parties to the controversy on the points
                                enumerated in your telegram should prove most helpful in preventing
                                a recurrence of tension in their relations, and in that connection I
                                assume that the commission may also wish to give consideration to
                                the desirability of determining the normal strength of frontier
                                garrisons for the purpose of carrying out point 2, and of clarifying
                                the meaning of normal purchases of arms under point 3. With regard
                                to point 6, could this not be extended to include maps?</p>

                            <p>16. Taking into consideration the viewpoints of the two delegations,
                                the Commission yesterday afternoon modified several of its
                                recommendations. <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0116"/>Point 1
                                now provides that each Government shall notify the Commission of the
                                numbers and places of troops maintained on or near the border on
                                August 1, before the present tension arose. Point 2 provides for the
                                reestablishment of this situation, the withdrawal of excess troops
                                to be commenced immediately and completion of the withdrawal to be
                                reported to the Commission. Point 3 provides that both Governments
                                shall immediately suspend all arms purchases for a period of 6
                                months, exception being made for contracts already signed and in
                                execution. The other changes were unimportant. These suggestions
                                will be prepared in proper form tomorrow and it is planned to
                                deliver them to the two delegations on Friday.</p>
                            <p>The first Nicaraguan delegate today presented informally to the
                                President of the Commission the information contained in telegram
                                No. 171, November 16, 6 p.m.,<note n="57" xml:id="d119fn57">Not
                                    printed.</note> from Managua to the Department. The Commission
                                felt that such incidents, and press leaks (as reported in my
                                telegram No. 15 of November 17, 11 a.m.<note n="57"
                                    xml:id="d119fn58">Not printed.</note> and recurring in this
                                morning’s newspapers, from what I am convinced are local sources)
                                imperilled the mediation. Early completion and presentation of the
                                Commission’s recommendations was therefore decided upon.</p>

                            <p>17. For the Under Secretary. The 10 points of mediation approved by
                                the Commission were signed and delivered to the two delegations
                                tonight and I have every hope that they will be accepted by the two
                                Governments. This will relieve present tension but I am not so
                                sanguine as to the future. The only real way to avoid war is to
                                settle the basic boundary controversy. I feel there is a real desire
                                to settle the matter once and for all on the part of Nicaragua, and
                                an equally real disposition to compromise in order to obtain this
                                end. I cannot say as much for the attitude of Honduras, which takes
                                the stand in public and in private that the Mediation Commission
                                exists not to conciliate a dispute as to the frontier, but to <hi
                                    rend="italic">force</hi> Nicaragua to accept the line of the
                                award of the King of Spain as the definitive boundary. I seriously
                                doubt if Honduras would be willing, for example, to cede certain
                                territory on the left bank of the Cocos River <pb n="107"
                                    xml:id="pg_107" facs="0117"/>and the lands between it and the
                                Cruta to Nicaragua in return for acceptance by the latter of the
                                principle of the validity of the King’s award, the most reasonable
                                solution which occurs to me so far, since the villages lying in
                                these territories have long been Nicaraguan by every standard and
                                could not be abandoned by Nicaragua. Furthermore, I seriously doubt
                                that Honduras will consent even to submit the validity of the award
                                to arbitration and fear that any peaceful gesture on the part of the
                                Honduran Government would be rejected by the people of the country,
                                in their present temper. I, therefore, consider that it might be
                                desirable for the Commission to recess if or after the Protocol is
                                signed, to allow time for passions to cool and for diplomatic
                                approaches to Carias, in the hope that modification of the present
                                    <hi rend="italic">intransigeant</hi> attitude of Honduras can be
                                obtained. I regretfully repeat my belief that the full moral
                                pressure of the United States will be necessary to induce Honduras
                                to make any concession whatsoever in the interest of peace. This
                                mediation cannot be permitted to fail, or the entire structure so
                                carefully erected at Buenos Aires falls to the ground.</p>

                            <p>21. The Nicaraguan reply to the 10 suggestions made by the Commission
                                was delivered officially last night. Nicaragua accepts basically all
                                the points and is disposed to sign a convention putting them into
                                effect. It desires to add, however, certain “natural additions”
                                within the bases recommended, leading to the certainty of proper
                                compliance. These latter suggestions are to be communicated to the
                                Commission at the proper time. The Commission considers the reply
                                very satisfactory.</p>

                            <p>25. The reply of the Honduran Government was not delivered until 4:30
                                this afternoon although it came in yesterday’s air mail. Important
                                changes considered contribute to a bad impression which the reply
                                has made on the Mediation Commission. The 10 suggestions hereafter
                                referred to as “points” are reduced to 8 by combining points 1 and 2
                                and eliminating point 7 which refers to the non-use of stamp maps.
                                The changes made by merging points 1 and 2 are technical and not of
                                basic importance.</p>
                            <p>Point 5 (Honduran number 4) adds “except in case of a revolution in
                                said frontier regions”.</p>
                            <p>Point 6 (Honduran number 5) insert after the words “protection”, “in
                                accordance with the law”.</p>
                            <p>Point 7 eliminated with a statement that Honduras has been using its
                                official map on stamps since 1926.</p>
                            <p>Points 8 and 9 of our draft now to be considered as Honduran points 6
                                and 7 are accepted without alteration.</p>

                                would receive the approval of their Government: <list>
                                    <item>[Point] 6. A mutual offer by both Governments not to use

                            <p>31. Secretary Izaguirre appeared before the Commission this morning
                                and suggested slight changes in text desired by the Honduran <pb
                                    n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0120"/>delegation. These having
                                been made to his satisfaction, the Commission in order to avoid
                                further objections and delays added a reassuring paragraph which
                                also received Izaguirre’s hearty approval. This tenth point and the
                                nine already reported seem to be acceptable to the Honduran
                                delegation. Confirmation of their decision is hoped for by Monday.
                                The new point 10 reads as follows in free translation: “It is
                                clearly and explicitly understood that none of the foregoing offers
                                affects in any way the fundamental issues of the boundary
                                controversy that has arisen between Honduras and Nicaragua.”</p>
                            <p>In view of the possible early conclusion of this phase of the
                                Commission’s work, the organization of a permanent Secretariat was

                            <p>33. In the conference held this afternoon with the Nicaraguan
                                delegates they declared their readiness to sign a protocol
                                incorporating the points agreed on up to the present time and with
                                respect to the elimination of point No. 6, referred to in my
                                telegram No. 32, of today. They stated the retention or elimination
                                of this point referring to stamps would not alter their willingness
                                to sign.</p>
                            <p>If this point does not cause delay the protocol is likely to be
                                signed within a few days. The matter of a permanent secretariat is
                                now under discussion.</p>

                            <p>42. There is being considered the formation of a board of military
                                experts to supervise and report on the carrying out of the military
                                provisions of the pact just signed between Honduras and Nicaragua.
                                Please instruct me as to whether or not the Government of the United
                                States desires to appoint a military expert to serve on such a
                                board. It is understood that the expenses would be met by the
                                Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>

                            <p>16. For Corrigan. Your 42, December 13, 3 p.m. It is my understanding
                                that among the principal functions of the permanent Secretariat now
                                under consideration would be to receive complaints which <pb n="115"
                                    xml:id="pg_115" facs="0125"/>might be made by either party to
                                the agreement of violations thereof and to take appropriate action
                                after proper investigation of the facts. While it is possible that
                                the Secretariat might later require the services of neutral military
                                observers to investigate specific complaints of alleged violations
                                of the military clauses of the agreement, I am of the opinion that
                                the Commission should rely primarily on the good faith of the
                                parties to the agreement for its fulfillment, and hence that the
                                formation at this juncture “of a board of military experts to
                                supervise and report on the carrying out of the military provisions”
                                might not be desirable. I should appreciate receiving your comments
                                on the foregoing before instructing you definitely.</p>
                            <p>You may however inform the other members of the commission that this
                                Government would be prepared to detail the American Military Attaché
                                resident in Panama, Colonel Joseph B. Pate, to cooperate with other
                                neutral military observers in the investigation of an alleged
                                violation of military clauses of the agreement in a particular case
                                which had arisen if such action appeared to be necessary after
                                consideration of the facts.</p>

                            <p>17. For Corrigan. As will be seen from a study of the memorandum
                                attached to the Department’s instruction of December 11, 1937,<note
                                    n="65" xml:id="d136fn65">Not printed.</note> at the time the
                                three Governments tendered their good offices to the Governments of
                                Nicaragua and Honduras there was some discussion between them, as
                                well as with the Nicaraguan and Honduran authorities, with regard to
                                the seat of the conference. Although no written understanding was
                                formulated, it was our understanding that it was agreed that it
                                would be desirable, (1), that the seat of the conference during the
                                preliminary stage be near the two disputant countries in order to
                                facilitate the formulation of the protocol; (2), that once this
                                protocol had been signed, a permanent secretariat should be
                                established at San José to observe compliance with the terms of the
                                protocol; and (3), that the seat of the further discussions be
                                removed from Central America in order that these might take place in
                                a dispassionate atmosphere. At the time Caracas was mentioned as a
                                suitable seat for the second stage of the conference.</p>
                            <p>Under instructions from his Government, the Minister of Honduras
                                today called at the Department and recalled that his Government had,
                                in agreeing to San José, made reservations with regard to continuing
                                    <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0126"/>at San José during the
                                second stage. He indicated that his Government would look with favor
                                upon the selection of Caracas.</p>
                            <p>This matter was discussed informally with the Costa Rican Minister
                                today. He recalled the discussions regarding the seat of the
                                conference, and stated that he had not informed his Government in
                                detail regarding them, but had merely indicated to his Government
                                that it might expect that after the first stage of the conference
                                was over there might be discussions with regard to the seat of the
                                conference for the second stage. To date he has had no indication as
                                to what the attitude of his Government might be, although he stated
                                his personal belief that his Government would of course wish to
                                follow the desires of Nicaragua and Honduras in this regard.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances the Department is concerned because of the
                                press report referred to in your telegram no. 44 of December 15, 2
                                p.m. Please seek an immediate interview with the Minister of Foreign
                                Relations and, after stating that the report referred to is
                                incorrect, make clear to him that the Department has no fixed
                                attitude with regard to the seat of the second stage of the
                                conference but, on the other hand, is prepared to agree to whatever
                                is satisfactory to the disputant governments and to the other
                                governments extending good offices. In particular, an effort should
                                be made to disabuse any belief that the Minister may have that this
                                Government and Venezuela have engaged in conversations with the
                                object of deciding where the seat of the second stage of the
                                conference shall be.</p>
                            <p>The best manner of handling this delicate matter is left to your
                                discretion. However, you might suggest to the Minister and to the
                                Venezuelan delegate that the preferences of the two disputant
                                governments should be the guiding considerations in the decision and
                                that it would be well, therefore, to ascertain directly from the
                                delegations the desires of their respective governments.</p>

                            <p>97. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 44, December 30, 3 p.m. As
                                stated in numbered paragraph 2 of my telegram number 95, December
                                27, noon, all members of the Commission agreed between them not to
                                visit Honduras and Nicaragua at this time. Consequently, I would be
                                embarrassed should I myself visit those countries without prior
                                consultation with my colleagues on the Commission.</p>
                            <p>With the following objective in mind, Ocheltree’s visits to
                                Tegucigalpa and Managua were suggested: (1) to obtain through his
                                established personal acquaintance with the Honduran and Nicaraguan
                                delegates and his familiarity with the negotiations information
                                usefully supplemental to that furnished by our Legations, (2) to
                                broaden his knowledge of the Central American scene and thereby to
                                increase his usefulness to the special mission. See air mail

                                Spain would retain full sovereignty over the above-mentioned

                                agriculture of any kind. Great Britain would withdraw from the
                                territory occupied by its subjects, handing it over to the Spanish
                                Government, its legitimate owner, and only they could settle as

                                the south, prolonging it from the Hondo River to the Sibún River. In
                                exchange for that extension, England was obliged to withdraw from
                                the territory of Mosquitia along the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua.
                                The restriction of engaging in agriculture, erecting fortifications
                                and maintaining armed troops was reiterated,—it being stated
                                explicitly that the sovereignty of Spain in that region was
                                maintained integrally, in which region the English were granted no
                                other right than that of cutting timber of various kinds.</p>
                            <p>Again Great Britain did not comply with its solemn agreement and the
                                usurpation became more ostensible, to such an extreme that it not
                                only established its dominion up to the marked boundary of the Sibún
                                River, but in reality, by successive invasions advanced to the

                                depriving Guatemala of all the territory of Belize comprised under
                                the former sovereignty of the Spanish Government, succeeded in that
                                sovereignty, thanks to its independence by the Republic of Central
                                America, and by the Republic of Guatemala, afterwards; being
                                deprived, therefore, of its natural outlet to the sea, the rich and
                                vast territory of Petén to the north of the Republic.</p>
                            <p>In 1834 Guatemala, in exercise of its sovereign authority, entered
                                into contracts for exploitation of lumber to the south of the Sibún
                                River. Great Britain opposed those contracts, preventing their
                                fulfillment, with no more reason than that of force exercised over a
                                young and weak country. She could not allege, in any case, any right
                                other than that of conquest acquired in the Anglo-Spanish struggles
                                at the end of the XVIII Century; but even that supposed right was
                                annulled by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802,<note n="7"

                                which was a motive for just misgivings on the part of the United

                                national life; and the advance would have been unchecked if the
                                Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1859, entered into between that Republic
                                and Great Britain had not placed a dike against English expansion on

                                Seventh Article, which imposed on Great Britain the obligation of
                                constructing a road which would place the northern coast of the

                                except in the part favoring it. Under the pretext that the cost of
                                the road amounted to one hundred and forty-five thousand four

                                exchange had expired; but there was a change in the English
                                Government, and the new Secretary, Lord Stanley, categorically
                                refused to recognize the existence of the agreement, declaring on
                                his own initiative that his Government was relieved from compliance
                                with its obligations. But, if in conformity with the unilateral
                                English opinion, the supplementary Treaty of 1863 is not in force,
                                the two parties are now confronted by that of 1859 which is in force
                                because it has been invested with all the necessary formalities.</p>
                            <p>But even in this case, the Government of Guatemala believes, based on
                                the fundamental rules of International Law and on logical rules of
                                international ethics, that if the Treaty of April 30, 1859 has not
                                been fulfilled in the part referring to the obligations contracted
                                by one of the Parties, the said Treaty has no juridical existence;
                                or at least, there are sufficient reasons, based on international
                                law, to ask for its nullification.</p>
                            <p>Guatemala, nevertheless, desires to exhaust all conciliatory means
                                and has not ceased to negotiate for many years for integral
                                compliance with the Treaty; but everything has been useless, and it
                                is convinced that it will not receive justice unless the spirit in

                                [James] Brown Scott have studied the question of Belize, which is

                                certainly coincides with mine in this important matter.</p>
                            <p>The present juridical situation of the problem can be summarized in
                                the following points:</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">First</hi></p>
                            <p>The Treaty of April 30, 1859, by which Guatemala recognized as
                                belonging to Great Britain a territorial area up to the Sarstoon
                                River is unfulfilled by England in so far as the obligations which
                                it contracted with the Republic of Guatemala are concerned.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Second</hi></p>
                            <p>The non-fulfillment of a Treaty by one of the Contracting Parties
                                gives the other the right to ask for its abrogation.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Third</hi></p>
                            <p>The immediate effect of the invalidation or abrogation of a Treaty is
                                to return affairs to the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi>.
                                Consequently, the Republic of Guatemala has the right to regain
                                possession of the territory of Belize, thus completing its Atlantic
                                coast, along which it has been almost strangled and without
                                possibilities, for a future which may be deemed immediate, for
                                exporting petroleum which surely exists because of inevitable
                                geological reasons, as well as raw materials of the greatest
                                importance, in the above-mentioned department of Petén, opposite
                                Belize. This colony, furthermore, because of its being a free port
                                for English merchandise, is a center of smuggling which greatly
                                prejudices the commerce of Guatemala and Honduras. For that same
                                reason and because of its strategic situation, it was also a point
                                of departure for numerous expeditions of liquor smugglers to the
                                United States when prohibition was in force—and nothing prevents
                                illicit activities from being carried on from there in the
                                future.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Fourth</hi></p>
                            <p>The reservation of Great Britain to the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty when it
                                was submitted for approval to the Senate of the United States in no
                                way affected the rights of Guatemala because it was not a party
                                thereto.</p>

                            <p>Guatemala, as the successor of Spain, has the right to recover all
                                the territories which belonged to it prior to the Treaty of 1783,
                                non-fulfilled by Great Britain.</p>

                                proposed, on the 18th of last August, to conclude this matter by
                                payment to the Government of Guatemala of the fifty thousand pounds
                                referred to in the above-mentioned Convention of 1863, by which its
                                obligations would be cancelled and Guatemala would have no right to
                                any later claim.</p>
                            <p>Based on the right supporting it and on equity, my Government
                                verbally offered the Legation the replies contained in the two
                                following counter proposals, with the understanding that acceptance
                                by Great Britain of either of them would end this long and annoying
                                matter; the Legation has refused to take them into

                                to the sea. Said strip shall be located in the parallel 16°8ʹ39ʹʹ,

                                of Petén bordering Belize may have an exit to the sea. That strip
                                would be such that there would be comprised within it, the mouth of
                                the Grande River, Punta Gorda and the Cayos de Zapotillo. Those

                            <p>This is the present state of the question, from which the justice
                                supporting Guatemala appears clearly proved. If the Department of

                                to interpose its moral prestige, which I courteously beg of you, in
                                favor of the right of Guatemala in this matter, you would receive
                                one more claim to the appreciation of our Nation which already owes
                                so much to the counsel and always friendly good offices of that

                            After consideration, we have come to the conclusion that a request in
                            this language is not a proper basis upon which to approach Great
                            Britain. If Great Britain were not informed of the precise terms of
                            Guatemala’s request, and later learned them, it probably would feel that
                            it had good reason to be resentful at us. If we did inform Great Britain
                            of the precise terms of Guatemala’s request, it probably would feel that
                            it could not accept good offices.</p>

                                suggesting that the Government of the United States “interpose its
                                moral prestige in favor of the right of Guatemala” in facilitating a
                                settlement of the controversy between your Government and that of
                                Great Britain concerning the interpretation of Article VII of the

                                countries.</p>

                            <p>It is assumed that Your Excellency’s request contemplates the
                                extension of good offices on the part of the United States to the
                                end that a solution of the controversy satisfactory to Guatemala and
                                Great Britain may be reached. Should this assumption be correct, I
                                am glad to state that the Government of the United States will make
                                available its good offices in the event that the British Government
                                joins with that of Guatemala in requesting such good offices.</p>
                            <p>If Your Excellency had in mind the submission of the controversy to
                                arbitration by the United States, my Government would of course be
                                glad to consider the possibility of acting as arbitrator in the
                                matter, provided Guatemala and Great Britain jointly requested its
                                assistance in that sense.</p>
                            <p>I shall be glad to give further consideration to Your Excellency’s

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on August
                            19, 1937, in an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I
                            informally called to his attention the fact that no reply had as yet
                            been made to Secretary Hull’s note of February 13, 1937, in which the
                            United States consented to make available its good offices in the
                            solution of the boundary controversy between Guatemala and Great
                            Britain, provided both governments concerned would make the joint
                            request, and in which the Guatemalan Government was asked for a
                            clarification of the scope of its request.</p>
                        <p>Minister Salazar went into great detail to explain the matter, stating
                            that the question had been under consideration for some time and that
                            only recently definite information had been received from the British
                            Government that arbitration by the United States was not acceptable to
                            it but offering to place the case before the Hague Court. The Foreign
                            Minister said that this suggestion had not met with favor with his
                            Government as it feared that because of Great Britain’s influence at the
                            Hague the Guatemalan claim might not receive the full justice it
                            merited. However, Dr. José Matos, who was this country’s representative
                            to the Coronation of King George VI, was instructed to make a thorough
                            study of the matter while in England with particular reference to past
                            decisions of the Court and the <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0141"
                            />character and nationality of the judges who might be called upon to
                            settle the claim.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Salazar said that upon the return of Dr. Matos to
                            Guatemala today, the question is to be very carefully considered and he
                            expressed the belief that his Government will suggest a compromise
                            whereby the United States Government or President Roosevelt be asked to
                            select the arbitration judges.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Mallet said that he was coming in quite informally to let the
                            Department know of a recent action taken by the British Government with
                            regard to the boundary dispute between British Honduras and Guatemala.
                            He said that the Guatemalan Government had proposed to the British
                            Government that the boundary difficulty be submitted to arbitration and
                            that the arbitrator be the President of the United States. He then said
                            that the British Government had informed the Guatemalan Minister in
                            London on August 17 that it would be glad to agree to arbitration of the
                            dispute, but that it would prefer that the arbitration be not in the
                            hands of the President of the United States, but in the Hague Court. Mr.
                            Mallet stated that the British Government wanted this Government to know
                            that in suggesting the Hague Court the British Government was casting no
                            reflection upon the impartiality or good faith of the President of the
                            United States. He said that for some time it has been the invariable
                            practice of the British Government to submit to the Hague disputes of a
                            legal character.</p>
                        <p>I assured Mr. Mallet that the point of view of his Government was fully
                            understood.</p>

                            despatches relative to the boundary difficulties between Guatemala and
                            British Honduras and the desire of this country to have the matter
                            arbitrated <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0142"/>by President
                            Roosevelt, I have the honor to inform the Department that Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs Salazar stated to me recently that he had had further
                            conversations with the British Minister to Guatemala and that the latter
                            had suggested the willingness of his Government to have the matter
                            arbitrated, if not by the Court of International Justice at The Hague,
                            by any other European power or authority acceptable to Guatemala.
                            Minister Salazar said that he informed the Minister that Guatemala would
                            not go outside of the continent to arbitrate the difficulty. He then
                            made a counter-offer to the British Minister, informing him that
                            Guatemala would consider the matter settled if Great Britain would
                            consent to the moving of the frontier of Guatemala from its present
                            line, the River Sarstoon, northward approximately twenty-five miles to
                            the Rio Grande which enters the Caribbean immediately above Punta Gorda
                            in British Honduran territory.</p>
                        <p>It appears that Guatemalan authorities would be eminently satisfied with
                            this concession since it would give a convenient and practical outlet by
                            sea from the Petén district of the country. This offer, however, was
                            flatly rejected by the British Minister as being unacceptable to his
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>29. The President last night received the telegram from the President of
                            Haiti requesting this Government to join with the Governments of Cuba
                            and of Mexico in tendering their good offices to Haiti and the Dominican
                            Republic in the controversy which has arisen between them. The President
                            intends sending a reply to the President of Haiti by telegram which
                            reply will be sent in more or less identic terms by the Presidents of
                            Cuba and of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of telegram dated November 14 from President Roosevelt

                            tentatively agreed upon:</p>

                        <p>In view of the statement volunteered to you by President Trujillo that he
                            would avail himself of the friendly services of the Government of the
                            United States should the latter consider it desirable to make the effort
                            to facilitate a pacific solution of the controversy, it is assumed that
                            President Trujillo will welcome the friendly offer of the three
                            Governments named.</p>
                        <p>It would presumably be useful for you at this juncture to seek a further
                            conversation with President Trujillo, to emphasize the friendly and
                            impartial spirit of the Government of the United States in the
                            controversy, and its hope that its friendly offices together with those
                            of Cuba and of Mexico, if accepted, may serve to bring a prompt solution
                            satisfactory both to the Dominican Republic and to Haiti.</p>
                        <p>Please keep the Department informed by telegram of any developments.</p>

                        <p>105. The President last night received from the President of Haiti the
                            anticipated invitation to join with Cuba and Mexico in a tender of good
                            offices in the dispute which has arisen between Haiti and the Dominican
                            Republic. The President intends to send a reply to the President of
                            Haiti worded as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of telegram dated November 14 from President Roosevelt
                            to the President of Haiti, printed on <ref target="#pg_135">page
                                135</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>He likewise intends to send a telegram to the President of the Dominican
                            Republic couched in the following terms:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of telegram dated November 14 from President Roosevelt
                            to the President of the Dominican Republic, printed on <ref
                                target="#pg_136">page 136</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>It would seem to be desirable that these messages sent individually by
                            the three Presidents should be as similar in text as possible and that
                            they be sent simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>Please obtain the point of view of the Government of Cuba with regard to
                            the texts above quoted and suggest that should the Government of Cuba be
                            in accord, the telegrams both to the President of Haiti and to the
                            President of the Dominican Republic be sent at the same hour from
                            Habana, Mexico City, and Washington. I suggest that 7 p.m., tomorrow,
                            November 14, might be a convenient hour to the three Governments
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph me as promtly as possible what the decision of the
                            Government of Cuba may be. You may state that the Government of Mexico
                            is in accord with the texts indicated.</p>

                        <p>90. Your No. 105, November 13, 7 p.m. The Cuban Secretary of State whom I
                            saw this afternoon showed me the texts of the telegrams sent by his
                            Government yesterday morning to the Presidents of Haiti and the
                            Dominican Republic which are of the same import as those which the
                            President of the United States proposes to send.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban Government is therefore in full concurrence and proposes to
                            appoint as its representative the Cuban Minister to the <pb n="135"
                                xml:id="pg_135" facs="0145"/>Dominican Republic. In answer to the
                            Secretary’s inquiry as to our representative and that of Mexico I said
                            that I assumed that Norweb would be proposed in view of his return to
                            his post although a delegate to the Radio Conference but that I had no
                            information as to the representative of Mexico.</p>

                            Excellency’s telegram dated November 12,<note n="1" xml:id="d152fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> advising me that a situation of tension has
                            unhappily arisen between Your Excellency’s Government and that of the
                            Dominican Republic to the prejudice of the present interests of the two
                            peoples and to the harmony of their future friendship. Your Excellency
                            states that, inspired by the spirit of friendship and solidarity
                            advocated by the inter-American agreements concluded in the interest of
                            the maintenance of peace between the peoples of this hemisphere, you
                            request the good offices of the Government of the United States in
                            aiding in a just and prompt solution of the difference now existing
                            between the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Your
                            Excellency further advises me that you are making the same request of
                            the Presidents of Cuba and of Mexico in the hope that they may be
                            associated with the Government of the United States in this work of
                            justice and of humanity.</p>
                        <p>I have learned with profound regret of the controversy which has
                            unfortunately arisen between our sister republics of Haiti and of the
                            Dominican Republic. The Government of the United States possesses no
                            more sincere hope than that the maintenance of peace between the
                            American Republics may be firmly assured and that the friendship and
                            understanding between them may be constantly enhanced. In the hope that
                            it may thereby promote that ideal, the Government of the United States
                            stands ready to join in extending its friendly services in an effort to
                            further the attainment of a pacific solution of the present controversy,
                            satisfactory to both parties thereto, and in the event that these good
                            offices likewise prove acceptable to the Government of the Dominican
                            Republic, it will be happy, jointly with the Governments of Cuba and of
                            Mexico, to tender its good offices to Your Excellency’s Government and
                            to the Government of the Dominican Republic.</p>

                            subject of controversy in connection with the incident mentioned, the
                            Dominican Government will hasten to define its line of action as to
                            whether it accepts or whether mediation or good offices shall proceed.
                            Respecting the noble spirit of pacifism that inspired the conventions
                            signed by the nations of America at the recent Buenos Aires Conference,
                            and still in agreement with the said conventions, which constitute the
                            highest example of Pan American concord and solidarity, the Dominican
                            Government will bear in mind the lofty purpose of those treaties and
                            will subject its conduct at all times to the stipulations of the
                            same.</p>

                                    (1) that regrettable incidents involving the loss of life of an
                                    undetermined number of Haitian citizens had occurred in the
                                    Dominican Republic; (2) that direct negotiation between the two

                                    Government should accept the formal tender of good offices, a
                                    Commission composed of representatives to be designated by the

                                    for the settlement of the questions in connection with which it

                                    of Cuba, to exercise your good offices before my Government,
                                    there is now no absence of grounds for seeking the formula for

                                    cherished of giving the Government and people of Haiti the most
                                    complete satisfaction with regard to any legitimate claim that

                            to his office today and explained to them separately in turn that he was

                                the political motive in the concurrent offenses. Terrorists shall

                                of the locality, if it occurred outside the capital, unless serious

                                dangerous for the security of the refugees.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Article v</hi>. While the asylum lasts, the

                                with the exterior without their expressed approval. Should they
                                refuse or violate any of these conditions, the diplomatic agent or
                                commander shall immediately cause the asylum to cease.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Article vi</hi>. The government of the State may
                                require that the refugee be placed outside the national territory,
                                as soon as possible; and the diplomatic agent or commander who has
                                granted the asylum may on his part demand the necessary guarantees
                                in order that the refugee may leave the country, the inviolability
                                of his person being duly respected. Should those guarantees not
                                exist, the evacuation may be put off until the local authorities
                                facilitate them.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Article vii</hi>. Once the refugees have left
                                the country, they may not be landed in any part of the same. In the
                                case that an ex-refugee returned to that country to take part in the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Article viii</hi>. When the number of refugees
                                exceed the normal capacity of the places of refuge set down in
                                Article II, the diplomatic agents or commanders may provide other
                                places, under the protection of their flag for their shelter and
                                lodging. In such case they have to ask for the consent of the
                                authorities.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Article ix</hi>. Warships or military aircrafts

                                persecuted for political offenses or reasons; but the country of

                                country from which they come.</p>
                            <p>The political refugees shall not be allowed to set up committees or

                                promoting or furthering disturbances of the established order in any
                                of the territories of the Contracting Parties. Such boards or
                                committees shall be dissolved, once their subversive nature has been
                                verified by the authorities of the State in which they are.</p>
                            <p>The propagation of ideas shall be ruled according to the legal
                                provisions of the country of refuge.</p>

                                over and remove to a prudent distance of its frontiers those
                                political emigrants who were notoriously known as leaders of a

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to
                                Your Excellency’s note of July 27, 1937 transmitting a draft
                                “Convention on the Right of Asylum” and requesting that I obtain the
                                opinion of my Government with respect thereto. Copies of Your
                                Excellency’s note under reference and its enclosure were duly
                                submitted to my Government, and I have now been authorized to submit
                                the following views on the project in question.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States of America views with profound
                                sympathy all sincere efforts directed towards the establishment of
                                relations between nations on an orderly and civilized basis
                                consistent with the basic principles of international law and with
                                the higher ideals of humanitarianism. It is in such a spirit that my
                                Government has given careful consideration to the provisions of the
                                draft convention on asylum which has been submitted to it for study,
                                particularly in view of the distinguished sponsorship of this new
                                proposal, and the noble motives which have inspired it. With respect
                                to the basic objective of clarifying the problems relating to the
                                general subject of asylum, and with respect to the desirability of
                                taking all practical measures for the promotion of cultured and
                                civilized human relations, there can be no disagreement. However,
                                with respect to the most feasible means for achieving these
                                desirable ends, my Government regrets to observe that its considered
                                policy is one which would render it difficult to adhere to the
                                provisions set forth in the proposed convention.</p>
                            <p>My Government feels that the recognition of the so-called right of
                                asylum on such broad terms as those set forth in the draft
                                convention would involve an extension of the traditional immunities
                                and privileges <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0158"/>enjoyed by
                                diplomatic representatives transcending the original purposes for
                                which such immunities and privileges were created, namely, to accord
                                full protection and freedom from interference to the diplomatic
                                representatives of one state within the territorial jurisdiction of
                                another, with a view to promoting peaceful and orderly relations
                                between those states. For these privileges and immunities to be
                                extended in the manner contemplated by the proposed convention might
                                give rise to certain complications which, in the opinion of my
                                Government, might run counter to the basic objective
                                contemplated.</p>
                            <p>As Your Excellency is aware, the point of view set forth above is
                                consistent with the traditional policy of the Government of the
                                United States of America. It will be recalled that at the Sixth
                                International Conference of American States, which convened at
                                Habana, Cuba, in 1928, there was adopted a convention fixing the
                                rules for the granting of asylum. In signing this convention on
                                behalf of its Government, the Delegation of the United States of
                                America made the following specific reservation: <quote

                            <p>Subsequently at the Seventh International Conference of American
                                States, which convened at Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1933, there was
                                presented to the Conference for approval a “Convention on Political
                                Asylum”. With respect to this convention the Delegation of the
                                United States of America made the following declaration: <quote

                                        asylum, the delegation of the United States of America
                                        refrains from signing the present Convention on Political
                                            Asylum.”<note n="12" xml:id="d160fn12"><hi rend="italic"

                            <p>It is the sincere desire of my Government to consolidate, so far as
                                possible its traditional policy with such agreements as may be made
                                between the other American states. However, in the light of the
                                considerations set forth above, which are believed to be in accord
                                with public opinion in my country, the Government of the United

                            and one-half years the Administration has been making a determined
                            effort to place the relations of the United States with the other
                            American Republics on a solid basis of friendship, mutual respect and
                            fruitful cooperation. The result of this effort has been extremely
                            gratifying. The American Republics which heretofore have viewed the
                            United States with suspicion and even distrust today hold the United
                            States as a friend and real neighbor, sensitive to their rights and
                            interests and desirous of cooperating with them to the fullest
                            measure.</p>
                        <p>Indicative of this growing friendship, which is one of the most
                            heartening developments in our foreign relations, have been the numerous
                            requests for friendly assistance which have been received from the
                            American Republics. We have been requested to loan the services of
                            technical experts or to give technical advice regarding a wide range of
                            subjects, such as highway construction, education, agriculture,
                            government finance, sanitation, aviation, et cetera, and whenever
                            appropriate we have been glad to comply with these requests. In the
                            present letter I should like to present you with information regarding a
                            somewhat different type of request and to lay before you the views of
                            the President and bespeak for them your interest and cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Recently the Government of Brazil has informed this Government of its
                            increasing concern with certain tendencies of the world political
                            situation. The desire on the part of some nations for access to raw
                            materials, and the forceful action taken by those nations to consummate
                            these desires, has made Brazil, a country of vast territory and
                            relatively small population, particularly apprehensive. The Government,
                            therefore, has thought it the part of prudence to improve its relatively
                            modest national defense, but being deficient in trained military or
                            naval personnel and equipment, it finds its task a considerable one.</p>
                        <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0160"/>
                        <p>With respect to naval defense, the Brazilian Government is constructing
                            certain vessels and purchasing others abroad. Upon the construction or
                            delivery of these vessels, the Government will be the possessor of what
                            it considers to be necessary naval material, but, unless steps are taken
                            meanwhile, there will be a dearth of trained personnel to operate its
                            ships. In order to remedy this deficiency the Government of Brazil has
                            inquired whether the Government of the United States would be disposed
                            to lease six of its decommissioned destroyers until its own vessels are
                            ready.</p>
                        <p>This request of the Government of Brazil has had the very careful
                            consideration of the President, of the Navy Department and of this
                            Department. The President believes, and his views are shared by the two
                            executive departments concerned, that there are two weighty reasons
                            which commend the proposal. In the first place, if the governments of
                            the other countries of this hemisphere find it necessary to turn to
                            foreign governments for assistance in a matter of this character, it
                            would be preferable, for obvious reasons, that such assistance be
                            extended by the United States rather than by some other foreign
                            government. Secondly, it would appear to be in the interest of this
                            country were its over-age vessels now decommissioned because of the
                            expense involved to be kept in running order and available for instant
                            use, which would be the case if they were leased under the proper terms
                            and conditions to other countries of this hemisphere. These over-age
                            vessels are being retained by the Navy Department at the present time
                            only because of their value in case of an emergency, but their value is
                            greatly lessened because it requires approximately two months working at
                            top speed twenty-four hours a day properly to recommission vessels which
                            have been retired from active service. For these principal reasons, the
                            President is disposed to consider favorably the Brazilian request, it
                            being understood, of course, that no such equipment would be loaned by
                            this Government except when the public interests rendered such a course
                            advisable, and when the equipment in question could be spared without
                            any impairment of the defense requirements of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In order that this Government may be in a position to take such action as
                            that indicated above, the President has requested me to submit for the
                            consideration and study of your Committee a draft resolution which will
                            authorize him under certain conditions to loan destroyers to the
                            American Republics. You will observe that such action would be
                            predicated upon the application of the foreign government concerned, and
                            would be authorized whenever, in the discretion of the President, the
                            public interests rendered such a course advisable. In Section 2 of the
                            draft resolution it is provided that there shall be received as
                            consideration for the lease of such vessels an amount equivalent to the
                            total cost of marine insurance on the vessels for the entire <pb n="151"
                                xml:id="pg_151" facs="0161"/>period of the lease. It is understood,
                            of course, that this Government would not proceed to make available any
                            of its naval vessels to Brazil without making a similar offer to the
                            other countries of this hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>At the President’s direction, I am addressing similar letters to the
                            Chairmen of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Senate Committee
                            on Naval Affairs and the House Committee on Naval Affairs. The President
                            would appreciate your conferring with the Chairman of these other
                            Committees, and if you concur in his views to arrange for immediate
                            consideration by the Congress of the attached resolution, which it is
                            hoped may be adopted at this session of Congress.</p>

                        <p>83. Acting under the Department’s instruction of August 9, 6 p.m. I today
                            presented the Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="4" xml:id="d163fn4"
                                >E. Gil Borges.</note> an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                            embodying the contents of the Department’s message. The Foreign Minister
                            had been considering the matter as reported in the press and said that
                            while it was to be expected that the proposal would be criticized in
                            Europe he saw nothing in it to cause any apprehension in Latin America.
                            He confessed that while he did not understand the reason for the
                            proposal he saw no reason for distrusting the motive of the United
                            States. He took occasion to express even more cordially than in any
                            previous conversation the confidence of himself and of his Government in
                            the sincere friendliness and good will of the United States toward the
                            Latin American states.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed deep concern based on current
                            developments in Europe and Asia as to the peace of the world and
                            reiterated several times his conviction that the hope of the future for
                            this hemisphere depended upon its solidarity of aim and action. He
                            stated that Venezuela would strongly advocate such solidarity at the
                            Eighth Pan American Conference at Lima.<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">See

                            mentioned Japanese immigration and economic expansion as one of the
                            principal threats to Latin America but added that Japanese penetration
                            was not now a serious problem in Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister was willing that I communicate to the Department
                            without delay his reaction to the proposed resolution but said that he
                            would also bring my <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> immediately to
                            the attention of President Lopez Contreras.</p>

                        <p>128. For the Secretary and Under Secretary. Department’s circular August
                            9, 6 p.m. I today communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d164fn6">Carlos Saavedra Lamas.</note> its pertinent
                            contents. The Minister inquired whether I was merely informing him or
                            whether I desired his comments. I replied that I felt sure you would
                            wish to have the frank expression of his opinion.</p>
                        <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0164"/>
                        <p>The Minister then said that the proposal of our administration as
                            reported in newspaper despatches had caused a deep impression here and
                            that he greatly regretted it, considered it a bad business and
                            prejudicial to our policy in the Americas. He said he had been
                            discussing the matter with the President and that he rather thought that
                            Argentina would have to set up a Council of National Defense if the
                            proposed leasing of destroyers should take effect in the case of Brazil
                            since it would destroy existing naval equilibrium in this
                            hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said further that he had always tried to envisage our
                            problems from our standpoint and had looked to us to carry the banner of
                            high ideals and that this made him doubly regretful over what we
                            proposed to do.</p>
                        <p>I inquired what he thought Brazil could do if we refused such help,
                            assuming as I did that its statement of its fears was sincere, to which
                            he replied that Brazil could look to all of America for her defense
                            against European aggression, citing the case of Uruguay during the World
                            War when assurances were given the Government of that country that all
                            the resources of Argentina would be at its disposal in case of attack by
                            Germany. He remarked in this connection that the financial resources of
                            Argentina just now were very great.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion the Minister said that he would weigh the matter further
                            and would be glad to give me a further expression of his opinion
                            later.</p>

                        <p>46. Department’s rush August 9, 6 p.m. Explained clearly to the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs today the policy of our Government as regards the
                            joint resolution for the leasing of destroyers to the Governments of the
                            American Republics and handed him an informal memorandum embodying the
                            observations given in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Department’s
                            message.</p>
                        <p>The Minister assured me that no misconception as to the impartial spirit
                            of our Government’s attitude in this matter is entertained by his
                            Government but said he believes it would be advisable to furnish the
                            press of Santiago at once with the substance of the sections mentioned
                            as a means of forestalling possible misunderstanding. To this I

                        <p>219. Department’s circular telegram August 9, 6 p.m. I have today
                            communicated to General Hay<note n="7" xml:id="d166fn7">Eduardo Hay,
                                Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> the three points given

                            personally that he could foresee that if West Coast nations of South
                            America availed of the opportunity to secure American destroyers the
                            Japanese and some European nations would sit up and take notice. He
                            wondered whether it would serve as a precedent for the furnishing of
                            European war vessels to the contending factions in Spain.<note n="8"

                            or occult in the Brazilian naval program and in this connection referred
                            to the address delivered by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            Macedo Soares in 1936 on the occasion of the visit to Rio de Janeiro of
                            the Argentine Minister of Marine (see paragraph No. 3 of Embassy’s
                            telegram under reference). He added that as is well known Brazil is
                            rebuilding her fleet and that the loan of the destroyers in question is
                            exclusively for the purpose of training the Brazilian Navy to man the
                            new ships which are to be constructed but which will not be ready for

                                    negotiations with the American Government some months ago with a
                                    view to leasing some war vessels which could serve for training
                                    the personnel of our navy. The renovation of the Brazilian Navy
                                    will take considerable time due to the complexities and delays
                                    in constructions of this nature. In order that the Brazilian
                                    officers may develop their technical knowledge these destroyers
                                    will come from the United States on a lease basis and will
                                    supply the means for the study and handling of war vessels in
                                    accordance with our established naval program. In this manner
                                    the Brazilian officers will receive their training aboard
                                    American destroyers in preparation for the eventual but not
                                    immediate delivery of the ships which form part of the plan for
                                    the renewal of the fleet. These destroyers therefore will merely
                                    serve for the preparation of personnel of future ships and in no
                                    manner can any other purpose be attributed to them. The Minister
                                    for Foreign Affairs further stated on being questioned that he
                                    had absolutely received no complaints from any country with
                                    regard to the leasing of the destroyers”.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called upon his own request and stated that he
                            came on his own initiative and without any instructions from his
                            Government. He proceeded to speak of the proposed loan to Brazil by this
                            Government of certain obsolete torpedo destroyers for training purposes
                            and said that in his judgment such loan would violate Article 22 of the
                            Naval Treaty; that a new and, as he conceived it, dangerous practice of
                            loaning naval war vessels to one government by another would be
                            introduced; that this was calculated to create serious repercussions
                            among certain countries in Europe, especially those signatory to the
                            Naval Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I then proceeded to say to the Ambassador that my letter to the Senate
                            Committee and our statements to the press have rather fully set out the
                            facts of the proposal; that it has been the practice from time to time
                            to permit students of South American governments to <pb n="157"
                                xml:id="pg_157" facs="0167"/>come to this country and receive
                            training on our naval vessels; that we send naval, and military, and
                            many other kinds of experts to South American countries to train and
                            otherwise serve their governments and their peoples; that there is not
                            conceived to be any difference in principle between sending groups of
                            students to this country to be trained in our naval vessels and sending
                            an old vessel, out of commission, to Brazil or other South American
                            countries solely for the training of their students and for no purpose
                            of an objectionable or questionable nature; that other countries will do
                            this identical thing, as did our German friends in the case of Turkey
                            prior to the World War when Turkish commerce was largely taken over and
                            even a secret treaty negotiated. I added that we did not want to see
                            anything like this happen in South America. Finally, I said that, of
                            course, while it is true that the Naval Treaty has been violated in many
                            ways by most countries, we had no disposition ourselves to violate this
                            or any other treaty and that we felt safe in our attitude with respect
                            to its observation; that also we had, of course, planned to acquaint
                            other signatories to the Naval Treaty with the proposal. This was
                            practically the end of the conversation. The Ambassador held out rather
                            definitely his personal opinion that the Treaty would be violated.</p>

                            destroyer matter until the holding of a naval conference. Aranha
                            recommends that, should the American Government agree with the point of
                            view of the Argentine, Brazil should relinquish the project of obtaining
                            the destroyers but should at the same time make it clear that Brazil
                            cannot in any way admit the right of a third power to interfere in this
                            question. The Minister then declared that he would at once telephone
                            Aranha that the President and he agreed with him but he added
                            significantly “we do not believe that the American Government will agree
                            with the stand taken by Argentina”. [Caffery.]</p>

                        <p>222. Department’s circular August 9, 6 p.m. General Hay informs me
                            confidentially that the Argentine Chargé d’Affaires has today approached
                            him under instructions from his Government asking that his good offices
                            be exercised informally to bring about a delay in passage of the joint
                            resolution so that the Argentine Government may have time to work out
                            the problem with our Government. Hay has asked me to inquire of the
                            Department at approximately what date passage of the resolution is
                            expected. He has told the Argentine Chargé d’Affaires of the recapture
                            clause. He asked me whether <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0169"
                            />there would be any objection to his communicating orally to the Chargé
                            d’Affaires the substance of the numbered paragraphs in the Department’s
                            circular of August 9, 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I thought there would be no objection but would
                            appreciate word from the Department by morning of Monday, August 16, if
                            any objection exists so that I can advise him.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Chargé d’Affaires asked General Hay for the Mexican
                            Government’s views on the entire matter. The General told him that he
                            would have to consult with the President and thus postponed reply until

                        <p>95. The Minister for Foreign Affairs called me to his office this
                            afternoon and informed me that according to a telegram from Aranha the
                            American Government has decided to leave the destroyer matter in
                            suspense for the moment pending consultation with other governments. He
                            added that, although Brazil knows that all of the other interested
                            Governments, with the exception of Argentina, are favorable to the
                            Brazilian point of view, the Brazilian Government is making appropriate
                            representations to every Government in Latin America, through its
                            representatives in each capital, with a view of having the various
                            representatives of those Governments in Washington inform the State
                            Department in precise terms of their Governments’ approval of the
                            Brazilian point of view. He explained that the Brazilian Government
                            hopes through [this?] means to isolate Argentina. He added that an
                            examination of the juridical arguments, put forward by Saavedra Lamas,
                            has convinced his Government that those arguments are “worthless”; the
                            Foreign Office is giving a communiqué to the press this evening which he
                            is convinced will completely refute those arguments; this statement will
                            be cabled to all Brazilian representatives in the Latin American
                            capitals. (I am informed press associations are telegraphing full text
                            of the communiqué.)</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs then added that the question of whether
                            Brazil receives the destroyers or not has become of secondary
                            importance, what is of a great deal more importance to Brazil is the
                            impression which would be created in the rest of the world if Argentina
                                <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0170"/>or to put it more exactly
                            one man in Argentina is able to dominate the rest of this continent. The
                            Minister added that he particularly referred to Saavedra Lamas as he
                            does not think that the latter represents the views of Argentina as a
                            whole or of the Argentine Government. He concluded by stating that this
                            whole question has become of “vital importance” to Brazil and that the
                            Brazilian Government sincerely hopes that the United States will carry
                            out what has already been agreed upon with Brazil.</p>

                            found him noncommittal; however, the President suggested and himself
                            arranged by telephone an interview with Saavedra Lamas. The latter was
                            adamant.</p>
                        <p>The Minister referred also to the draft joint statement<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d176fn17">See circular telegram of August 19, 7 p.m., <ref

                            statement and in view of the fact also that there are a number of
                            garbles in the text of the draft he will not be able to have President
                            Vargas consider it this evening; in fact he apprehends that President
                            Vargas may require 3 or 4 days to study it. In any event he hopes that
                            the statement can be published by Saturday.</p>

                        <p>140. Referring to my 137, August 16, 5 p.m.,<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d178fn18">Not printed.</note> the decline in popular
                            interest in the destroyer matter referred to therein appears to
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>Today in an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on an
                            unrelated matter he brought up this subject. His words and manner seemed
                            to me apologetic and as if chosen to leave the impression that he had
                            only acted in the face of pressure brought by the Ministry of Marine. He
                            mentioned that the officer referred to in the fourth paragraph of my 137
                            had been consulted by the editors of <hi rend="italic">La Nación</hi>
                            and had impressed on them the gravity and unfortunate nature of the
                            American proposal; the flat contradiction here evidently will not be
                            overlooked.</p>
                        <p>The Minister spoke at length of his attempts to smooth down and mitigate
                            both official and popular discussion of the matter as serving no good
                            purpose, asserting that through his active intervention he had prevented
                            interpellations in the Senate which had been favored by a Socialist
                            member “whom he greatly feared”. He also spoke of his efforts with the
                            local press to minimize publicity.</p>
                        <p>In emphasizing the local nature of the general leasing question which he
                            thought contained potentialities of continental significance, he
                            mentioned actual or potential reactions in Argentina’s relations with
                            Chile and Brazil and read me lengthy telegrams and letters from his
                            Ambassador in Rio de Janeiro tending to demonstrate that the Brazilian
                            Government had refused to allow his exhaustive press statement to be
                            published; hence Brazilian criticism of his attitude was based on
                            imperfect knowledge.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion he stated and restated his belief that with the passage of
                            time and with the adjournment of the Argentine and American Congresses
                            “a satisfactory solution” of the matter could be worked out.</p>

                                <p>“For many years past several governments of the American
                                    Republics have permitted officers from other American countries
                                    to receive instruction and training in their military or naval
                                    establishments. This form of reciprocal assistance became
                                    generalized long ago, and is today incorporated in the policy of
                                    cooperation between all of the American nations. The policy and
                                    principle involved in the proposal of the Government of the
                                    United States to lease at nominal cost to all other American
                                    nations alike destroyers already out of commission solely for
                                    training purposes are identical. Naturally speculation as to
                                    possible interpretations and abuses that could arise can be
                                    applicable to any law, principle, policy of government, or
                                    international practice.</p>
                                <p>When the United States was first advised by the Government of
                                    Brazil of its desire to secure temporarily certain destroyers of
                                    the United States already out of commission for training
                                    purposes both Governments were in entire accord that in order to
                                    avoid all possible misapprehension the vessels which might be
                                    leased should in no event be employed for combat and should be
                                    returned to the United States if at any time the continued use
                                    of such vessels by Brazil should prove to be in contravention of
                                    the international obligations of either Government. The two
                                    Governments were of the opinion after very full consideration
                                    that the proposal of the United States would be in entire
                                    harmony with its policy, welcomed in many previous instances by
                                    the governments of other American Republics, of lending its
                                    officers to them for instruction purposes or of receiving their
                                    officers for training in the naval vessels of the United States
                                    in American waters. The proposal envisaged, of course, merely
                                    the offer of a neighborly service to such of the other American
                                    nations as might desire it and in this way to promote
                                    understanding, friendliness, and mutually beneficial
                                    relationships between all of the American nations.</p>
                                <p>The Governments of Brazil and of the United States consider that
                                    they have played their full part in supporting the principles of
                                    the good neighbor policy since it was initiated and that they
                                    have shared in its development and in its increasingly
                                    widespread application, and therefore the two Governments feel
                                    all the more concerned for the safeguarding and further
                                    expansion of this relationship between the American Republics.
                                    To that end, while conscious of the absolute soundness of their
                                    position in the proposal above referred to, and of the harmony
                                    of that proposal with the essential features of the good
                                    neighbor policy as universally recognized, they have
                                    nevertheless no disposition to encourage international
                                    controversy relative to some entirely minor and temporary phase
                                    of that policy. At this critical moment in international
                                    relationships in other parts of the world, they consider that
                                    all governments should bend every effort towards the avoidance
                                    of the arousing of any form of dispute and should concentrate
                                    upon the creation of the foundations indispensable to the
                                    existence of world peace. The larger and all-important
                                    objectives of the recent Conference for the Maintenance of Peace
                                    at Buenos Aires should be uppermost in the minds of all of the
                                    American Governments <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0174"
                                    />and statesmen, and they should not permit themselves to be
                                    drawn into discussions about details or proposals of temporary
                                    application, no matter how beneficial they believe them to
                                    be.</p>
                                <p>The Governments of Brazil and of the United States are not
                                    disposed to enter into any controversy with respect to the
                                    pending proposal, nor to modify their understanding with regard
                                    to it, and their only regret is that a question of such limited
                                    importance should even for a few days be allowed to divert
                                    attention from the high ideals and the broad program which the
                                    good neighbor policy comprises.</p>
                                <p>The efforts of the two Governments in behalf of peace among the
                                    Americas and in behalf of world peace should be more than
                                    sufficient to make it clear to all other countries that they
                                    would deprecate the initiation or the pursuance of any policy
                                    which could legitimately be considered by the nations of the
                                    continent as in any way detrimental to the cause of
                                    inter-American friendship and understanding.”</p>

                        <p>145. Department’s circular August 19, 7 p.m. Joint statement is published
                            in full and prominently in the local press as well as the statement of
                            Argentine Ambassador in Brazil setting forth the attitude of his
                            Government. Editorial comment on these two statements may be expected
                            tomorrow.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi> in a very cordial and outspoken editorial
                            last night entitled “Continental harmony has not been disturbed,” states
                            that the attitude of the United States in the destroyer matter cannot be
                            regarded as anything but an impartial demonstration of good will towards
                            the nations of America and is in no way a gesture initiating a new
                            policy to bring about the formation of coalitions among American
                            nations. Neither Brazil nor the United States desires such a state of
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs sent me yesterday a lengthy <hi
                                rend="italic">pro memoria</hi> setting forth the chronology of
                            events here with regard to the destroyer matter which seems a sort of
                            apologia for his previous utterances. Translation by air mail.</p>
                        <p>From this document as well as from my conversation with the Minister and
                            others, I gather that Argentine pique may be largely explained by the
                            fact that this country was not consulted before the <pb n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0175"/>publication of the Walsh Resolution and
                            the adoption of the principle of lending destroyers in the same way as
                            naval officers. Now that this pique has subsided I incline to believe
                            the Minister may probably be beginning to regret his impetuous press
                            statements which, I am told, he now declares were made more as a jurist
                            than as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

                            <p>The Argentine Government learned the news of the proposed lease of
                                destroyers through the telegrams which were published by <hi
                                    rend="italic">La Nación</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La
                                    Prensa</hi> on the 8th instant. If it had been only a matter of
                                a lease to Brazil, no one would have taken the liberty to discuss or
                                consider it. But to the bilateral operation there was added an
                                individual offer made to all the countries, as was done to
                                Argentina. However, in view of its special sentiment with regard to
                                Brazil which was placed only in the position of initiator of a
                                question to which the United States had given a continental
                                character, the Argentine Chancellery wished to abstain from
                                expressing an opinion or from adopting an attitude in spite of the
                                comments of the press which among us is absolutely free from any
                                censorship and control.</p>
                            <p>In Washington on August 12 Mr. Hull stated to press correspondents
                                that “no expression of disapproval of the projected lease of
                                destroyers had been received from Argentina or any other nation”
                                (see telegram from Washington in <hi rend="italic">La Prensa</hi>
                                August 13.)</p>
                            <p>On that same date August 12 Ambassador Espil stated in Washington
                                that he did not even have instructions from his Government, and <pb
                                    n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0176"/>that he was awaiting events
                                in spite of numerous press reports and comment throughout the
                                continent. Neither were instructions sent to Ambassador Cárcano in
                                Rio de Janeiro to take steps to make inquiries which might in any
                                way appear as an observation or protest.</p>
                            <p>The Chancellery was waiting for Brazil to publish information as it
                                deemed suitable. On the 11th instant, the Brazilian Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs, Pímentel Brandao, as reported in newspaper cable
                                reports from Rio de Janeiro, summoned national and foreign press
                                representatives to give them an explanation concerning the lease of
                                destroyers. The Argentine press that same day (see <hi rend="italic"
                                    >La Nación</hi> August 12) stated that the Argentine Government
                                would address a statement to Washington according to information and
                                as a simple project. The newspaper version said textually: “Despite
                                the silence observed as to the decision of the Executive Power, we
                                were informed through reliable sources, that the Chancellery was
                                ready to address a statement to the Department of State at
                                Washington.”</p>
                            <p>At the same time several Argentine legislators requested information
                                from the press, and one of them, Senator José Heriberto Martinez,
                                informed the Government that he was planning an interpellation which
                                was agreed upon at a meeting of senators of various sectors. The
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs requested and obtained the postponement
                                of this interpellation, and this was also done by the President of
                                the Republic who summoned the above-mentioned senator to his office
                                because he wished to wait until the Brazilian and United States
                                foreign offices should make whatever statements they might deem
                                appropriate in view of press comments published throughout the
                                continent.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Government had to consider a Memorandum which had been
                                delivered directly by the Ambassador of the United States in Buenos
                                Aires, informing it of the proposed joint resolution which had been
                                submitted to the United States Senate on August 7 stating “that as
                                could be seen from the text of this pending resolution, the
                                Government of the United States, should the powers requested be
                                granted by the Congress to the President, would make available on
                                equal terms to all of the American Republics possessing naval forces
                                the facilities referred to in this resolution, should they desire to
                                avail themselves of them”; the above-mentioned memorandum also
                                referred to the terms under which the proposed operation would be
                                effected. This memorandum was presented on August 10 and some of the
                                above mentioned legislators were acquainted with it.</p>
                            <p>Under the circumstances, and for the sole purpose of replying to the
                                offer conveyed in the communication from the United States, in
                                considering the question in its continental aspect, the Chancellery
                                sent instructions to the Ambassador at Washington on August 12.</p>
                            <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0177"/>
                            <p>Simultaneously with the postponement of the proposed interpellation
                                which at a secret or public session might have caused a deeper
                                stirring of opinion as already reflected in press comment in the
                                various countries of the continent, and in order to clear the matter
                                in Congress, the Chancellery resolved to summon press
                                correspondents, just as the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                had done on August 11. The object of the summons was not to issue an
                                official communiqué or document, but to give explanations to
                                newspaper representatives in accordance with their insistent
                                request, in view of the requirements of public opinion and of the
                                proposed interpellation, for not a word had so far been uttered by
                                the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as was forthwith pointed out, i.
                                e., that “these were the first statements made by the Argentine
                                Chancellery in order that no one should suppose even for a minute
                                that any feeling had prevailed other than deep friendship and
                                sincerity concerning the Brazilian problem connected with the case.”
                                It was added further, “I consider that one of the achievements of
                                our Government is the <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi>, the
                                better understanding and the sincere and loyal friendship which we
                                have carried to the highest degree ever attained by diplomacy in the
                                relations between Argentina and Brazil.”</p>
                            <p>“The numerous treaties concluded”, the Minister added, “within a
                                short period which in other cases have been obtained after long
                                years and which were negotiated almost simultaneously with the
                                visits of Presidents Justo and Vargas, the firm support which we
                                have given each other in our reciprocal initiatives; the deep rooted
                                custom which has become a social rule, of having periodical visits
                                of prominent men and groups of families, visits, which had never
                                been exchanged as now, all this has contributed to establish between
                                both countries a sentiment of true kinship. These very days when all
                                this comment is circulating, both Chancelleries were preparing the
                                ceremonies during which the two Presidents are shortly to inaugurate
                                the monoliths to be the cornerstone of the international bridge
                                planned some time ago and which will doubtless be a symbolical
                                expression of reciprocal currents of every kind flowing from one
                                country to the other in the future.”</p>
                            <p>To this was added the following statement which was also published in
                                the newspapers: “The fact that Brazil should increase its naval
                                power availing itself of a legitimate right in order to meet an
                                equally legitimate need, cannot but awaken in us the desire to lend
                                our cooperation which, were it useful, we gladly would have offered.
                                In any case we would have wished to rival with the nations which
                                might have anticipated such an offer or lent such cooperation. There
                                has undoubtedly been exaggeration in this respect and even
                                distortion—in <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0178"/>the midst of
                                the confusion which is so easily created—of our point of view
                                concerning the acquisition of destroyers which does not imply an
                                increase of naval power that could cause concern among us, for we
                                would support such an increase with all our will if it were
                                necessary.”</p>
                            <p>What is more, in order to prove his respect for the question insofar
                                as it regards Brazil and to separate it from the necessary
                                consideration of the continental phase of the matter, besides the
                                direct offer received as conveyed in the statement of the United
                                States, the Minister went on to say: “It is therefore well to make
                                this clear. What caused and is causing our concern is the appearance
                                of an unprecedented rule in our American relations which requires
                                thorough consideration of its application to all the American
                                Republics. I refer to the offer to lease warships to the twenty
                                republics, an offer which was doubtless prompted by a noble purpose
                                but which requires special study. Any regional problem must be
                                entirely laid aside in order to concentrate attention solely on the
                                point of interest to us: The pacifist continental phase of our
                                collective relations with regard to this completely new method of
                                developing the naval power of the countries of America, its scope,
                                its consequences and its general application in the future.”</p>
                            <p>Before going on to consider the problem in its continental aspect and
                                from a juridical point of view, the Minister ends this part of his
                                statement, by insisting on definitely waiving all points relative to
                                the agreement between the United States and Brazil, in order to
                                avoid erroneous interpretations. He says therefore: “This public
                                statement which, I repeat, is the first and only one I make on the
                                subject, is intended to explain the views, the sentiment and the
                                concern which prompt the attitude of the Argentine Government.”</p>
                            <p>“Let it then be understood that our Government has duly appreciated
                                the reason given by the Government of the United States and Brazil
                                to justify the projected lease of warships. It does not question the
                                defensive needs mentioned, nor the peaceful training purpose for
                                which the destroyers would be used. Its only point of view consists
                                in permitting itself to consider the disadvantages which might
                                result from the method of leasing warships if it were generally
                                applied as a means of acquiring war material intended to strengthen
                                the power of each country.”</p>
                            <p>As was reported in the newspapers, the legislators abandoned the idea
                                of an interpellation when explanations were given to press
                                correspondents and published in the respective newspapers.</p>
                            <p>On the 14th instant <hi rend="italic">La Nación</hi> stated “Senators
                                Palacios, Martinez and Gonzalez Iramain, who last Thursday had
                                started conversations relative to the lease of a few warships to
                                Brazil by the United States, with the purpose of considering whether
                                or not the Senate should <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0179"
                                />take the initiative in order to know the opinion of the Executive
                                Power on the subject, held another meeting in the red hall of the
                                Senate, and resumed their comments.</p>
                            <p>“The first exchange of impressions indicated that the above-mentioned
                                senators coincided in their favorable appreciation of the statements
                                issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and after this brief
                                exchange of ideas it was tacitly agreed that it is not necessary,
                                for the time being, for the Senate to take any action in this
                                matter.”</p>
                            <p>This resolution was made publicly known by the President of the
                                Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

                            by the United States to Brazil and other Latin American Republics, I
                            have the honor to transmit herewith a copy and translation of an <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>, or statement,<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d182fn23">Not printed.</note> handed to me on the 19th
                            instant, by Señor Benjamin Cohen on behalf of the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs.</p>
                        <p>Señor Cohen stated that the Minister wished to express to me that his
                            Government entertained no objection to the proposed leasing of
                            destroyers and would be glad if I would convey this statement to my
                            Government as a means of clarifying Chile’s position in a matter which
                            had occasioned such widespread comment in South America and as an
                            informal reply to the information communicated by me to him in
                            accordance with the Department’s cabled circular instruction of August
                            9, 6 p.m. The statement has been given to the press of Santiago and
                            appeared today, the 20th instant.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation during his visit, Señor Cohen expressed
                            his personal belief that the proposal to lease destroyers had attained
                            its controversial importance largely as a result of two unforeseen
                            factors: (1) the obstructive attitude assumed by Argentina and (2) the
                            suggestion emanating from the press of the United States to the effect
                            that the proposal might have arisen owing to the existence of some
                            threat to Brazilian sovereignty from non-American sources.</p>
                        <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0180"/>
                        <p>With regard to the former, Cohen said he had heard that the proposal had
                            been mentioned to the Argentine Government by the Brazilian Ambassador
                            in Buenos Aires some time prior to its having been given publicity, and
                            that the Brazilian representative had been given to understand then that
                            it would not be viewed with disfavor in that quarter. He said also that
                            it would appear that the Brazilian Government, which is now obtaining
                            expressions of opinion regarding the proposal from the various Latin
                            American States, is determined to bring the legality and the feasibility
                            of the proposal to a successful issue.</p>
                        <p>I mention these remarks by an official of the Foreign Office to the
                            Department as of casual interest only.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, the attitude of the Chilean press remains as
                            previously reported—the governmental organs mildly favorable, <hi
                                rend="italic">El Imparcial</hi> and papers of the opposition very
                            critical in their comments on the Joint Resolution.</p>
                        <p>With reference to my cable message No. 50 of August 18, 11 a.m.,
                            reporting a conversation with the Brazilian Ambassador, I beg to report
                            that there is published in the Santiago press of today, the 20th
                            instant, a statement handed to the Foreign Minister by the Brazilian
                            Ambassador here. This statement was released by the Brazilian Government
                            to the press of Bio de Janeiro on the 15th instant and doubtless is
                            already known to the Department.</p>
                        <p>There has appeared also in the Santiago press this morning the joint
                            statement by the Governments of the United States and Brazil which forms
                            the subject of the Department’s telegraphic circular of August 19, 7
                            p.m.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that this frank announcement will not occasion a fresh
                            outbreak of editorial fireworks so dear to the Latin American heart.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Ambassador has told me over the telephone that he has read
                            the statement with very great pleasure. Other press news from the United
                            States indicates that the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval
                            Affairs has expressed the opinion that there is small probability of the
                            proposal for the leasing of destroyers being approved by that body.</p>
                        <p>As of probable interest to the Department, I beg to transmit with this
                            copies and translations of editorials on the question of the leasing of
                            destroyers from <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> of the 17th instant,
                                <hi rend="italic">La Nación</hi> of the 18th instant, <hi

                                <p>“The Government of Ecuador considers the said proposed

                                    be made, as a practical application of the good neighbor policy.
                                    It believes that because of the purposes for which the vessels
                                    would be used the proposal signifies a desire that all of the
                                    American countries on equal terms can train efficient personnel
                                    to serve in their navies without this signifying a threat to
                                    anyone because it would be an offer which would be made to all
                                    on equal terms and because the conditions of returning the

                                    prove the eagerness to maintain absolute neutrality.</p>
                                <p>In case that the proposal is approved Ecuador would be interested
                                    in leasing one or two vessels provided that the financial terms
                                    are satisfactory.”</p>

                        <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom desire to place on record
                            the following views with regard to the recent proposal for the leasing
                            to Latin-American Republics of destroyers not at present in use by the
                            United States Navy.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government consider that if loans of vessels had been
                            regarded as practical politics when Article XVIII of the Washington
                                Treaty<note n="24" xml:id="d185fn24">Treaty between the United

                                signed at Washington, February 6, 1922, <ref

                            was framed, provisions to cover that contingency would certainly have
                            been inserted. Thus the loaning of ships appears to His Majesty’s
                            Government to constitute a violation of the spirit of Article 22 of the
                            1936 London Naval Treaty, which reproduces in substance the text of
                            Article XVIII of the Washington Treaty.</p>
                        <p>As regards the destroyers which it is proposed to loan in the present
                            instance, it is felt that even though they were to be used for training
                            purposes and would not be employed as fighting ships, they would still
                            be bound to retain their fighting qualities and potentialities, which a
                            vessel intended for training purposes does not and never can possess,
                            and must therefore, contrary to the provisions of Article 22, become a
                            service vessel of war in a foreign navy. It would be hard to maintain
                            that the destroyers would be completely converted into training ships,
                            and thus lose all their fighting value, if they were only on loan and
                            after a certain period of time had to be returned to the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Apart from these considerations, His Majesty’s Government view with much
                            apprehension the serious consequences which might result for all
                            concerned in the event of such a practice becoming at all general. The
                            whole balance of naval power might be upset and it might become
                            impossible to calculate the effective strength of the fleet of any given
                            country. It was precisely such a sudden alteration of naval strength
                            that the provisions in question were intended to avert.</p>

                            and said that whereas the British Government appreciated that no further

                            to Brazil for training purposes at any rate until after Congress had
                            reconvened, nonetheless it felt that it must make, as a matter of

                            referring to the United Press despatch dated October 20 alleging that a
                            contract leasing six United States destroyers to Brazil had been signed
                            in Washington by the Brazilian Ambassador and by Mr. Sumner Welles, the

                                1937, has received careful consideration and the Government of the
                                United States will be able to cooperate on the work, in the manner
                                suggested by the Nicaraguan Government.</p>
                            <p>Engineers of the Bureau of Public Roads of the Department of
                                Agriculture of my Government have been instructed to proceed at once
                                with the detailed surveys and plans for the three bridges specified
                                by you and the final location of the section of road in the

                                requested.</p>
                            <p>In communicating to Your Excellency my Government’s willingness to
                                cooperate on the work in the manner specified by your Government, in
                                order to make certain that there shall be no misunderstanding, I am
                                asked to add the following explanations:</p>
                            <p>The three bridges now to be built are substituted for the Ochomogo
                                bridge formerly offered, (the offer of which is hereby withdrawn);
                                but the conditions specified to govern the cooperation of the two
                                Governments in the construction of that bridge will, it is
                                understood, govern in the construction of these three. The technical
                                representatives of the Bureau of Public Roads of my Government will
                                complete, insofar as they have not already done so, the location
                                surveys along the proposed section of the Highway and furnish
                                preliminary estimates of costs of the construction work for the use
                                of the interested Nicaraguan authorities. The Government of the
                                United States can furnish for the road construction specified such
                                road-building equipment as is considered necessary for the work,
                                with the understanding that such equipment will not be used on any
                                roads not on the route of the Inter-American Highway. In addition to
                                this road-building equipment, the United States Government can
                                furnish such steel beams, reenforcing metals and culvert pipes as
                                may be required for the drainage structures along the specified
                                section of the Highway and the bitumen needed to bind the surface.
                                It is understood that, as stated in one of your notes of January 9,
                                1937, referred to above, the Nicaraguan Government will furnish the
                                needed construction materials which can be obtained in Nicaragua for
                                both the bridge construction and road construction and also the
                                labor and money necessary to complete the construction work. It is
                                also understood by my Government that the Nicaraguan Government will
                                pay the costs of transporting to the various locations where they
                                will be used not only the materials needed which can be obtained in
                                Nicaragua but also (from the Nicaraguan ports where they shall be
                                landed) the road-building equipment and materials furnished by my
                                Government, including their passage over wharves or through customs
                                houses, no customs charges to be assessed against my Government on
                                any such equipment or materials. It is further understood that
                                Nicaragua will furnish all rights of way needed and in connection
                                with all transportation and construction, <pb n="178"
                                    xml:id="pg_178" facs="0188"/>provide easements sufficient for
                                needed operations, and will hold the United States harmless under
                                local law for all employees liability obligations.</p>
                            <p>The necessary steps will be taken by my Government to assign an
                                engineer, in accordance with the request contained in one of Your
                                Excellency’s notes, referred to above, to supervise the road
                                construction work on the specified section of the Highway,
                                especially the placement of the materials supplied by my Government.
                                The Nicaraguan Government should assign as an assistant a local
                                engineer to collaborate with him; but the details of this assignment
                                and collaboration should be fixed only after discussions between
                                local technical representatives of the Bureau of Public Roads of my
                                Government and the appropriate Nicaraguan authorities.</p>

                                Excellency that the cooperation in road construction along the route
                                of the Inter-American Highway between Cartago and San Marcos
                                tentatively proposed in your Government’s note of September 10,
                                1936, has received careful consideration and that the Government of
                                the United States will be able to cooperate on the work in the
                                manner suggested by the Government of Costa Rica.</p>
                            <p>In communicating to Your Excellency my Government’s willingness to
                                cooperate in the manner specified by your Government, in order to
                                make certain that there shall be no misunderstanding, I am
                                instructed to add the following explanations:</p>
                            <p>The technical representatives in Costa Rica of the Bureau of Public
                                Roads of my Government will complete, insofar as they have not
                                already done so, the location surveys along the proposed section of
                                the Highway and furnish preliminary estimates of costs of the
                                construction work for the use of the interested Costa Rican
                                authorities. My Government can furnish such road-building equipment
                                as will be needed for use in the construction of the specified
                                section of the road in question, with the understanding that such
                                equipment will not be used on any roads not on the route of the
                                Inter-American Highway. In addition to such equipment the United
                                States Government can furnish such steel beams, reenforcing metals,
                                and culvert pipes, as may be required for the drainage structures
                                along the specified section of the Highway. If the Government of
                                Costa Rica is prepared to undertake the financing of a type of
                                construction on this proposed work similar to that already
                                undertaken by it elsewhere in the vicinity of Cartago and San José,
                                my Government will be able not only to supply the additional
                                equipment required for bituminous or concrete construction, but also
                                the bituminous materials and cement, so far as these are products of
                                the United States and so far as available funds will permit. My
                                Government will also assign an engineer to supervise the placement
                                of all construction materials which it supplies. It is understood
                                that, as stated in your note of September 10, 1936, referred to
                                above, the Costa Rican Government will furnish the needed
                                construction materials which can be obtained in your country and
                                also the labor and money deemed necessary to complete the proposed
                                construction work. It is also understood by my Government that the
                                Costa Rican Government will pay the costs of transporting to the
                                various locations where they will be used not only the materials
                                needed which can be obtained in Costa Rica but also (from the Costa
                                Rican ports where they shall be landed) the road-building equipment
                                and <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0190"/>materials furnished by
                                my Government, including their passage over wharves or through
                                customs houses, no customs charges to be assessed against my
                                Government on any such equipment or materials. It is further
                                understood that Costa Rica will furnish all rights of way needed and
                                in connection with all transportation and construction, provide
                                easements sufficient for needed operations, and will hold the United
                                States harmless under local law for all employees liability
                                obligations.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the indication in Your Excellency’s note of September
                                10, 1936, that, upon the approval of the work now proposed by Costa
                                Rica, the Executive would submit the matter to the Constitutional
                                Congress for its ratification and its authorization of the necessary
                                expenditures, I am asked to state that as soon as my Government
                                shall be informed that the Costa Rican Government has definitively
                                announced that it desires to proceed with the proposed road
                                construction along the lines indicated, my Government will be ready
                                to begin at once its part of the work.</p>
                            <p>Accept [etc.]</p>

                                that I have been directed to make the following explanations
                                regarding further cooperative construction work along the route of
                                the Inter American Highway through your country:</p>
                            <p>It is understood that when Mr. E. W. James of the Bureau of Public
                                Roads of my Government was in Guatemala some months ago to discuss
                                with the appropriate authorities of your Government plans for
                                further cooperative construction work along the route of the
                                projected Highway, he was informed that, instead of the construction
                                of a bridge over the Panajachel River, in the construction of which
                                he was prepared to say that he believed his Government would be able
                                to cooperate, as in the construction of the Tamazulapa bridge, the
                                interested officials of your Government indicated that they would
                                prefer to have the cooperation of my Government in the construction
                                of two small bridges and in supplying culvert pipe and other culvert
                                materials needed along approximately twenty-four kilometers of the
                                route of the Highway between Asunción Mita and the frontier of El
                                Salvador. It is also understood that this section of the projected
                                Highway has already been re-located by engineers of the Bureau of
                                Public Roads of my Government, that the new location has been
                                accepted by the highway organization of your Government, and that
                                the latter has recently indicated, informally, a desire that my
                                Government furnish certain road-building equipment for use in the
                                construction work specified.</p>
                            <p>I am instructed to inform Your Excellency that careful consideration
                                has been given to the matter by the appropriate officials of my
                                Government and that the procedure suggested by the Guatemalan
                                authorities is acceptable to my Government.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, I have been directed to state that my Government is
                                prepared to cooperate in the designated construction work by
                                supplying the necessary materials for, and erecting, under the
                                conditions that have governed in the cooperative construction of the
                                Tamazulapa bridge, the two specified small bridges along the
                                designated section of the Inter American Highway. It is also
                                understood that no customs of El Salvador, by supplying and
                                delivering the culvert pipe and other culvert materials needed along
                                the same section of the Highway, and by furnishing and delivering
                                the necessary road-building equipment <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182"
                                    facs="0192"/>for use in the construction work specified, with
                                the understanding that such equipment will not be used on any roads
                                not on the route of the Inter American Highway. It is also
                                understood that no customs charges shall be assessed against my
                                Government upon the entry into Guatemala of any of the specified
                                bridge or culvert materials or road-building equipment, that there
                                shall be no charges for passing these articles over wharves owned by
                                the Guatemalan Government or for transporting them on Government
                                owned vessels or railways, and that when on privately owned
                                railways, vessels or wharves only such charges shall be paid on such
                                articles as are paid on articles owned by the Guatemalan Government.
                                It is further understood that in the cooperative construction work
                                along the specified section of the Highway and in the transportation
                                of the articles supplied by my Government, Guatemala will furnish
                                all necessary rights of way, provide easements sufficient for needed
                                operations, and hold the United States harmless under local law for
                                all employees liability obligations.</p>
                            <p>If the proposal outlined immediately above is acceptable to your
                                Government, I would appreciate having you address to me a note in
                                reply stating that fact. On receipt of your reply I shall be pleased
                                to forward a copy of it to the Department of State of my Government.
                                As soon as your statement that the proposal is acceptable to your
                                Government shall have reached the Department of State, the necessary
                                steps will be taken to carry out my Government’s part of the
                                proposed construction work.</p>

                                projected Inter American Highway through your country:</p>
                            <p>It is understood that when Mr. E. W. James of the Bureau of Public
                                Roads of my Government was in Panama some months ago to discuss with
                                the appropriate authorities of your Government further cooperative
                                bridge construction, he indicated that he believed his Government
                                would be able to cooperate with yours in the construction of one
                                additional bridge, that over the Platenar River, on the conditions
                                which have governed in the cooperative construction of the Chiriquí
                                Bridge. It is also understood that the interested officials of Your
                                Excellency’s Government, on the occasion of a subsequent visit of
                                Mr. James, expressed a desire to change the conditions of
                                cooperation so that three bridges desired by them, namely, those
                                over the Platenar, the Chirigagua, and the San Cristobal Rivers,
                                could be erected and that they consequently proposed that my
                                Government furnish only the structural and reinforcing steel needed
                                for the three bridges and that their Government assume
                                responsibility for all transportation from shipside to the bridge
                                sites, for furnishing all needed cement, for the construction of the
                                substructures, and for the erection of the superstructures of the
                                specified three bridges.</p>
                            <p>I am instructed to inform Your Excellency that careful consideration
                                has been given to the matter by the appropriate officials of my
                                Government and that the alternate proposal referred to above is
                                acceptable to my Government.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, I have been directed to state that my Government is
                                prepared to cooperate in the construction of the three bridges over
                                the Platenar, the Chirigagua, and the San Cristobal Rivers, in the
                                manner specified by the Panamanian authorities. That is, my
                                Government will furnish the steel needed for the three bridges, and
                                the Government of Panama will assume responsibility for all
                                transportation from shipside to the bridge sites, for furnishing all
                                needed <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0194"/>cement, for the
                                construction of the substructures, and for the erection of the
                                superstructures of the specified three bridges. It is understood
                                further that no customs charges shall be levied on any of the
                                materials supplied by my Government and that the conditions under
                                which my Government agreed to cooperate in the construction of the
                                Chiriquí Bridge shall govern in the construction of the three
                                bridges specified above; except insofar as they are modified by the
                                present proposal.</p>
                            <p>If the proposal outlined immediately above is acceptable to your
                                Government, I would appreciate having you address to me a note in
                                reply stating that fact. On receipt of your reply I shall be pleased
                                to forward a copy of it to the Department of State of my Government.
                                As soon as your statement that the proposal is acceptable to your
                                Government shall have reached the Department of State, the necessary
                                steps will be taken to carry out my Government’s part of the
                                proposed construction work.</p>

                                >Dated April 24, not printed.</note> a translated copy of which is
                            herewith transmitted, from which it appears that the Government of
                            Guatemala accepts with pleasure the offer of the <pb n="186"
                                xml:id="pg_186" facs="0196"/>United States to participate in
                            advancing the construction of the Inter American Highway. It will be
                            noted that Minister Salazar does not directly refer to the stipulations
                            of the Department’s memorandum, forwarded with the instruction referred
                            to above, and which were duly transmitted to the Foreign Office in a
                            formal note dated March 2, 1937. The Legation assumes, however, that his
                            present acceptance of the offer, and the fact that certain materials
                            have already been ordered under it from the United States, implies the
                            desire and intention of his Government of complying with the
                            stipulations of the Department in the matter.</p>

                        <p>Mr. James of the Bureau of Public Roads called at my request. I asked him
                            regarding reported plans that Mr. MacDonald<note n="16"
                                xml:id="d197fn16">Thomas H. MacDonald, Chief of the Bureau of Public
                                Roads, Department of Agriculture.</note> has for obtaining
                            additional funds from Congress for assistance in the construction of the
                            Inter-American Highway.</p>
                        <p>Mr. James said that he had recently prepared a report for Mr. MacDonald
                            on the progress already made, and that the report embodied the
                            suggestion that further assistance be given.</p>
                        <p>It is apparently in Mr. MacDonald’s mind to seek an additional
                            appropriation of $1,000,000, and he apparently plans to discuss the
                            matter directly with the White House.</p>
                        <p>I suggested to Mr. James the advisability of consultation with this
                            Department and some agreement between the two Departments before any
                            formal request for funds is initiated. I expressed the personal opinion
                            that a request for an additional million dollars would probably have the
                            approval of this Department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MacDonald apparently has always been the moving spirit in obtaining
                            funds for the Highway, and his interest and enthusiasm are, of course,
                            commendable. From the point of view of correct procedure, however, I
                            believe that he should take what steps he proposes to take in full
                            agreement with this Department.</p>
                        <p>The additional $1,000,000 would be devoted to additional assistance in
                            the form of bridge and highway construction in Central America.</p>

                        <p>I am afraid that I am not at all in accord with the opinion which Mr.
                            Beaulac expressed to Mr. James.<note n="17" xml:id="d198fn17">See
                                memorandum by Mr. Beaulac, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi></note> I do
                            not believe that public opinion in this country nor the Congress would
                            sanction any recommendation by the Department of State for an additional
                            appropriation of one million dollars by the United States as a further
                            contribution towards the construction of the Inter-American Highway. I
                            think any such recommendation would be bad policy.</p>
                        <p>The Central American republics, with the possible exception of Nicaragua,
                            are now fortunately enjoying a period of increasing prosperity. I think
                            it can logically be expected that if they are interested in the
                            construction of the Inter-American Highway, they should use their own
                            funds for the construction of the portion coming within their
                            boundaries. Furthermore, as you will recall, the Inter-American Highway
                            Convention signed recently at Buenos Aires<note n="18" xml:id="d198fn18"
                                >Convention between the United States and other American Republics,
                                signed December 23, 1936, Department of State Treaty Series No. 927,
                                or 51 Stat. 152.</note> provides for the creation of a special
                            commission to recommend to all of the governments interested the ways
                            and means of financing and of constructing the road. Pending the
                            ratification of the Convention and the formulation of the
                            recommendations of the special commission, I would strongly oppose any
                            further appropriation by this Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The program of projects
                            undertaken between this Government and the Central American Governments
                            for the improvement of the Inter-American Highway has now advanced to
                            the point of completion that makes it necessary to decide upon the
                            immediate future operations.</p>
                        <p>There are fourteen of these projects. Eleven provide for the building of
                            bridges in the five countries and these will be completed in September
                            and October. The other three are road projects in Nicaragua, Costa Rica
                            and Guatemala. It is expected that the road projects will continue for
                            two or three months longer. These are in the nature of demonstration
                            examples of road construction designed to organize into efficient road
                            building units the native workmen, using road building equipment from
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The $1,000,000 made available to the President in the Emergency
                            Appropriation Act, fiscal year 1935, for cooperation with several
                            Governments in the improvement of the Inter-American Highway, has been
                            exhausted by the obligations and actual expenditures for the approved
                            program so that no new major projects can be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>The reconnaissance survey began in 1930. The organization of engineers
                            maintained by the Bureau of Public Roads, representing the United
                            States, and the Highway Departments of the Central American countries,
                            have been working in cooperation since then, first on the surveys, and
                            now on actual improvement projects. Through these years, all the
                            cooperative operations have been characterized by harmony and good
                            will.</p>
                        <p>We have requests from several of the Governments to add important
                            projects to the programs which must be denied unless we have additional
                            funds.</p>
                        <p>I feel it is essential that we do not lose, by failure now to provide
                            additional funds in a very moderate amount, the momentum of interest and
                            real action that has taken seven years to build. The balance of funds
                            available will not permit the maintenance of the engineering
                            organization and the central engineering office at San José for more
                            than a few months longer. It is necessary, therefore, that we either
                            have additional funds now or the assurance from the President of his
                            desire to continue the work and to recommend further financial support.
                            I am therefore requesting that you join with me in submitting
                            recommendations to the President as provided in the attached proposed
                            communication.</p>
                        <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0200"/>

                            the Costa Rican inquiry of July 9, modified only the offer to supply
                            bituminous materials and cement and the additional equipment needed for
                            applying the hard-surfacing materials, provided Costa Rica desired to

                            commitment was unconditional and that your Government is prepared to
                            expend the amount necessary to fulfill its unconditional commitment.</p>

                        <p>For your information, and for use at your discretion, in no case has your
                            Government announced to any other the specific sum of money which it was
                            prepared to spend in the proffered cooperation on the Inter-American
                            Highway in that country. Your Government has, on the other hand, offered
                            to perform certain specified work in each country which has accepted its
                            proffered cooperation; and has been prepared to carry that work to

                            special session of the Costa Rican Congress, whether its offer is going
                            to be accepted, so that if the Costa Rican Government should not desire
                            to avail itself of your Government’s proffered cooperation, the funds
                            hitherto reserved for work in Costa Rica can be used in additional work
                            which is desired by governments that have already been cooperating with

                            No. 40 of October 15, 1937,<note n="27" xml:id="d204fn27">Not
                                printed.</note> and to report as follows:</p>
                        <p>On October 27 I called upon Mr. Ricardo Pacheco Lara, Minister of Public
                            Works, for the purpose of presenting Mr. Horatio T. Mooers, Second
                            Secretary of the Legation. During the course of the conversation the
                            Minister brought up the subject of the construction of the San
                            Carlos–Alajuela highway. He reminded me of the recent action of the
                            Costa Rican Congress in authorizing negotiations with either the
                            Legation or officials of the Inter-American Highway as to possible
                            participation of the United States in the construction of an additional
                            twenty kilometers of the San Carlos-Alajuela road. He then requested my
                            personal opinion as to the best method of approach. He was advised that
                            if the Costa Rican Government desired the cooperation of the United
                            States in the construction of the San Carlos section that it might
                            perhaps be well to ask the Foreign Office to advise the Legation and
                            that in such event I should of course be only too glad to communicate
                            the views of the former to the Department of State. I added that I could
                            see no objection, however, to informal conferences with the officials of
                            the Inter-American Highway.</p>
                        <p>The delay of the Foreign Office in acting upon the resolution of Congress
                            pertaining to a bid for American participation in the construction of
                            the San Carlos–Alajuela highway is in no sense of the word due to lack
                            of interest in the construction of this project. National pride has made
                            it rather embarrassing for the Foreign Office to ask for further favors
                            in view of its long delay in acting favorably upon our original
                            proposals. It may be reasonably expected, however, that within the next
                            week or two the Costa Rican Government will formally request American
                            participation in the above-mentioned project.</p>
                        <p>In as much as the proposed construction will require only a very limited
                            outlay of cash and American road building machinery will be available
                            after the completion of the Cartago-San Marcos highway, <pb n="193"
                                xml:id="pg_193" facs="0203"/>I recommend that as a gesture of
                            goodwill the requests of the Foreign Office be anticipated and that we
                            voluntarily offer to participate in this project.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to the Minister of Public Works when the matter was
                            presented that the original appropriation for American participation in
                            highway construction in Central America had been nearly exhausted and I
                            was not at all certain that funds would be available for the San
                            Carlos–Alajuela project. However, the local press during the past week
                            contained an article to the general effect that only seven hundred
                            thousand dollars of the one million dollar appropriation for
                            participation in the Inter-American Highway construction had been
                            expended. Therefore it may reasonably be anticipated that our failure to
                            cooperate in the twenty kilometer project will be made the subject of
                            unfavorable press comment and may adversely affect our prestige in Costa
                            Rica. At the present moment our position is so strong in this country
                            that I regard it as unwise to court criticism in the press, but the
                            questions of whether or not we should extend further aid to Costa Rica
                            or await formal representation from the Foreign Office before agreeing
                            to participation in the San Carlos–Alajuela project is, of course, a
                            matter for the Department to decide.</p>

                        <p>Under date of November 6 the Legation received a note from the Foreign

                            requested in the construction of twenty kilometers of the Inter-American
                            Highway between Naranjo and San Carlos. The note is self-explanatory and

                            that if an appropriation is still available, an early acceptance would
                            be most desirable from the standpoint of promoting and maintaining
                            American prestige in Costa Rica.</p>

                            stating that the Costa Rican Congress had “approved the bill providing

                            forwarded to the Bureau of Public Roads for its information. Copies of

                        <p>It is noted that you were informed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of
                            Costa Rica that his Government accepts without reservation the proposals
                            for participation in the construction of the section of the
                            Inter-American Highway contemplated in your note no. 6 of September 16,
                            that the proposal would immediately be sent to Congress, and that he
                            would inform you of the disposition of the constitutional Congress of
                            the Republic toward the bill as soon as it should be expressed.</p>
                        <p>No subsequent despatch which has reached the Department has stated that
                            this promised formal communication on the subject had been received by
                            you. The note which the Chargé d’Affaires was directed, in the
                            Department’s instruction no. 387 of February 19, 1937, to address to the
                            Costa Rican Government, stated in conclusion that “as soon as my
                            Government shall be informed that the Costa Rican Government has
                            definitively announced that it desires to proceed with the proposed road
                            construction along the lines indicated, my Government will be ready to
                            begin at once its part of the work.”</p>
                        <p>If on receipt of this instruction you shall not already have received and
                            forwarded to the Department the formal communication on the subject,
                            promised by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, you are requested to inform
                            the Department by telegraph whether the statements contained in your
                            despatches referred to above should be accepted by this Government as
                            the definitive announcement of the Costa Rican Government “that it
                            desires to proceed with the proposed road construction along the lines
                            indicated,” the receipt of which announcement was to be the occasion for
                            this Government “to begin at once its part of the work.”</p>
                        <p>It is the understanding of the Department of State that the Bureau of
                            Public Roads is in fact ready to begin this Government’s cooperation in
                            the proposed construction work; but your definite assurance is desired
                            whether any further pertinent communication from the <pb n="195"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Yesterday Mr. Thomas H.
                            MacDonald, Chief of the Bureau of Public Roads, came to see Assistant
                            Secretary Messersmith and left with him a letter addressed to you by Mr.
                            MacDonald dated November 30, 1937,<note n="30" xml:id="d207fn30">Not
                                printed.</note> making a recommendation with regard to the further
                            expenditure of funds in connection with the construction of the
                            Inter-American Highway. The last sentence of that letter refers to the
                            communication which you sent me on August 14 of this year in which my
                            agreement was requested with regard to a recommendation to be submitted
                            to the President that Congress be requested to appropriate one million
                            dollars for further construction work on the highway.</p>
                        <p>As I was glad to state to you over the telephone, I am in accord with
                            your proposal to approach the President with a view to obtaining his
                            agreement to request of Congress an appropriation of five hundred
                            thousand dollars. You may inform the President that I shall be glad to
                            give him an expression of my views in the premises whenever he desires.
                            As in the case of the appropriation of one million dollars authorized in
                            1934, it seems desirable that the expenditure of the funds should be
                            under the general administration of the President, acting with the
                            cooperation of the two Departments as at present. The language of the
                            authorizing legislation might well follow the language of the Act of
                            June, 1934 (Public, No. 412, 73rd Congress).<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d207fn31">48 Stat. 1021, 1042.</note> I should like to add
                            that I believe the Financial Committee provided for in Article 3 of the
                            Convention on the Pan American Highway signed at the Buenos Aires
                            Conference should be formed as soon as the necessary number of countries
                            have ratified, and that this Committee should render its report at the
                            earliest practicable moment in order that the further financing of

                        <p>I approve action to obtain the authority of Congress to use $34,000 of
                            the already appropriated administrative funds of the Bureau <pb n="196"
                                xml:id="pg_196" facs="0206"/>of Public Roads for the maintenance of
                            the engineering organization during the period January to June,
                            1938.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that the enclosure showing the suggested
                            distribution of funds is not a final decision with regard to allocation
                            but merely indicates what Mr. MacDonald considers a desirable program.
                            It will be necessary, of course, to know which countries will cooperate
                            and precisely what their own desires are before a definite distribution
                            can be determined.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I am glad to receive in
                            your letter of December 2 (RA) assurance that you are in accord with my
                            proposal to approach the President with a view to obtaining his
                            agreement to request of Congress a further appropriation of $500,000 for
                            construction operations on the inter-American Highway. In line with your
                            communication, I propose to take this matter up with the President and
                            suggest that he seek also an expression of your views.</p>
                        <p>I am in entire agreement with you regarding the form which an additional
                            appropriation should take, following the language of the Act of June,
                            1934 (Public No. 412, 73d Congress).</p>
                        <p>With respect to securing authorization to use already appropriated
                            administrative funds, amounting to $34,000, for continuing the
                            engineering organization during the balance of the present fiscal year,
                            I am of the opinion that this authorization should be arranged for
                            without necessary reference to a favorable decision regarding a further
                            appropriation for construction. It is important in any case that the
                            engineering organization be retained, for reasons already explained in
                            previous communication to you on this general subject.</p>
                        <p>Your understanding with regard to the specific projects included in the
                            estimate attached to Mr. MacDonald’s letter is correct. However, I
                            understand that projects were selected in which the several countries
                            have already expressed an interest.</p>

                                <p>“Never before have the need and benefit of neighborly cooperation
                                    in every form of human activity been so evident as they are
                                    today. Friendship among nations calls for constructive efforts
                                    to muster the forces of humanity in order that an atmosphere of
                                    close understanding and cooperation may be cultivated. You will
                                    endeavor to be guided by the policy enunciated by President
                                    Roosevelt in his inaugural address: ‘The policy of the good
                                    neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and,
                                    because he does so, respects the rights of others—the neighbor
                                    who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his
                                    agreements in and with a world of neighbors.’ You will keep in
                                    mind the conviction that the well-being of one nation depends in
                                    large measure upon the well-being of its neighbors.</p>
                                <p>“It is an established principle of our international policy that:
                                    ‘Among the foreign relations of the United States as they fall
                                    into categories, the Pan American policy takes first place in
                                    our diplomacy.’ The policy of the Government of the United
                                    States towards the Republics of Latin America is one of mutual
                                    beneficial cooperation and it is of paramount importance that
                                    the spirit of this policy be manifested in your attitude and
                                    action at the Conference.</p>
                                <p>“The coming together of men typical of the best feeling and
                                    thought of all the Republics of the Western Hemisphere can be an
                                    important factor in the promotion of friendly international
                                    relations. Pan-Americanism has been founded upon the common
                                    ideals and a community of interests among the American Republics
                                    and it is with this in view that I desire you to give your
                                    studious attention not only to the particular subjects before
                                    the Conference, but also to the task of becoming imbued with the
                                    spirit which animates the inter-American policy of the United
                                    States.</p>

                                <p>“Our country has occupied a unique position with regard to the
                                    nations of Latin America. Our national individuality and
                                    independence were acquired before theirs, and when they achieved
                                    independence they turned to us for moral guidance and support.
                                    But today, and for many years past, they have stood alone, free,
                                    independent and self-reliant. The United States does not desire,
                                    and in no sense can it be contemplated, that any of the American
                                    peoples should be in a state of tutelage. The independence of
                                    each Republic must recognize the independence of every other. We
                                    wish the fullest possible development in the national lire of
                                    the Republics of America in complete accord with their own
                                    national characteristics and aptitudes. Each nation must grow by
                                    an advancement of civilization and social well-being, and not by
                                    the acquisition of territory at the expense of any neighbor or
                                    by forcing the will of one nation upon that of another. If it is
                                    possible for us to assist them in any way through our
                                    development and our achievements in science and industry, we
                                    shall be glad to extend such assistance in the most friendly
                                    manner, but we shall not proffer it unless it is desired.</p>
                                <p>“You should endeavor, therefore, to impress upon the
                                    representatives of the other American Republics that we desire,
                                    above all, their material prosperity and their political
                                    security and that we entertain only friendly sentiments for
                                    them. You will endeavor to foster a spirit of generous
                                    cooperation and manifest a sincere interest in their respective
                                    efforts and aspirations. It would not seem opportune for the
                                    delegates of the United States to assume a role of leadership in
                                    the Conference, either in its official organization or in its
                                    discussions. Your attitude should be to favor a friendly
                                    expression of views by the delegates of the various countries
                                    and, with due regard to the specific instructions which appear
                                    hereinafter, to support only those proposals which would appear
                                    to be of common interest and which merit the unanimous approval
                                    of the American Republics.”</p>

                        <p>It is felt that this technical conference may be productive of most
                            effective results if its discussions can be limited to noncontroversial
                            questions. Furthermore, any academic discussions of highly controversial
                            questions would tend to create an atmosphere not entirely harmonious. It
                            is the opinion of this Government that much more substantial progress of
                            an enduring nature can be made if the discussions can in fact be
                            restricted to subjects of vital and immediate importance and of general
                            interest.</p>

                        <p>You should bear in mind that this conference has been called to consider
                            aviation matters and therefore you should refrain from any discussion
                            whatsoever of any question of a political nature. You will endeavor to
                            have the conference restrict its activities to those subjects already on
                            the agenda and should any attempt be made to consider a political
                            controversy or problem you will explain that you have no authority to
                            consider such questions. You should point out that this <pb n="202"
                                xml:id="pg_202" facs="0212"/>conference was called specifically to

                            other problems would be inappropriate and inadvisable.</p>
                        <p>The members of the delegation of the United States should in the
                            deliberations of the conference be animated always by a spirit of

                            in mind, however, the views of the Government of the United States as to
                            the action that should be taken by the conference.</p>
                        <p>The members of the delegation will be furnished with data on the various
                            subjects to be considered at the conference.</p>
                        <p>In connection with new proposals submitted for consideration, the
                            delegation should always consider whether the adoption of such proposals
                            would adversely affect aviation interests of the United States in the
                            American Republics, or would tend to further the development thereof or
                            to make possible the establishment of new interests which might be of
                            advantage to the United States.</p>
                        <p>There is no indication in the agenda of the conference of any intention
                            to draft international conventions on the various subjects to be
                            considered at Lima, and it does not appear that there will be sufficient
                            time for an adequate study and analysis of the various questions to
                            warrant the drafting of conventions. However, the members of the
                            delegation of the United States are being furnished full powers to sign
                            conventions, for use in the event that the conference should decide to
                            draft one or more conventions and the delegation should feel that it
                            would be in the interest of the United States to sign them. The
                            delegates are not, however, authorized to sign any convention without
                            prior reference to the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>In the event that there should be any tendency on the part of the

                            the installation and maintenance of radio and meteorological facilities,
                            the delegation should point out that in the present state of the
                            development of international air navigation, all possible contributions
                            to the science should be welcomed and that any attempt to restrict these
                            services would hinder rather than assist the cause of rapid aerial
                            transportation which is the objective of the conference. While
                            encouraging the development of radio and meteorological facilities by
                            the various Governments, the delegation should, for the reasons above
                            stated, oppose any attempt on the part of those Governments to restrict
                            the use by aviation companies of their own facilities. Sincere
                            cooperation between the Governments and the companies will obviously
                            serve the best interests of both. Furthermore, such cooperation would
                            have the advantage of distributing more evenly among the companies and
                            the Governments concerned the heavy cost of operating these expensive
                            services.</p>

                        <p>The delegates should bear in mind that the radio requirements of air
                            services constitute only one phase of the problems relating to the
                            organization and coordination of international radio services on a
                            cooperative basis. It is believed that a discussion of questions
                            relating to radio at the Lima Conference should be limited to a
                            consideration of the nature of the radio cooperation which is required
                            solely by the air services. Even as regards the technical problems
                            relating to the methods of administering radio aids to air navigation,
                            it is suggested that consideration might quite properly be given to a
                            reference of such problems to the Inter-American Radio Conference which
                            is scheduled to convene in Habana, November 1, 1937.<note n="7"

                            One has only to examine the voluminous documents issued by that

                            development of international public air law.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that in connection with a discussion of public
                            international air law one or more of the delegations may bring up the
                            question of recommending that the American Republics become parties to
                            the International Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation
                            signed at Paris on October 13, 1919, or that they adopt portions of that
                            Convention or its annexes. This Convention was signed on behalf of the
                            United States of America but has not been ratified by the United States.
                            Argentina, Peru and Uruguay are <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0214"
                            />parties to the Convention. Panama, Bolivia and Chile were at one time
                            parties to the Paris Convention but have withdrawn from participation in
                            the Convention.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has never deemed it to be advisable
                            to make any public announcement of its reasons for not ratifying the
                            Paris Convention but finds it necessary at this time to invite the
                            attention of the delegation to certain objectionable features of the
                            Convention, copies of which will be made available to the delegation. It
                            is to be observed that the Convention contains Annexes A–H which embody
                            very important technical regulations designed to give effect to the
                            Convention. It will be noted from the examination of these annexes that
                            they are very lengthy and complicated. They are, with the exception of
                            Annex H relating to customs procedure, subject to frequent changes by
                            the International Commission for Air Navigation, a permanent
                            organization created under the terms of Article XXXIV of the Convention.
                            As applied to the United States, if the Convention should be ratified by
                            the Government of the United States, the regulations as adopted by the
                            International Commission for Air Navigation would be binding on the
                            United States without the Government of this country having an
                            opportunity to determine whether they would be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>It is very doubtful whether an organization composed largely of
                            representatives of European countries would be in a position to adopt
                            regulations that would be entirely adaptable to flying conditions in the
                            territories of the American Republics. Taking as an illustration the
                            technical requirements of the Paris Convention in regard to
                            airworthiness requirements for aircraft, it is to be observed that the
                            Government of the United States has by pursuing an independent course in
                            the formulation of its airworthiness requirements succeeded in building
                            up a set of such requirements which, it is believed, are superior to
                            those of many countries, including some that are parties to the Paris
                            Convention.</p>
                        <p>While it is believed to be desirable to endeavor to refrain from any
                            severe criticism of the Paris Convention which might unnecessarily
                            antagonize the proponents of world wide uniformity in the regulation of
                            aerial navigation, or the Secretariat of the International Commission
                            for Air Navigation with which the Government of the United States is on
                            friendly terms in the matter of the exchange of aeronautical data for
                            publication, the delegation should nevertheless take a firm position in
                            stating that in the formulation of a code of international public air
                            law, the Governments of the American Republics should be primarily
                            interested in the adoption of measures that are adaptable to flying
                            conditions in the American Republics, and that while it would of course
                            be appropriate in the drawing up of such a <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205"
                                facs="0215"/>code to give due consideration to the provisions of all
                            existing codes as embodied in the multilateral or bilateral conventions,
                            it should not be the purpose of the framers of the code for the American
                            Republics to assume that the Paris Convention necessarily constitutes
                            the best model to follow or that that Convention should be generally
                            adopted by the American Republics.</p>
                        <p>A separate organization, known as the International Technical Committee
                            of Aerial Legal Experts (C. I. T. E. J. A.) was organized in 1926 for
                            the purpose of drawing up a comprehensive code of international <hi
                                rend="italic">private</hi> air law. The committee has held at least
                            two sessions annually since its organization and has drawn up several
                            draft international conventions on various subjects of international
                            private air law. Some of the draft conventions drafted by the C. I. T.
                            E. J. A. have already been referred to diplomatic conferences for final
                            adoption and signature. The preliminary draft of the convention relating
                            to international air transportation, including important provisions
                            regarding the liability of the air carrier for damages caused in the

                        <p>The delegates of the United States to the Pan American Commercial
                            Conference which met in Buenos Aires May 26–July [<hi rend="italic"
                                >June</hi>] 19, 1935, were instructed to propose the adoption of a
                            resolution urging that the various governments study the rules of the
                            Warsaw Convention. The Conference approved a resolution recommending
                            that the governments “members of the Pan American Union adopt the
                            Convention of Warsaw”. It is still the view of the Government of the
                            United States that the provisions of the Warsaw Convention might well be
                            given a thorough study by the Governments of the American Republics
                            which have not yet become parties to this convention.</p>

                            Latin American countries on the C. I. T. E. J. A. have been present at
                            meetings only as observers. It appears, however, that a number of Latin
                            American countries have participated in diplomatic conferences which
                            adopted and signed conventions based upon drafts prepared by the C. I.
                            T. E. J. A. as shown in a tabulation included in the data in the files
                            of the delegation. The United States of America is represented in the

                            taken an active part in the deliberations of that body.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that it would be advisable to await further studies by the
                            C. I. T. E. J. A. of questions of international private air law before
                            determining whether it would be in the interests of the American
                            Republics to undertake a separate study of such questions. Additional
                            information in regard to the work of the C. I. T. E. J. A. and the
                            extent of participation therein by the American Republics is included in
                            the data being furnished the delegation.</p>
                        <p>So far as aerial war limitations are concerned, the delegation should
                            definitely take the position that the work of the conference should be
                            limited to a consideration of international civil air navigation. A
                            reference to extraneous subjects such as military aviation would, it is
                            believed, raise controversial questions of a political nature that would
                            greatly impair the usefulness of the Lima Conference, and the delegation
                            is not authorized to discuss such questions.</p>
                        <p>Having specific reference to Item B, discussed above, the delegation of
                            the United States may agree to cooperate in the making of

                            Inter-American Aeronautical Committee. It is believed, however, that
                            more practical results would be achieved if such committee should limit
                            its studies to the development of international public air law.</p>
                        <p>It should be borne in mind in this relation that there already exists a

                        <p>It is clearly evident from the quoted articles of the Habana Convention,
                            which was signed by representatives of all the American Republics, that
                            the framers of the Convention intended that any action taken along the
                            lines indicated in these articles would be for the purpose of carrying
                            out the general provisions of the Convention and making it effective.
                            The delegation should in this connection definitely take the position
                            that any action taken by the Lima Conference on technical questions that
                            might fairly be regarded as coming within the scope of Articles XXXI and
                            XXXII of the Habana Convention, will be directly related to this
                            Convention and for the purpose of making the Convention effective.</p>
                        <p>While it is uncertain as to what may be proposed at Lima in regard to the
                            scope and authority of the proposed permanent committee, it would seem
                            to the Government of the United States to be desirable that any
                            recommendations of such permanent committee be made subject to
                            acceptance at periodical international conferences of American
                            States.</p>
                        <p>It is realized that difficulties will probably arise in discussions as to
                            the scope of the work to be undertaken by a permanent American
                            aeronautical committee and as to the frequency of its sessions, et
                            cetera. The extent of authority to be given such a committee will be of
                            special importance. While the Government of the United States would be
                            glad to cooperate in the work of such a committee, if organized, <pb
                                n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0218"/>this Government could not be
                            bound by any decisions of the committee unless and until accepted by
                            this Government.</p>
                        <p>If it is decided to organize a permanent Inter-American aeronautical
                            committee, the delegation should indicate that it is the view of the
                            Government of the United States that any uniform regulations that the
                            committee might eventually draft would be for the purpose of giving
                            effect to the Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation as it is now
                            worded or as it may later be revised. It would be appropriate also for
                            the delegation to propose that such a committee might well devote its
                            efforts toward the drafting of annexes containing technical regulations
                            to supplement and carry out the provisions of the Convention. It is
                            believed, however, that there will not be sufficient time at Lima to
                            undertake a revision of the Convention. In view of the extensive studies
                            that would be required before undertaking such a revision, it is
                            possible that the members of the Lima Conference may, if this matter is
                            taken up, desire to determine the most desirable method of approaching
                            the task of revision and the drafting of regulations. In such event, the
                            delegation, provided it perceives no objections to the method proposed,
                            may indicate the willingness of this Government to cooperate. As of
                            possible interest, data are in the files of the delegation showing the
                            results of a preliminary study of the Habana Convention made by
                            officials of this Government.</p>
                        <p>At its session of April 29, 1932, the Permanent Committee of the
                            International Public Health Office adopted an International Sanitary
                            Convention for Aerial Navigation. The convention was opened for
                            signature at The Hague on April 12, 1933.<note n="12" xml:id="d210fn12"

                            In general the effect of the convention will be to facilitate
                            international air transportation as much as possible consistently with
                            the necessity of guarding against the introduction of infectious
                            communicable diseases. Without definite and uniform sanitary regulations
                            international air transportation might be seriously impeded in the event
                            of the outbreak of quarantinable diseases. The delegates to the Ninth
                            Pan American Sanitary Conference convened at Buenos Aires on November

                            Governments of the following American Republics: United States of
                            America, Bolivia, Brazil and Chile. In view of the importance of the

                        <p>2. The Inter-American Technical Aviation Conference has concluded its
                            work in an atmosphere of cordiality and friendship. The Conference
                            restricted its action to the adoption of resolutions, recommendations
                            and motions. Santiago, Chile, was designated as the meetings for a
                            second Aviation Conference to be held at a date as yet undetermined.</p>
                        <p>The following countries participated in the Conference: Argentina,
                            Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, United
                            States of America, Uruguay, Venezuela.</p>

                        <p>The Conference provided for the establishment of an organization to serve
                            the aeronautical interests of the American Republics known as the
                            Permanent American Aeronautical Committee (Comisión Aeronautica
                            Permanente Americana) (C.A.P.A.). The delegations of Argentina, Brazil
                            and Uruguay voted in opposition to this resolution indicating their
                            desire for immediate universal action in this regard as opposed to the
                            thought of the other nations present that the most practical approach to
                            universal cooperation would be the establishment first of a regional
                            organization to coordinate the views of the American states.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the Commission is to work toward the unification and
                            codification of international public and private air law to develop <pb
                                n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0220"/>and coordinate technical
                            subjects of mutual concern including the correlation of local air routes
                            and services with international air routes and services. The
                            establishment of national commissions in the several American Republics
                            for the purpose of cooperating with the C. A. P. A. is recommended.</p>
                        <p>The Permanent American Aeronautical Commission will meet periodically in
                            the capitals of the American Republics at intervals not to exceed 2
                            years. The first meeting is to be held in Bogotá. The Commission will
                            not have plenipotentiary powers and any draft conversations [<hi
                                rend="italic">conventions?</hi>] which it may formulate will be
                            submitted for approval to special diplomatic aviation conferences or to
                            the periodic international conferences of American states. When such
                            conventions have received general approval by the American states
                            C.A.P.A. may propose the meeting of a universal aviation conference or
                            adopt other measures with a view to giving a universal character to its

                        <p>Recommendations were adopted regarding the following: (1) the designation
                            of air ports of entry in the several Republics; (2) air transportation
                            documents in which the single document relating to the carriage of
                            passengers, goods and baggage was recommended; (3) the elimination of
                            consular invoices for air transportation purposes; (4) establishment of
                            special courses on air law in colleges and universities; (5) an increase
                            in the frequency of international air services; (6) exemption from
                            duties on gasoline, lubricants and spare parts used in aviation. The
                            United States delegation pointed out that there might be difficulties in
                            complying with this latter recommendation due to the independent
                            authority of the States of the United States in this connection.</p>

                            as related to aviation: (1) that the Habana Conference allocate
                            exclusive aviation frequencies; (2) use of band 200 to 400 kilocycles
                            for air navigation aids as in the United States; (3) and (4) cooperation
                            by the Governments in synoptic transmission and installation of air
                            navigation aids; (5) compulsory installation of two-way radio on
                            passenger aircraft; (6) standards of field strength and interference in
                            low frequency band to be established by Habana Conference; (7)
                            cooperative frequency measurements; (8) use of designation of radio
                            waves by frequency in kilocycles alone. Wave length meters to be
                            dropped.</p>

                            countries was given considerable study and resolutions were adopted
                            providing for close cooperation to accomplish this end, also for
                            obtaining adherence to the rules of the International Meteorological
                            Organization. It is expected that as a result of the Conference
                            uniformity of information and the establishment of twice daily

                        <p>The Conference adopted a resolution dealing with sanitary aviation. This
                            resolution appeared to deal primarily with individual problems
                            pertaining to the countries of South America. The Government of Uruguay
                            was charged with the task of promoting the study of sanitary aviation
                            including the calling of a special conference on this matter. It was
                            also recommended that the relation of medical science to special
                            aviation problems be studied and that cooperation between aerial medical
                            services be promoted. The United States delegation abstained from voting
                            on this resolution.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Touring aviation</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The Conference devoted much time and consideration to the strengthening
                            of friendly ties between the American Republics through the development
                            of sporting and touring aviation. A resolution recommended the
                            establishment of an inter-American Civil Aeronautic Federation
                            (Federación Americana Aeronautica Civil). Mexico was selected as the
                            headquarters of the Federation. The F. A. A. C. is to foster a close
                            cooperation between the national aero clubs through an interchange of
                            publications and information, the promotion of meetings and racing and
                            other appropriate means.</p>
                        <p>Other recommendations relate to: (1) the encouragement of air marking
                            through the construction of signs visible from the air; (2)
                            encouragement of aerial touring; (3) tourists passports—the United
                            States delegation stated that the Government of the United States had
                            not become a party to the convention relative to tourist passports

                            despatch by Heath indicating the possibility that negotiations may begin
                            soon on a commercial agreement with Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine attitude of the moment seems more favorable toward giving
                            us better treatment than it has been for some time and I note signs of a
                            willingness to do more provided they have some assurances of a trade
                            agreement being negotiated in the near future.</p>
                        <p>A few days ago the Under Secretary of Finance and the head of the

                            suggested to the Embassy that it might be possible to come to some
                            verbal arrangement whereby Argentina would in fact—if not [?]—grant
                            official exchange to [?] our exports to Argentina for a period of say 6
                            months with the understanding that trade treaty negotiations begin
                            before that time had elapsed. In case negotiations should not begin then
                            the Argentines would revert to the <hi rend="italic">status quo
                                ante</hi>. A suggestion along similar lines was made on June 15 also
                            by the Under Secretary, and formed a part of the Embassy’s telegram 88,

                        <p>I should appreciate any comment from the Department particularly on the
                            likelihood of negotiations beginning.</p>
                        <p>Were the Embassy accordingly to assure the Argentines that trade
                            negotiations would begin shortly or within some specific period, I feel
                            that we should be able to secure better exchange treatment, if not
                            entire relief from the present discrimination. And if possible a strong
                            intimation of our hope would be helpful.</p>

                        <p>83. Your telegram no. 158, August 26, 6 p.m. For your strictly
                            confidential personal information the outlook is as follows: if
                            deliberations now in progress (partly owing to your telegram) result in
                            an affirmative decision by policy-making officials it will be possible
                            to announce trade agreement negotiations with Argentina within the very
                            near future.</p>
                        <p>You will understand that although the future course of the trade
                            agreement program is now receiving consideration, matters have not yet
                            reached a stage permitting the Department to give a definite commitment
                            on opening of negotiations. You may properly say, however, that a fresh
                            study is being made of the possibility of an Argentine agreement and
                            that there is every indication that this study will be completed
                            shortly, perhaps within a week or 10 days. Pending a decision, it would
                            be highly desirable of course if this Government could proceed on the
                            assumption that the arrangement suggested by the Under Secretary of
                            Finance could be considered a firm offer. In this connection, you should
                            impress upon him and other responsible officials that such an
                            arrangement would undoubtedly create a most favorable impression in the
                            United States. You could usefully repeat the argument that the
                            Department has been under considerable pressure from interests in the
                            United States as a result of continuance in the face of present trade
                            trends of exchange discrimination against them in Argentina. Correction
                            of this situation might assist materially in forming a body of opinion
                            in this country sufficiently influential to offset the pressure which is
                            certain to be exerted against the agreement by various agricultural
                            groups.</p>

                        <p>167. Department’s 83, September 3, 1 p.m. The Embassy has already
                            discussed the subject informally with the Ministry of Finance and I
                            expect to discuss it personally with the Minister<note n="4"

                        <p>182. My 167, September 7, 5 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] p.m. The pertinent
                            portions of the Department’s telegram No. 83, September 3, 1 p.m. having
                            been communicated to the Ministry of Finance and the Exchange Control
                            Board, I wish to report as follows. There is still a tendency among
                            officials here to consider existing discriminatory exchange regulations
                            as a bargaining point. This was implied by the Under Secretary in a
                            subsequent conversation with a member of the Embassy when he indicated
                            that while Argentina may be willing to make the exchange offer a firm
                            one he fears that even if announcement should be made of the trade
                            treaty negotiations, bases for a satisfactory treaty might be lacking.
                            Under Secretary also pointed out that any concessions which either or
                            both sides may request would have to be made in substitution of those
                            formulated several years ago. He went so far as to suggest the
                            advisability of our sending a mission here to study Argentina’s requests
                            to which he was told that the concessions Argentina desired had, we
                            imagined, in the past been sent to the Argentine Embassy in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Head of the Exchange Control Office told Ravndal<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d215fn5">Christian M. Ravndal, American Consul at Buenos
                                Aires.</note> yesterday that he had advised Central Bank and Under
                            Secretary of Finance that now would be an opportune time to grant full
                            official exchange for imports from the United States provided we gave
                            satisfactory—though informal and not binding—assurances that trade
                            agreement negotiations will lead up to suitable concessions to
                            Argentina. Louro stated, however, that it was not his intention to use
                            exchange as a lever.</p>
                        <p>I hope to see the Minister of Finance early next week.</p>

                        <p>185. My 182 of September 24, 6 p.m. The Minister of Finance is apparently
                            not yet ready to discuss the matter with me, the delay as <pb n="216"
                                xml:id="pg_216" facs="0226"/>explained by the Under Secretary being

                        <p>However, yesterday afternoon I pressed the matter with the Minister for

                            asked me to give him a brief memorandum which he said that he would
                            support before the Minister of Finance. He added that the question
                            possessed broad political aspects which financial authorities were
                            inclined to overlook and declared that the conclusion of an agreement of
                            even very limited range would yet constitute an opening and helpful
                            wedge for further mutual concessions.</p>

                            objection please present the following confidential memorandum to the
                            Argentine Government.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The United States Government has carefully considered the
                                arrangement recently suggested to the American Embassy by the Under
                                Secretary of Finance. Its understanding of the proposal is that
                                Argentina would grant official exchange for all imports from the
                                United States for a period of 6 months in the expectation that
                                trade-agreement negotiations would be initiated within that period,
                                and that, if within 6 months such negotiations shall in fact have
                                been begun, this exchange treatment will continue thereafter.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government is deeply gratified that the Argentine
                                Government appears prepared to take so constructive a step at this
                                time. It hopes that the Argentine Government will put the suggested
                                arrangement into operation now and begin to grant official exchange
                                for all imports of United States goods.</p>
                            <p>Although there are a number of factors in the situation which will
                                have a bearing upon whether the United States will be able to begin
                                formal negotiations within 6 months, among which one of the most
                                important is the prospect for expanding foreign markets for United
                                States agricultural products by means of additional trade
                                agreements, it seems to the United States Government at the present
                                time to be quite possible that events will so shape themselves that
                                this can be done. Meanwhile, in order to facilitate the rapid
                                conclusion of the negotiations as soon as it becomes possible to
                                undertake them, this Government would be prepared to enter into
                                informal and confidential discussions regarding the possible terms
                                of an agreement. Inasmuch as similar discussions have been held in

                                assumed that the exploratory conversations now contemplated would be
                                held in Washington. The Department would be pleased to commence such
                                conversations immediately, or as soon as appropriate instructions
                                are received by the Argentine Ambassador.”</p>

                        <p>In presenting the foregoing memorandum to the Argentine Government you
                            should emphasize that this Government is not making any information
                            public which would indicate that trade-agreement negotiations with
                            Argentina are impending and that in reply to any inquiries which may be
                            received it intends to state merely that exploratory conversations in
                            regard to trade matters of mutual interest are being carried on as they
                            have been from time to time in the past. Please request the Argentine
                            Government to treat the matter with similar reserve in order that the
                            disadvantages of premature publicity may be avoided.</p>

                        <p>197. My 194, October 14, 5 p.m. 1 yesterday inquired of the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs what progress was being made by the Commission in
                            question. He said that he was still discussing the matter with other
                            Ministries and that his idea was that this Commission when appointed
                            should discuss the entire subject informally and without engagement with
                            a commission from the Embassy to be appointed by me.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I believed it was rather the view of my Government that
                            any discussion which might be undertaken should be carried on in
                            Washington as he would see by reference to my confidential memorandum. I
                            added that, as I had pointed out in my note of February 6, the
                            application of the surtax was considered by my Government as a
                            discrimination and that I rather felt that elimination of this
                            discrimination should take precedence over anything else. He <pb n="219"
                                xml:id="pg_219" facs="0229"/>then showed me a telegram from
                            Ambassador Espil dated September 29 indicating that the Department was
                            ready to begin informal discussions but containing no reference to
                            exchange. With regard to this latter subject the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs seemed to feel that to grant official exchange to all imports
                            from the United States would upset the local exchange market. I replied
                            that this seemed an exaggeration and that with the possible exception of
                            automobiles I thought the effect would be slight.</p>
                        <p>A member of the Foreign Office intimated in conversation yesterday to the
                            Embassy that he thought the first point to be taken up by any Commission
                            which might be appointed would be whether Argentina could grant official
                            exchange to all American imports for 6 months as previously
                            suggested.</p>

                        <p>Your October 15 [<hi rend="italic">5</hi>]. I yesterday sent a personal
                            note to Saavedra Lamas strongly stressing the importance of time
                            element, adding that it was one which was beginning to cause me grave
                            concern and urging him to instruct Espil to begin informal discussions
                            in that city. I made no reference in my note to exchange or to his
                            suggestion for local committees to discuss general subject here.</p>
                        <p>My motive in writing rather than in seeking an interview just now was to
                            avoid further interminable and fruitless discussions and to emphasize in

                        <p>Mr. Sayre inquired of Mr. Espil whether any information had been received
                            regarding the removal of Argentine exchange discrimination. Mr. Espil
                            said that he had no information from his Government <pb n="220"
                                xml:id="pg_220" facs="0230"/>on this subject and went on to say that
                            he thought there was a good deal of misunderstanding regarding this
                            matter. He said that the removal of the exchange discriminations was not
                            a simple problem that could be easily and quickly solved; that he felt
                            that it could only be dealt with in relation to trade agreement
                            negotiations. He was not very explicit as to exactly what he meant by
                            this, but said, among other things, that at the time of announcement of
                            trade agreement negotiations, at least something could be done about
                            removing the discrimination, and that a complete solution of the
                            question could be worked out in the course of the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre stated that failure of the Argentine Government to remove the
                            discriminations at an early date would greatly increase the difficulty
                            of trade agreement negotiations from our standpoint. He explained that
                            the negotiation of an agreement with Argentina involved sufficient
                            difficulties in view of the fact that it would have to provide for
                            concessions on agricultural products, and that it is highly important
                            that we should not go into those negotiations with the additional
                            handicap of continued discrimination by Argentina against American
                            trade. Mr. Sayre made it clear that he did not now lay down any
                            condition, but that it is highly important from our standpoint that the
                            exchange problem be adjusted at an early date, and in any event prior to
                            any public announcement of trade agreement negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the program for further discussions on the
                            terms of a trade agreement. Mr. Sayre emphasized that any discussion of
                            the products involved could not of course involve any definite
                            commitments on our part as this is not legally possible prior to a
                            public announcement and hearings. Mr. Espil said he quite understood
                            this. Mr. Sayre inquired whether the Argentine Government would like to

                            thought it would be unnecessary to add anything to the list of requests
                            at this time and asked whether we could not in the course of our studies
                            consider any products which might occur to us in which the Argentine
                            Government might be interested. Mr. Sayre told Mr. Espil that our
                            studies on products for consideration in the trade agreement
                            negotiations are virtually completed and that our proposals, in as
                            definite form as they can be made prior to public hearings, would be
                            available in a week or 10 days, or two weeks at the very latest. These
                            proposals as to the possible terms of the agreement would include our
                            proposals as to the text of the general provisions.</p>
                        <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>Mr. Espil indicated that the foregoing arrangement is entirely
                            satisfactory to him. He said that a Mr. Garcia Arias who is an expert on
                            trade matters and is now stationed in London, will be assigned to the
                            staff of the Argentine Embassy here. Mr. Arias has not yet sailed from
                            London and presumably will not be here before our studies have been
                            completed. However, when the proposals are completed, they could be
                            discussed tentatively with Mr. Espil pending the arrival of Mr. Arias.
                            The real purpose of Mr. Arias assignment would of course be kept
                            confidential. It will be given out that he is assigned as a regular
                            member of the Embassy staff.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espil then referred to the Sanitary Convention<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d224fn11">Signed May 24, 1935, <ref

                            its receiving Senate approval. In view of this he raised the question
                            whether Section 306 of the Tariff Act<note n="12" xml:id="d224fn12"
                                >Approved June 17, 1930; 46 Stat. 590, 689. Section 306 prohibited
                                in certain cases the importation of cattle, sheep, swine, and
                                meats.</note> could not be modified by the trade agreement. He said
                            his study of the Trade Agreements Act<note n="13" xml:id="d224fn13"
                                >Approved June 12, 1934; 48 Stat. 943.</note> indicated that this
                            can legally be done. Mr. Sayre replied that he thought it would be
                            extremely unwise to connect the Sanitary Convention with the trade
                            agreement as it would cause an emotional reaction against the trade
                            agreement. He said that he had been giving some thought to the question
                            and while he had not mentioned it to the Secretary, he was inclined to
                            the personal view that consideration might be given to a statutory
                            amendment of Section 306. He said that this only represented his
                            personal thought on the subject and he was not sure whether this would
                            be feasible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espil said that he had under consideration the question whether
                            Argentine beef might not be brought into the free port at New York and
                            distributed from there to Caribbean countries and elsewhere, and also
                            sold to ships as ships stores. He said there was a legal question
                            whether landing the beef at the free port would be considered
                            “importation” within the meaning of Section 306 of the Tariff Act. Mr.
                            Sayre offered to look into the question for him. Mr. Espil expressed his
                            appreciation but did not press the point.</p>

                        <p>210. My 207, November 2, 6 p.m., last paragraph. In the hope of
                            expediting action I propose suggesting to the Minister of Finance in the
                            interview which I hope to have with him very shortly that he delegate
                            one or more persons from his Ministry to discuss with representatives of
                            the Embassy the general question of exchange discrimination.</p>
                        <p>Such a procedure would appear to be helpful particularly in view of the
                            Minister of Finance’s tendency towards excessive delay and

                        <p>I called up, on the telephone, Mr. Espil with respect to the Argentine
                            trade agreement negotiations. I told him that we were working hard on
                            the lists of commodities which I had promised to give him during our
                            last conversation together. I said that the lists had been prepared by
                            one of our subcommittees but that they did not satisfy me because the
                            list of our requests from Argentina was too inclusive. I added that I
                            felt sure it would protract negotiations if we handed <pb n="223"
                                xml:id="pg_223" facs="0233"/>to Argentina a list containing every
                            concession which might be desired and that my personal idea was to cut
                            our requests down to the minimum so as to shorten the negotiations and
                            make practicable as early a conclusion as possible. For this reason I
                            said that we had asked for a revision of the lists and therefore would
                            not be able to hand him the lists quite as soon as I had hoped. I added
                            that the preparation of the lists was being given precedence over
                            everything else and that we hoped to hand them to him, if all goes well,
                            by the end of next week although we could not make any definite promises
                            to this effect. Mr. Espil replied that he understood. He said that he
                            was anxious to get the lists at the earliest moment possible since he
                            did not feel that he could ask his Government to send an expert here or
                            to take any steps with respect to the trade agreement until he had the
                            lists in his hands. He said that there had been so many delays and so
                            often hopes for negotiations had been deferred that he did not feel in a
                            position to communicate with his Government about the matter until he
                            actually had the lists.</p>
                        <p>I also told Mr. Espil, in the strictest confidence, that we were very
                            hopeful that announcement could be made of the intent to negotiate with
                            the British Government in the very early future. I said that our hope
                            was that we could make the preliminary announcement concerning Argentine
                            negotiations shortly after the announcement of the British negotiations.
                            I went on to express the hope that, when the announcement of the
                            Argentine negotiations takes place, announcement could be made at the
                            same time of some favorable action by the Argentine Government with
                            respect to the exchange problem. Mr. Espil replied, as before, that he
                            felt doubtful whether the Argentine Government could do much in this
                            respect until actual negotiations are in progress. I explained to him
                            how important it seemed to me that some announcement should be made at
                            the time of the first announcement of negotiations so as to present an
                            attack by our enemies and by an unfavorable press. Mr. Espil replied
                            that he understood this but that he did not see how he could ask his
                            Government, until he had the actual lists, to take any definite steps in
                            the matter,—saying that his position, because of the protracted delays
                            during the past four years, was very difficult.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of our discussion, I reiterated my statement that we
                            would send the list now being prepared at the very earliest moment
                            possible, and I also promised to get in touch with the Ambassador again
                            when we know more definitely about the date of the expected announcement
                            of the British negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Sayre presented Mr. Espil with the memorandum<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d228fn15"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> indicating
                            our position with respect to the removal of the exchange discrimination
                            in Argentina by the date of the formal announcement of intention to
                            negotiate the trade agreement. The ambassador argued at length and with
                            considerable emphasis that the Argentine Government should not be asked
                            to take “so serious” a step until it had seen how far we could go in
                            granting concessions on Argentine products.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre pointed out that the United States extends to Argentina the
                            benefit of all tariff concessions granted to other countries in trade
                            agreements and otherwise accords most-favored-nation treatment to
                            Argentine commerce. It asks only that before negotiations are instituted
                            both parties be placed on the same footing in this respect by the
                            granting of reciprocal most-favored-nation treatment to American
                            commerce in Argentina. He explained further that it is the settled
                            policy of this Government not to allow discriminations against it to be
                            used as a bargaining lever for obtaining from it specific concessions
                            and tariff reductions, but to conduct negotiations for reciprocal tariff
                            reductions on a basis of non-discrimination of each to the other. Hence
                            it is not our practice to institute trade-agreement negotiations until
                            discriminations against us have been removed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre stated further that the trade agreement with Argentina involves
                            serious political difficulty for this Government and that this
                            difficulty would be so greatly increased as possibly even to endanger
                            the success of the agreement, if we entered into negotiations without
                            first having obtained the removal of the exchange discriminations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espil professed to have serious misgivings as to the difficulties
                            which our proposal would present from the standpoint of the Argentine
                            Government, but indicated that he would submit our proposal to his
                            Government. He then inquired concerning the lists of products which
                            would be involved in the negotiations and was informed that we expect to
                            have available for him by Wednesday, <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"
                                facs="0235"/>lists showing the products on which the United States
                            would probably ask improvement in present treatment, and those on which
                            the United States probably would ask only for a binding of present
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Espil at once inquired whether we were not going to give him a list
                            of the products on which the United States would grant concessions to
                            Argentina. He said it had been his understanding that we would do this.
                            He referred in this connection to an inquiry which we had made at a
                            previous meeting when we had asked if the lists which Argentina had thus
                            far submitted were complete and whether it was desired to add any
                            products to them. He was informed that our purpose in making this
                            inquiry was merely to make sure that we had a complete list of the
                            Argentine requests as a counterpart of the lists covering our requests
                            which we were about to give them; in other words, that our list of
                            requests will complete the picture and that we had not anticipated any
                            further discussion of the Argentine requests in advance of the
                            preliminary announcement of contemplated negotiations.</p>

                            <item>In the light of developments that have recently taken place in
                                connection with the trade-agreements program, the United States
                                Government has given renewed consideration to the question of
                                trade-agreement negotiations with Argentina and to the question of
                                the treatment now being accorded American commerce in respect of the
                                terms on which foreign exchange is obtainable in Argentina, and has
                                reached the following conclusions:</item>

                            <item>If the Argentine Government will assure this Government that it
                                will grant full equality of treatment to United States products with
                                respect to exchange allotments and rates beginning on or before the

                                trade agreement is issued, this Government will issue its
                                “preliminary” announcement of contemplated trade-agreement
                                negotiations within a week after the receipt of this
                                assurance.</item>

                            <item>The statement made in the preceding paragraph is based on the
                                assumption that the Argentine Government is prepared to negotiate
                                the contemplated agreement upon the basis of the unconditional
                                most-favored-nation principle applied to all forms of trade and
                                payments control.</item>

                            <item>Although the public announcement which the United States
                                Government is prepared on this basis to make states only that
                                negotiations <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0236"/>“are
                                contemplated” and is frequently referred to as a “preliminary”
                                announcement, its issuance is this Government’s customary first step
                                in the negotiation of trade agreements and one which it does not
                                take unless it is confident that the ensuing negotiations can be
                                carried without delay to a successful conclusion. The formal notice
                                that this Government intends to negotiate a trade agreement is
                                issued not less than five weeks after the preliminary
                                announcement.</item>

                        <p>Upon appointment made over the telephone, the Argentine Ambassador came
                            in to see me, accompanied by Mr. Irigoyen, the Financial Counselor. The
                            Ambassador wanted to discuss various points connected with the question
                            of the possible inauguration of conversations between ourselves and the
                            Argentine Government for a trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>The points covered were as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Ambassador stated that before cabling to his Government the note
                            which had been presented to him by Mr. Sayre he wanted to be able to
                            advise his Government as to whether we would be willing at once to
                            engage in informal discussions, wholly without commitment, regarding the
                            general outlines of what the trade agreement would be like. He stated
                            that his understanding was that we engaged in such prior informal
                            conversations in many other instances. I replied that he had not given
                            me previous notice over the telephone of this question and that I was
                            not in a position to answer, but that I was sure that Mr. Sayre would be
                            glad to consider it when he met the Ambassador again tomorrow afternoon
                            (of which fact the Ambassador had already apprised me). The Ambassador
                            said he was planning to raise the question again, thereby indicating
                            that he had raised it before with Mr. Sayre, whom he believed to have
                            indicated in turn that we would not enter into such prior informal
                            conversations before agreeing to make formal announcement.</p>
                        <p>(2) He then asked whether, as regards the paragraph in the <hi
                                rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> which had been handed him suggesting
                            that the Argentine Government give us complete unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment in exchange matters, we realized that it
                            might mean we were asking Argentina to dismantle its whole exchange
                            control and surcharge system, and possibly even discard various
                            bilateral agreements to which Argentina is a party. I stated that our
                            intention was simple. <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0237"/>We wished
                            to be assured that American trade would enjoy as favorable exchange
                            treatment as the trade of any other country; and since the trade of some
                            other countries, e. g., Great Britain, was given official exchange for
                            virtually all its commodities and paid no surcharge tax, we felt that
                            similarly all American trade should be given the same treatment. If that
                            were done, our request would be satisfied. Mr. Irigoyen stated that he
                            understood.</p>
                        <p>He raised the hypothetical question of what attitude we would take
                            provided Argentina maintained some form of exchange control or exchange
                            tax on specified commodities, irrespective of their origin. I replied
                            that I could not give a definite answer offhand, but my surmise was that
                            if the commodities were selected on the basis of some understandable and
                            fair principle, so that it was clear there was no national
                            discrimination, we would have no objection in principle, though we might
                            regulate the restriction.</p>
                        <p>I arranged with the Ambassador and Mr. Irigoyen for Mr. Irigoyen to
                            return tomorrow morning for further technical discussion of the exchange
                            policy of Argentina and the exchange treatment accorded to this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>(3) Just before leaving the Ambassador brought out the general question
                            of why we could not wait to have this exchange matter settled as part of
                            the trade agreement and I stated fairly emphatically our view that this
                            was an injurious discrimination which the Argentine Government was in a
                            position to rectify by its own action and without connection with trade
                            agreement negotiations.</p>
                        <p>(4) The Ambassador asked me several scattered questions as to what might
                            be contained in a trade agreement, and I told him that I couldn’t inform
                            him at all reliably on specific points, but he could be sure our
                            attitude would be one of positive endeavor to find terms of agreement,
                            as shown by our whole record in this field.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed a wish that I should be present tomorrow during
                            his conversation with Mr. Sayre and I said that I would mention that
                            fact to Mr. Sayre.</p>

                        <p>The Argentine Ambassador called upon me this morning at my request.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador if he had had any word since the arrival in Buenos
                            Aires of his Financial Counselor, Mr. Irigoyen, <pb n="228"
                                xml:id="pg_228" facs="0238"/>who flew down to Argentina last week
                            taking with him the file of communications from the Department of State
                            with regard to the trade agreement negotiations. The Ambassador said
                            that he had no word as yet, although he expected to speak on the
                            telephone to Mr. Irigoyen tomorrow, December 7. He showed me, however,
                            an air mail letter which he had just received, dated November 30, from
                            the Under Secretary of Agriculture in which letter Señor Brebbia
                            expressed to the Ambassador the opinion that any elimination of exchange
                            discrimination against the United States before the negotiations for a
                            trade agreement had been definitely concluded would be exceedingly
                            difficult in as much as not only was the treaty relationship between
                            Argentina and Great Britain involved, but also every department of the
                            Government would have to be consulted. He further alleged that in these
                            last weeks of the life of the Government of Argentina it was obviously
                            difficult to obtain any decision from the outgoing authorities on a
                            matter of particular importance, especially in the present case, because
                            the President-elect in his campaign addresses had indicated his
                            intention of keeping exchange control intact unless the international
                            trade situation improved to a point where the restrictions could be
                            safely removed without detriment to Argentine interests. The salient
                            point in the letter which the Ambassador showed me, however, was where
                            Señor Brebbia specifically stated that in his judgment the exchange
                            restrictions should be continued so that they might be used as a
                            bargaining point.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would let me know as soon as he had any word
                            from Buenos Aires in this matter and I again reminded him of our hope
                            that President-elect Ortiz might visit Washington before he took office
                            but that the time was now short if he was to leave Buenos Aires in order
                            to visit Washington and return before February 20.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm to the
                            Department that the matter of the discriminatory surtax on merchandise
                            of American origin entering Argentina without prior permit is receiving
                            the unremitting attention of the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, as the Department will have gathered from my telegram No.
                            245 of December 17, 1 PM<note n="16" xml:id="d233fn16">Not
                                printed.</note> and previous communications, an inter-ministerial
                            commission of the Argentine Government is now engaged in studying
                            material brought here by the Financial Attaché of the Argentine Embassy
                            in Washington with a view to determining whether this government is
                            desirous of taking steps looking to negotiating a trade agreement with
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Financial Attaché, Mr. Irigoyen, has called twice at the Embassy, and
                            while guarded in his statements, gave the impression that the general
                            subject is receiving primary and active consideration and that within a
                            relatively brief period some conclusion will be reached. This
                            information has been confirmed in its general lines by statements made
                            to Mr. Wilson<note n="17" xml:id="d233fn17">Orme Wilson, First Secretary
                                of Embassy.</note> of the Embassy by the Chief of the Commercial
                            Section of the Foreign Office, who also informed him that the matter of
                            the exchange surtax is under close study by this inter-ministerial
                            commission. He gave Mr. Wilson further to understand that this
                            commission would in all probability reach a decision within the next few
                            days as to the concessions in the matter of exchange which it may be
                            possible for the Argentine Government to accord to imports from the
                            United States. Although Mr. Torriani stated that the subject of exchange
                            was extremely involved and complicated, he appeared to indicate that
                            concessions would be granted and that the list of American merchandise
                            now being granted official exchange will be extended.</p>
                        <p>The Department will recall (see my telegram No. 210 of November 3, 4 PM)
                            that this subject of exchange was to have been discussed by <pb n="230"
                                xml:id="pg_230" facs="0240"/>a fact-finding commission made up of
                            representatives of the Embassy and of the Argentine Ministry of Finance.
                            However, in answer to a suggestion made by Mr. Wilson that it should be
                            possible to discuss the exchange problem separately from the trade
                            agreement the Under-Secretary of Finance, Dr. Saenz, clearly indicated
                            that it is the desire of the Argentine Government to tie the exchange
                            question and the trade agreement together (Since the foregoing was
                            drafted the Under-Secretary of Finance has telephoned to the Embassy to
                            the effect that inasmuch as the exchange situation is also being
                            examined by the commission above referred to, which may solve the
                            question promptly, it seems to the Minister inopportune for the
                            representatives of this Embassy and his Ministry to confer just
                            now).</p>
                        <p>To the foregoing should be added remarks made by Mr. Irigoyen in his last
                            visit, when he said in reply to my reference to this discrimination,
                            that the Argentine Government could not put an end to a system which had
                            prevailed for four or five years in return for a vague hope of
                            negotiating a trade agreement. I thought it appropriate to remark that I
                            felt convinced that the American Government would never sign a trade
                            agreement which would continue in effect a procedure which it had
                            repeatedly declared in formal fashion we considered to be
                            discriminatory. To this he replied that he assumed that under any
                            agreement arrived at the American merchandise would be on a plane of
                            entire equality with that of other foreign countries with which
                            Argentina has trade agreements.</p>
                        <p>While, as will be gathered from the foregoing, the entire subject of
                            exchange, as well as of matters relating to the possibility of
                            initiating negotiations for a trade agreement, continues in a fluid
                            state, the following extracts from a strictly confidential letter

                                    and other commodities which would gratify a large number of
                                    American exporters and build up support for a trade agreement
                                    without involving a big increase in the total grant of official
                                    exchange. (This last confirms the information submitted to the
                                    Ambassador in my letter of November 30, 1937).</p>
                                <p>“The reasons advanced as to why Argentina will not abolish the
                                    20% surcharge on all United States products, when preliminary
                                    hearings are announced by the Department, are (1) Argentina’s
                                    balance of payments position with the United States, (2) the
                                    prospects of lesser exports in 1938 than in 1937, and (3) the
                                    fact that in the cases of Finland and Czechoslovakia, countries
                                    with which Argentina has trade agreements, the 20% surcharge is
                                    still operative.</p>
                                <p>“President-elect Ortiz will be consulted by the committee and it
                                    is thought that in no event will the trade agreement be
                                    concluded until he assumes office.”</p>

                        <p>I am transmitting to Your Excellency the text of the memorandum reply
                            prepared, by the Commission of Officials, which has been approved by the
                            Ministries of Hacienda and of Agriculture: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Argentine Government has seen with pleasure the
                                    communication that the Government of the United States has
                                    considered anew the subject relative to the negotiation of an
                                    agreement of commercial reciprocity between the two
                                    countries.</p>
                                <p>“The Argentine Government hopes that the negotiations proposed by
                                    the United States Government may arrive at a happy termination
                                    thus creating a definitive basis for the removal of regulations
                                    such as that of the surcharge on foreign exchange, and others,
                                    thus contributing to the reestablishment of a régime assuring
                                    the increase of commercial exchange and the economic cooperation
                                    of the two countries in the international order.</p>
                                <p>“In that sense the emergency measures which the Government has
                                    taken in order to protect national economy owe their origin to
                                    the necessity of preventing disturbances proceeding from
                                    disequilibrium of the balance of payments produced by the
                                    difficulties which other countries have opposed to the free
                                    entry of Argentine products, especially excessive tariffs, and
                                    by disturbances in the international markets of capital.</p>
                                <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0242"/>
                                <p>“The Argentine Government has the firm intention of leaving them
                                    without effect as soon as the causes which have given origin to
                                    them disappear.</p>
                                <p>“The Argentine Government is disposed to grant to the United
                                    States the same treatment as that accorded to the countries
                                    which have signed commercial agreements with Argentine and in
                                    the measure that may be permitted by the availability of
                                    exchange produced by the sale of Argentine products in the
                                    United States, provided that as a result of the negotiations
                                    which that Government proposes to initiate a régime should come
                                    to be established which would allow in a regular way an adequate
                                    volume of exportation of Argentine products to that country.</p>
                                <p>“The said treatment would come into effect as soon as the
                                    Argentine Government may be in a position to determine the
                                    approximate volume of the sales of Argentine products on the
                                    United States market which would result from the negotiations
                                    proposed by the Government of the United States. Within the
                                    existing régime of control, it is indispensable to determine,
                                    although with a certain anticipation, the volume of exports in
                                    order to insure the regular and uniform adjudication of
                                    available exchange.</p>
                                <p>“In that sense, it is well to take into account the fact that the
                                    volume of the sales of Argentine products recently attained in
                                    the United States may be considered as extraordinary and of an
                                    irregular character and that it would be necessary that the said
                                    products should be the object, on the part of the Government of
                                    the United States, of a better treatment than the present in
                                    customs matters and administrative regulations, so that the said
                                    volume may be maintained in a regular and permanent way.”</p>

                        <p>In case this memorandum should allow of making the preliminary
                            announcement, this Chancellery deems that it would be well that the said
                            announcement should be made simultaneously and in the same terms at
                            Buenos Aires and at Washington.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Sayre referred to the Argentine Government’s memorandum dated
                            December 30, 1937, (copy attached)<note n="20" xml:id="d235fn20"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> and said that we are not <pb
                                n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0243"/>clear as to what is meant by
                            it. He said that our proposal had been to make our preliminary
                            announcement of contemplated negotiations as soon as we had received
                            assurances from the Argentine Government that the latter would abolish
                            its exchange discriminations against the United States on the date of
                            the formal notice of intention to negotiate. He pointed out that the
                            Argentine memorandum referred to does not indicate whether or not the
                            Argentine Government is prepared to give these assurances.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that it is necessary before removing the exchange
                            discrimination to estimate the probable amount of Argentine exports to
                            the United States which would result from the agreement—not exact
                            figures, of course, but a general estimate. He said the Argentine
                            Government was not trying to trade the removal of the exchange
                            discrimination for tariff concessions by this country. In other words,
                            there is no desire on Argentina’s part to use the exchange
                            discriminations as a bargaining point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre replied that he was very glad to be assured of this because the
                            point of principle involved is an important one; that it is a definite
                            part of our policy not to grant tariff concessions in return for the
                            mere removal of discriminations. He said that when the Trade Agreements
                            Act was under consideration in Congress, the question was raised whether
                            it would not cause other governments to take action against American
                            trade in order to create something to offer in return for tariff
                            concessions here; that the effect of this would be merely to bring about
                            reductions in the American tariff without any net gain for the benefit
                            of American exports. Mr. Sayre said that he had assured the
                            Congressional committees that no such situation would be permitted to
                            develop. Hence it is absolutely necessary that we adhere to our position
                            on this point.</p>
                        <p>In reply the Ambassador again gave positive and definite assurances that
                            the removal of the exchange discrimination would not be used as a
                            bargaining lever to obtain tariff concessions from us; that our
                            concessions to Argentina would be paid for with tariff concessions on
                            American products by Argentina.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre then referred to the request in the Argentine memorandum for an
                            indication of the nature of concessions which the United States would be
                            in a position to give and pointed out that it would be impossible to
                            foretell what increase in trade would actually result. The Ambassador
                            said that, while the memorandum referred to the need for estimating the
                            increase in the volume of trade which might be anticipated, the idea
                            actually was only to get a general picture of the extent of the
                            concessions contemplated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre then referred to the Argentine memorandum with a view to
                            obtaining a clarification of several points, as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0244"/>
                        <p>With reference to paragraphs 3 and 4, the Ambassador said that the
                            statement that the exchange discriminations were emergency measures
                            necessitated by the treatment of Argentine products by foreign
                            countries, was only inserted for background purposes. It was not to be
                            construed as meaning that the discriminations will be removed only when
                            the American tariff on Argentine products had been reduced.</p>
                        <p>In regard to paragraph 5, the Ambassador explained that the reference to
                            the availability of exchange resulting from the sale of Argentine
                            products in the United States was not intended to imply that the
                            trade-agreement negotiations would in any sense be on a basis of
                            bilateral balancing; that there was no intent whatever to seek a balance
                            of exports and imports of Argentina’s trade with the United States.</p>
                        <p>With reference to paragraph 7, the Ambassador said that the reference to
                            the need of maintaining the volume of Argentine imports into the United
                            States through duty reductions on our part did not mean that the
                            concessions by the United States must be such as to permit imports to be
                            maintained at recent abnormal levels, nor that any specific guarantee
                            would be sought that any given volume of imports would result from the
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>With reference to our proposal that Argentina give us definite assurances
                            prior to the issuance of the preliminary announcement that the exchange
                            discrimination would be removed when the formal announcement is made,
                            the Ambassador urged that we give to him an indication of the extent of
                            the concessions which we might grant before such assurances were given
                            by Argentina. After extended discussion, it was agreed that if a
                            tentative schedule of concessions were given now, it might lead to
                            detailed discussions of the concessions requested, amounting virtually
                            to negotiations, and thus might defer for a considerable period of time
                            the issuance of the preliminary announcement. This would be extremely
                            unfortunate in view of the pressure of time. It was pointed out that if
                            Argentina should give us the assurances regarding the removal of
                            discriminations at the time of the formal announcement and if the
                            preliminary announcement were immediately made, discussions of the
                            schedules could then go forward and Argentina would then be in a
                            position to get an idea of the probable extent of the concessions to be
                            offered by the United States. If it were dissatisfied, the formal
                            announcement could be held up and along with it the obligation to remove
                            the discrimination. The Ambassador finally agreed to recommend definite
                            acceptance of our proposal and prepared the attached draft telegram<note

                            drafted along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>My Government has instructed me to request the earnest
                                    consideration of your Excellency, and of the interested
                                    authorities in the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank of the
                                    Argentine Republic, of the possibility of allowing American
                                    trade full equality of treatment in exchange matters. It is
                                    believed that your Excellency will recognize that
                                    reconsideration of the position of your Government in this
                                    regard is particularly opportune in view of recent economic
                                    developments.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States has noted with gratification
                                    the greatly increased prosperity which the Republic of Argentina
                                    has been enjoying during recent months, and feels that this
                                    encouraging development is of international significance in
                                    accelerating the general progress of world recovery. It is noted
                                    that the higher prices and great volume of Argentine exports
                                    have contributed, with other factors, to an appreciable
                                    strengthening of the Argentine peso. The reported prospects seem
                                    excellent.</p>
                                <p>If our understanding is correct, foreign exchange has become
                                    available in amounts which made it possible for the Argentine
                                    Government to make special payments abroad which involved large
                                    outlays of foreign exchange by the Argentine Government, such as
                                    the repayment of foreign loans. Furthermore, the refunding at
                                    lower interest rates of much of the rest of the Argentine
                                    foreign debt, which is now being achieved in the United States
                                    as well as elsewhere, should lessen the demand on foreign
                                    exchange availabilities for foreign loan service. Despite these
                                    developments and the impression that my Government received that
                                    greater amounts have become available for the payments of
                                    imports of merchandise, severe and discriminatory exchange
                                    handicaps against American trade remain operative. The
                                    circumstances outlined make it difficult for my Government to
                                    understand the necessity for this inequality, which is contrary
                                    to the policies unanimously approved at the Conference of

                                <p>It will be recalled that in June 1936 the Argentine exchange
                                    control authority broadened the list of American commodities
                                    entitled to exchange at the official rate. The announcement at
                                    this time of further action by the Argentine Government towards
                                    the complete abolition of exchange discrimination against the
                                    United States would have a favorable effect on public opinion in
                                    the United States and strengthen still further the traditional
                                    bonds of commerce and friendship between the two countries.</p>

                        <p>16. I delivered yesterday to the Minister of Foreign Affairs a note
                            substantially following the draft indicated in the Department’s 15,
                            February 2, 2 p.m., except for an addition to the effect that by
                            exchange matters my Government refers obviously not only to exchange
                            control but also to the 20 per cent surcharge. The Minister promised to
                            give the note prompt consideration.</p>
                        <p>With his approval I also handed a copy to the Minister of Finance.<note
                                n="26" xml:id="d237fn26">Roberto M. Ortiz.</note> On reading it the
                            latter reiterated his recent statements to me, namely: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That although there is a possibility of the abolition of
                                    exchange control there is no immediate prospect of this.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That abolition of exchange control would not entail the
                                    abolition of the 20 per cent surcharge on goods not receiving
                                    previous import permits and that this latter system must be
                                    retained to secure a measure of control over imports.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That it is the policy of the Argentine Government to grant as
                                    much official exchange as is created by the purchase of
                                    Argentine goods and that this rule was being applied impartially
                                    to all countries.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I emphasized with the Finance Minister the importance of public opinion
                            in the United States, as set forth in the Department’s concluding
                            paragraph. In this connection I also told him that I hardly thought my
                            Government would admit the 20 per cent surcharge as a bargaining point
                            in any trade agreement discussions. The Minister promised to discuss at
                            once with the Foreign Office the note I gave him and to send me a
                            memorandum at an early date.</p>
                        <p>I have also been recently pressing the Minister for an extension of the
                            list of commodities granted official exchange; this he intimates is
                            contingent upon negotiations for a trade agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>Figures for 1936 showing the amount of official exchange allowed the
                            United States (1) for exports to Argentina and (2) for debt and other
                            services are promised within a fortnight by exchange control office.</p>
                        <p>While I am doing my utmost to secure the abolition of exchange control
                            and the elimination of other discriminations against our trade, it is my
                            impression that Argentina will insist upon substantial concessions from
                            us before any favorable action will be taken, due among other things to
                            the protective character of the 20 per cent surcharge as regards British
                            exports to this country. Possibly Argentina might be more lenient if
                            there was some assurance that the British Government would not insist
                            upon a too strict interpretation of the Anglo-Argentine trade

                        <p>21. Department’s telegram No. 20, February 8, 2 p.m. Article 9 of the
                            Anglo-Argentine agreement gives the right to either party to abrogate
                            the agreement should either Government take any measure “liable to upset
                            the equilibrium resulting from this agreement”. This equilibrium is
                            interpreted as meaning the allocation of sterling exchange in accordance
                            with article 4 paragraph 1 of the agreement <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238"
                                facs="0248"/>which presupposes that all British exports to Argentina
                            will receive exchange at the official rate. Argentina during the past
                            few years has had a favorable balance of trade with Great Britain with
                            an approximate ratio of more than 2 to 1. While it is difficult to
                            estimate even roughly how much British trade would suffer with the
                            removal of 20 per cent surcharge, there is no doubt that it is of
                            material assistance to British exports. When the 20 per cent surcharge
                            was voluntarily imposed by the Argentines they made it clear that one of
                            its principal purposes was to favor Great Britain in a policy of
                            bilateral trade.</p>
                        <p>It might be that in conversations with us relating to the conclusion of a
                            trade agreement, Great Britain might be willing to forego a strict
                            allocation of sterling exchange provided under article 4 and might also
                            be willing to favor the discontinuance of the 20 per cent surcharge.
                            Such assurances by the British Government would take from the Argentines
                            one of their principal arguments for the maintenance of the surcharge. I
                            believe, however, that it would require either such assurances on the
                            part of Great Britain or else substantial trade concessions from us
                            before the Argentines would even consider relinquishing the 20 per cent
                            surcharge which has become such an important and integral part of their
                            present trade policy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that in the
                            course of an informal conversation held recently, Dr. Louro, head of the
                            Exchange Control Board, informed Consul Ravndal in strict confidence
                            that the Minister <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0249"/>of Finance
                            had forwarded to him for comment the Embassy’s note of February 3,
                                1937.<note n="29" xml:id="d241fn29">For substance of this note, see
                                telegram No. 15, February 2, 2 p.m., to the Ambassador in Argentina,
                                    <ref target="#pg_235">p. 235</ref>.</note> Dr. Louro stated that
                            prior to receiving the Embassy’s note he had submitted a detailed report
                            to the Finance Minister recommending that several articles be taken off
                            the list of American commodities entitled to official exchange. He added
                            that lie had pointed out to the Finance Minister that during the past
                            few months the number of applications for prior permits to purchase
                            dollar exchange at the official rate had grown to such proportions that
                            it would be dangerous to maintain the list of preferred articles at its
                            present scope. He advised the Minister that while prospects for 1937 are
                            bright, 1938 might prove to be a bad year and that, therefore, it would
                            be wise to utilize the present to build up a substantial reserve fund to
                            protect the country’s finances in periods of adversity. Dr. Louro
                            declared that he is therefore going to recommend to the Finance Minister
                            with reference to the Embassy’s note that the Finance Minister reply to
                            the Embassy that the Argentine Government regrets not only that it
                            cannot comply with the wishes of the United States Government but also
                            that it must reduce the number of articles which hereafter will be
                            considered as entitled to official dollar exchange pending the
                            negotiation of a trade agreement with the United States.<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d241fn30">See <ref target="#pg_213">pp. 213</ref> ff.</note>
                            Dr. Louro is drawing up a list of American commodities which he feels
                            should be taken off the preferred list. He expressed the belief that the
                            Minister would agree with his recommendations.</p>
                        <p>He stressed that the projected reduction of the preferred list is not
                            designed to bring pressure towards ratification of the Sanitary
                            Convention and the announcement of trade agreement negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I am endeavoring to obtain discreetly further information on this subject
                            and expect to see the Minister shortly.</p>

                                printed.</note> A personal letter which I addressed to the Minister

                            appears obvious to me that both he and Louro, head of the Exchange

                            the question of removing exchange discrimination either entirely or
                            partially. A few days ago Louro told Ravn-dal<note n="33"

                            not only to incomplete statistics for 1936 (see my telegram 45, April 2,
                            5 p.m.) [but] also to the desirability of waiting for the prospects for
                            creation of official marginal exchange during 1937.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the Argentine authorities are attempting in this manner to
                            force us to negotiate this subject with them as a part of the
                            contemplated trade agreement and that the only way now to secure better
                            exchange treatment would be to inform Saavedra Lamas and the Finance
                            Minister and interested officials of the Foreign <pb n="241"

                            a removal of exchange discrimination would secure much needed support in

                            a continuance of the present exchange treatment would seriously hamper

                        <p>71. Yesterday afternoon, at the suggestion of the Minister of Finance, I
                            saw Louro, Chief of Exchange Control Board, with reference to
                            Department’s note of February 3. At outset Louro stated that Espil’s
                            speech at New York on May 19 set forth exactly the Argentine
                            Government’s viewpoint. Louro emphasized that although the Argentine
                            authorities recognized the favorable balance of trade with the United
                            States they considered this of relatively minor importance and were of
                            the opinion that any concessions towards relaxation of exchange control
                            must be based on the conclusion of a treaty. I gathered that it is
                            Argentina’s present policy to assure stable markets for her primary
                            products through the conclusion of treaties with consuming nations and
                            that such countries thereby obtain preferential exchange treatment. He
                            added that if the United States should conclude such a treaty the
                            question of exchange discrimination would be automatically solved.</p>
                        <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0252"/>
                        <p>I repeated to Louro pertinent portions of the note of February 3 and
                            inquired when an answer could be expected. I referred to the
                            desirability of an extension of the list of American imports now
                            entitled to official exchange pointing out that American exporters are
                            resentful of the discrimination to which they are being subjected and
                            indicating that more liberal treatment in this respect would improve
                            sentiment in the United States towards a possible trade agreement and
                            commercial relations in general. In conclusion Louro explained to me
                            that the reply to our note of February 3 depends upon the Minister who
                            has been very busy with the preparation of the budget for 1938. I
                            expressed the hope of an early answer. He said that he would convey my
                            remarks to the Minister.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my telegram No. 71 of
                            May 21, 11 a.m., I have the honor to state that on May 19 Mr. Clark, the
                            Commercial Attaché, and I saw Mr. Louro the Chief of the Exchange
                            Control Board. This visit was made in pursuance of a suggestion from the
                            Minister of Finance in reply to a letter which I addressed to him on May
                            13 stating that inasmuch as I had received no reply to my written
                            request of May 5 for an interview, the Minister might, in view of his
                            numerous engagements, find it more convenient for me to see some person
                            in his Ministry authorized to discuss the subject of exchange. In
                            designating Mr. Louro as the person whom I should see, the Minister
                            stated that he would be willing to see me at a subsequent date.</p>
                        <p>As stated in my aforementioned telegram, Mr. Louro did not indicate
                            definitely when the Argentine Government would answer the Department’s
                            note of February 3, saying that this depends on the Finance Minister. He
                            spent considerable time defending the Argentine viewpoint on the subject
                            of granting official exchange to American importers, the substance of
                            his argument being that Argentina, since it is a producer of raw
                            materials subject to the vicissitudes of climate, markets and prices
                            which do not affect manufactured goods, must protect the former by means
                            of bilateral commercial agreements in which special exchange treatment
                            is granted by Argentina. In view of these agreements it was impossible
                            to accord similar treatment to countries with which no such conventions
                            had been concluded. He referred with evident chagrin to the delay which
                            has occurred in the <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0253"

                            expressed his appreciation of the Secretary’s efforts, and dismissed as
                            commercially unimportant the unconditional most-favored-nation treatment
                            accorded to Argentina by the various bilateral trade agreements recently
                            entered into by the United States.</p>
                        <p>During the conversation I referred specifically to the argument set forth
                            in the note of February 3 and the Department’s telegram No. 34 of April
                            24, pointing out that I have been informed by my Government that much
                            resentment is prevalent among American importers owing to the exchange
                            discrimination to which they are being subjected. I gave him a list of
                            leading American articles of import which do not receive official
                            exchange and stated that I hoped this information would be helpful to
                            the Argentine authorities should they conclude to extend the list
                            compiled last year, adding that if more liberal treatment were granted,
                            the resentment to which the Department referred would very probably be
                            lessened and that this result would tend to be beneficial in the event
                            conversations looking to the conclusion of a trade agreement should be
                            initiated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Louro then asked whether he should understand by this that a
                            commencement of negotiations for a commercial treaty was contemplated,
                            to which Mr. Clark and I replied categorically that he should not. I
                            consider, however, that this inquiry reveals the interest in the subject
                            which prevails among Argentine officials.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday evening I had occasion to discuss informally the subject of
                            trade relations with the Minister of Agriculture. He said that if the
                            Sanitary Convention were not ratified, Argentine interest in a
                            commercial agreement would be greatly lessened, but he did not intimate
                            that Argentina would in such an instance decline to negotiate.
                            Nevertheless it is very definitely apparent that the moral factor
                            inherent in the ratification of the Sanitary Convention looms very large
                            in the Argentine mind.</p>

                        <p>88. My 71, May 21, 11 a.m. In conversation yesterday between a member of
                            the staff and the Under Secretary of Finance, Dr. Louro of Exchange
                            Control Office had prepared a memorandum for the <pb n="244"
                                xml:id="pg_244" facs="0254"/>Minister of Finance on the subject of
                            my interview of May 20. Saenz stated that the Minister, Louro and
                            himself would confer on this memorandum after which the Minister would
                            ask me to see him.</p>
                        <p>During conversation Saenz stated that he was aware of unfortunate
                            impression created in the United States by the exchange discrimination.
                            He thought that without a trade agreement it would be very difficult for
                            Argentina to grant official exchange on all imports owing to the various
                            treaties Argentina has concluded with other countries. He suggested,
                            however, that it might be possible for Argentina to abolish exchange
                            discrimination until the end of the negotiations for a trade agreement,
                            implying thereby that such discrimination would be reestablished if such
                            negotiations are unsuccessful.</p>
                        <p>Owing to political developments here it is probable that Ortiz will soon
                            resign as he is a candidate for the Presidency. I hope, however, that I
                            shall see him before this takes place.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that I was
                            received this afternoon by Dr. Acevedo, the new Minister of Finance,
                            with whom I discussed the discriminatory treatment which Argentina is
                            now according to imports from the United States.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the conversation only the general aspect of the
                            subject was touched upon as Dr. Acevedo stated he had been so busy
                            receiving great many visitors who came to offer him their good wishes
                            that he had been unable to give much time to the actual business of his
                            Ministry. Nevertheless I outlined to him the Embassy’s note of February
                            3rd, emphasizing to him the many complaints that were being received by
                            the Department from American exporters. I said that this discrimination
                            was occasioning an atmosphere not entirely favorable to Argentina and
                            went as far as to express as my own personal opinion that if this
                            discrimination could be entirely removed or if at least the list of
                            articles now receiving official exchange could be augmented the effect
                            which this would have on opinion in the United States would be a happy
                            one and might be helpful if negotiations for a commercial agreement
                            should at any time be undertaken. I requested that if the Argentine
                            Government should not be willing to remove the discrimination entirely
                            it should at least increase the aforementioned list.</p>
                        <p>Our conversation also touched on the trade balances between the two
                            countries. I pointed out to him that for several years Argentina’s <pb
                                n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0255"/>position in this respect had
                            been satisfactory and that in view of the considerable variety of
                            articles which the United States had been purchasing from Argentina it
                            might be expected that the latter’s position would not be as unfavorable
                            as it had been in the past. He acknowledged that the American trade was
                            a desirable one and said that he would like to see a commercial
                            agreement concluded in order to protect Argentine exports to the United
                            States. He made much of the argument, however, that the extraordinarily
                            favorable balance of trade which Argentina is now enjoying had been in
                            existence only during the present year and added that in order correctly
                            to estimate how much official exchange could be given to American
                            imports it would be necessary to ascertain the status of the invisible
                            trade balances. In connection with the latter I reminded him of the
                            greatly reduced debt services which Argentina now had to meet in the
                            United States. He conceded this point but said that he wished to study
                            the matter and that as soon as he had done so he would ask me to see him
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Acevedo and I also discussed the commercial agreements which
                            Argentina had recently been concluding with other countries. He pointed
                            out to me the strictly bilateral character of these agreements as
                            regards exchange and said that, although he favored the multilateral
                            theory of trade advocated by Secretary Hull, Argentina had been forced
                            into concluding bilateral treaties owing to the uncertainty of the trade
                            situation throughout the world. I inquired whether in the event of
                            negotiations with the United States for a commercial agreement the
                            matter of official exchange would form a part of these negotiations. He
                            answered in the affirmative, indicating that the Argentine Government
                            desired to handle this matter as far as the United States is concerned
                            in the same manner as it had done in its agreements with other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Although, as stated above, I was unable to obtain from Dr. Acevedo any
                            statements indicating definitely that relief would be granted to
                            American exporters it has seemed to me advisable to transmit to the
                            Department the leading points of my conversation with him in order to
                            give an indication of his attitude toward the commercial relations
                            between his country and the United States.</p>

                        <p>For Duggan. The Chief of the Argentine Exchange Control Office informed
                            me privately today that the Argentine authorities will reply <pb n="246"
                                xml:id="pg_246" facs="0256"/>to the Embassy’s note of February 3
                            that it cannot grant more official exchange merchandise imports from the
                            United States but in view of the representations of United States “will
                            not for the time being reduce the present scale of allotments for such
                            imports[”]. Allegedly it is doing this “much” in the hope that the
                            United States will soon initiate trade agreement negotiations with
                            Argentina. If such negotiations are not proposed by the United States
                            within a reasonable time allegedly less official exchange than at
                            present will be granted. Letter follows.</p>

                            >15</hi>] of February 2, 1937, 2 p.m., directing me to present to the

                            relative to securing for American trade equality of treatment in
                            exchange matters. It will be recalled that immediately after presenting
                            this note, in accordance with the above instruction, I departed from
                            Argentina on leave.</p>
                        <p>During my absence, as is evident from communications exchanged with the
                            Department, this important subject was carefully pursued by the Embassy,
                            and since my return I have persisted in efforts to obtain some action
                            from the Argentine Government.</p>
                        <p>On August 18 I again discussed the matter with the Minister for Foreign

                            that he would speak to the Minister of Finance on the subject. Following
                            this and after further discussion he telephoned to the Finance Minister
                            in my presence making an appointment for me to see him. In his telephone
                            conversation he pointed out to this official that the application of
                            discriminatory exchange regulations against the United States was
                            calculated to harm commercial relations and urged him to weigh the
                            political aspect of the entire subject.</p>
                        <p>I called the Finance Minister on August 19 and went over the ground with
                            him, emphasizing that the essence of our complaint was against what we
                            considered the discrimination being practiced, which involved <pb
                                n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0257"/>a wrong principle in
                            international commercial relations, the latter a viewpoint which
                            Argentina shared, as evidenced by its attitude at the December
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance, Dr. Acevedo, then said that he wished to
                            emphasize to me that the attitude of his Government toward the United
                            States was most friendly and that the application of the discriminatory
                            features of the exchange regulations ran equally against all countries
                            which did not have some commercial arrangement with Argentina. I
                            countered this by pointing out that the merchants of certain countries
                            with which they had no trade agreement but who were heavy purchasers in
                            the Argentine market had no difficulty in obtaining official exchange.
                            Without attempting exactly to refute this, the Minister remarked that it
                            must be borne in mind that a presidential term was ending, that exchange
                            control in one form or another had lasted for nearly six years, and that
                            it was simply out of the question for the outgoing Administration to
                            strip the incoming Government of measures which the present one was
                            applying and had applied with a degree of success. Speaking further he
                            said that the various restrictive measures which they had taken had been
                            forced on them by world events for which they were in no way
                            responsible.</p>
                        <p>The practical result of my visit was that the Minister asked me to let
                            him have a memorandum of those articles whose importation appeared to be
                            most adversely affected by the application of the twenty per cent,
                            surtax of which I had complained. The request for this information,
                            which in fact had already been given the Finance Ministry some months
                            ago, might at least indicate an intention on the part of the Argentine
                            Government to adopt a more liberal attitude in the granting of official
                            exchange, while maintaining the principle against which my arguments
                            were in large measure directed; but this is only a surmise.</p>
                        <p>The Department will be promptly informed of any further developments in
                            this matter, which, it is assured, is receiving the constant attention
                            of the Embassy.</p>

                        <p>249. Referring to the Consul’s telegram of December 31, 2 a.m., he now
                            informs me that he was informally advised last night by a member of the

                            the Argentine Ambassador in Washington by telephone that the Argentine
                            Government is prepared, immediately following the preliminary
                            announcement of negotiations, to grant complete official exchange
                            coverage for all United States merchandise with the understanding that
                            the trade agreement to be concluded shall provide a reasonable prospect
                            of the creation of a “satisfactory” amount of dollar exchange.</p>

                            beginning of this year reporting the friction between the President,
                            Colonel David Toro, and the Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Colonel
                            Germán Busch; that is, between the older and the younger groups of Army
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>I have been strictly confidentially informed by the La Paz representative
                            of the largest Bolivian mining group that there is a definite agreement
                            between a group of younger officers, headed by Busch, and the National
                            Federation of Ex-Combatants, to oust the present Junta of Government.
                            The agreement provides that General Enrique Peiia-randa, Commander of
                            the Bolivian Army, is to take control of the country in the name of the
                            Army at an opportune time. He is then to inquire of the Army officers
                            who they desire as leader, following which Busch will be called upon to
                            select a provisional government. My informant believes that this move
                            will take place in the course of the next two weeks. It appears that
                            certain mining interests are backing this movement.</p>
                        <p>Another informant confirmed the existence of this coalition, but it is
                            his opinion that Busch prefers to delay matters for a time hoping that
                            some settlement may be arrived at concerning the Chaco.</p>
                        <p>Reference is made to despatch No. 120, dated January 18, 1937,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d255fn2">Not printed.</note> reporting that the Federation
                            of Ex-Combatants had broken up into segments. Recently the ex-combatants
                            have been reorganized under the title of “National Federation of
                            Ex-Combatants”, and have elected Colonel Busch as their supreme chief. A
                            mass meeting of all ex-combatants has been called for July 10th, at
                            which Busch is to publicly assume office.</p>
                        <p>On July 5th Lt. Colonel Busch left La Paz by airplane ostensibly for
                            Concepción, a small village to the north of Santa Cruz, where his <pb
                                n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0260"/>father resides, but most likely
                            to appraise his position in the Oriente and in the Chaco. When his
                            ‘plane was lost for some forty-eight hours, having been forced down by
                            bad weather, a whispering campaign developed in La Paz that probably the
                            Junta of Government had arranged foul play to get rid of him.</p>

                            Monday as previously announced. Rumors persist that he is not being
                            permitted to return and that manifesto replacing Toro by Busch will
                            probably be issued tonight. Repeated to Buenos Aires.<note n="3"

                            for the same duties when Toro resigned there should be no need for a new

                            continued with Busch régime that recognition be accorded at the earliest

                            consider recognition necessary. Have not yet been able to consult with

                            arrival in La Paz on July 24. He is somewhat doubtful whether he will
                            accept. … He will condition acceptance on elections for constitutional
                            government being held by December. However, Alvéstegui believes he will
                            wind up by accepting although he would prefer a more political portfolio
                            than that of Foreign Affairs. [Braden.]</p>

                            some indication as to whether it considers formal recognition of the

                            (1) Toro forcibly deported to Arica yesterday, (2) senior military
                            officers friendly to Toro also being deported, (3) rumors that certain
                            army units are not fully for Busch, (4) student federation last night
                            started march to Palace to petition Busch for return to constitutional
                            government. Military officer met them en route and told them they would
                            be fired upon should they appear before Palace whereupon they disbanded,
                            (5) following banquet at La Paz Club in honor of Peñaranda<note n="7"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            No. 38, dated July 14, 1937, 8 a.m., reporting the resignation of
                            Colonel David Toro R., President of the Military Junta of Government of
                            Bolivia, during the night of July 13th.</p>
                        <p>The resignation of Colonel Toro marks the culmination of the struggle
                            between Colonel Toro and Lt. Colonel Busch, the Chief of the General
                            Staff. It could be seen from the speech delivered by Colonel Busch
                            before the National Federation of Ex-Combatants on July 10th (See
                            despatch No. 272, dated July 12, 1937<note n="9" xml:id="d266fn9">Not
                                printed.</note>), that the existing tension could not last much
                            longer. The ideas expressed in that speech and the rumors which had been
                            circulating in La Paz for some time indicated more or less clearly that
                            Colonel Busch had decided to make a definite break with his chief. With
                            the backing of the ex-service men and the students, as well as the
                            younger army group which has always followed Colonel Busch, the move was
                            accomplished <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0265"/>without incident
                            although somewhat sooner than had first been thought probable.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Toro, accompanied by his family and the Minister of Labor, had
                            left La Paz on July 9th for Urmiri, a health resort some 100 kilometers
                            from the city. It cannot be doubted that he was aware of the fact that
                            an attempt might be made against his government but he apparently did
                            not believe that it would take place at this particular time.</p>
                        <p>As the movement had apparently progressed rapidly during the absence of
                            Colonel Toro and as he did not return, a commission left La Paz for
                            Urmiri on the afternoon of July 13th to demand his resignation. However,
                            before the commission was able to reach him he had returned to La Paz,
                            and he immediately went into consultation with the personnel of the
                            former government. General Peñaranda, the Commander in Chief of the
                            Army, and Colonel Busch both attended this meeting, during which they
                            told Colonel Toro that the army had withdrawn its confidence in him.
                            Their statements were supported by the officers of the La Paz garrison,
                            who had met in the offices of the General Staff and later proceeded to
                            the Palace to announce their stand and their support of Colonel
                            Busch.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after 11 p.m. on the same night two officers attached to Colonel
                            Toro left the Palace and announced that he had resigned. The news of the
                            resignation was immediately communicated to the press and the local
                            radio station and shortly after the announcement was made, several
                            groups of people gathered in the center of the city, but no disorder of
                            any nature has been reported either then or since then.</p>
                        <p>The Legation has been informed that the troops stationed at Viacha, said
                            to have been the most loyal to Colonel Toro during recent months,
                            contemplated entering the city to assist him, but he requested them not
                            to do so. Otherwise there has been no suggestion of trouble, no
                            demonstrations, or any evidence that the majority of the people are
                            either more or less pleased than they were before. The working classes
                            have apparently been apathetic to the entire matter except for a few
                            manifestos of the usual type, denouncing the capitalists.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed a copy of the Spanish text and an English translation
                            of the resignation of Colonel Toro, as well as a copy and translation of
                            the resignation of all the members of the Junta then in La Paz.<note
                                n="10" xml:id="d266fn10">Not printed.</note> Immediately after the
                            resignation telegrams were sent to all the outlying garrisons announcing
                            the resignation of Colonel Toro and recommending that each garrison name
                            the officer who should become head of the government. In the same
                            telegram it was indicated <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0266"/>that
                            the garrison in La Paz had unanimously pronounced itself in favor of
                            Colonel Busch.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the resignation is directed to the army and that
                            Colonel Toro stated that his continuance in office would depend upon the
                            opinion expressed by the army. The resignation also states that as
                            General Peñaranda did not accept the Provisional Presidency, Colonel
                            Toro had turned it over to Colonel Busch.</p>
                        <p>Although a cabinet was announced on July 14th (See Despatch No. 278,
                            dated July 16, 1937<note n="11" xml:id="d266fn11">Not printed.</note>),
                            and took office at 3 p.m. on the same day, Colonel Busch did not

                            until July 15th. The formal announcement of his assumption of office was
                            made through a decree signed by the new President. A copy and
                            translation of this decree is enclosed.<note n="11" xml:id="d266fn12"

                        <p>56. For Braden. Inasmuch as the change of government in Bolivia was
                            effected by a <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> without any semblance
                            of conformity to the constitution, the Department believes that
                            recognition is necessary. The Busch régime has already given evidence of
                            its desire to honor its international engagements. Upon receipt of
                            information that the Busch régime is maintaining public order and is
                            effectively administering the Government, and after consultation with
                            the other governments represented upon the Chaco Committee, this
                            Government will probably proceed at once to give consideration to
                            according recognition.</p>

                            superficially tranquil but undercurrent increasingly tense and

                            resentment and disgust at Busch and his young officers being too ready
                            to use triggers.</p>
                        <p>There have been numerous arrests and deportations including that of
                            Secretary General of Ex-Combatants.</p>

                        <p>Rumors of lack of army solidarity also causing uneasiness. Feeling is

                        <p>The Minister of Bolivia called to see me this morning and read to me the
                            declaration of his Government which he had been instructed to
                            communicate to me. The text of the declaration was identical with that
                            which had been issued by the Bolivian Government to the press, and
                            contained the assurance that Bolivia would scrupulously maintain all of
                            its international obligations and that it desired to continue its
                            friendly relations with the Government of the United States. Further by
                            instruction, the Minister stated that, in the opinion of his Government,
                            no formal act of recognition was required of the new régime. Inasmuch as
                            the government headed by Colonel Toro was a government of the Army and
                            inasmuch as the Army had now <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0269"
                            />merely replaced one officer with another, the régime continued
                            although the individuals in the government were changed.</p>
                        <p>I requested the Minister to say, in reply, that following the useful and
                            desirable precedent created when the Chaco Peace Conference was
                            constituted, it was the desire of this Government to maintain close
                            contact with the other governments represented on the Chaco Peace
                            Conference, and, for that reason, with regard to the statements now
                            advanced by the Government of Bolivia, we were exchanging views with the
                            governments of the mediatory powers, believing that in that way we could
                            more usefully serve in a friendly manner the best interests of the
                            people of Bolivia and Paraguay. I also asked the Minister to say that
                            this Government would, of course, desire a little time, in accordance
                            with its traditional policy, to ascertain whether the present government
                            enjoyed a substantial measure of popular support and likewise was
                            enabled to carry out the ordinary functions of government. I asked him,
                            in conclusion, to emphasize the desire of this Government always to
                            maintain the most friendly relations with all Bolivian governments, and
                            said that I trusted that conditions in Bolivia would soon crystallize in
                            such a way as to make possible the continuation of formal and official
                            friendly relations. The Minister said that he thoroughly appreciated our
                            position and that he would see that this statement was communicated in
                            the proper manner to his Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said, of his own accord, that it was obvious that the change
                            of government had not taken place in quite so tranquil a manner nor with
                            such military precision as that indicated by the instruction from his
                            Government. He had received word of the deaths of three civilians, which
                            had occurred upon the occasion of the banquet for General Peñaranda, and
                            apparently also of the fact that there was considerable tension within
                            the Bolivian Army itself. He said, however, that it was a hopeful sign
                            that the three civilian members of the Cabinet were not purely civilians
                            appointed as individuals, but that in each case the new civilian Cabinet
                            members represented very large political groups. He said that Señor
                            Gutierrez was formerly a member of the Liberal Party and represented the
                            Right Wing of the present Liberal Party, whereas Dr. Baldivieso,
                            designated as Minister of Foreign Affairs, represented the Socialists, a
                            younger political element, and Señor Gonsalvez was, of course, the
                            representative of the Saavedra group. Another encouraging sign, the
                            Minister said, was that Colonel Busch had publicly stated that all of
                            the political parties would be offered full opportunity for organization
                            with a view to proceeding to elections at an early date. He said that
                            this, of course, was completely contrary to the tendency of Colonel
                            Toro’s government, which had been to indefinitely postpone any popular
                            elections.</p>
                        <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>I told the Minister that as soon as our exchanges of views with the other
                            mediatory powers had been concluded, I was sure that we would reach a
                            prompt decision, and that I would be happy to ask him to come to see me
                            as soon as this Government’s attitude had been determined.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: Mr. Huneeus<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d272fn13">Sergio Huneeus, Chilean Counselor of
                                Embassy.</note> came in at the request of the Chilean Ambassador,
                            who is out of town. Mr. Huneeus stated that the Ambassador has received
                            a telegram from the Foreign Office regarding the Bolivian revolution and
                            its effect upon the Chaco situation. Mr. Huneeus said that the telegram,
                            after referring to that part of the manifesto of Colonel Busch which
                            referred to the intention of his Government to honor its international
                            engagements, stated that it would be desirable to have this attitude of
                            the Bolivian Government reiterated by the Foreign Office. The
                            Ambassador’s instructions point out that the note to the foreign
                            governments requesting recognition did not refer to the intention of
                            Bolivia to respect its international commitments. Therefore, the Chilean
                            Foreign Office directed the Ambassador to inquire whether it would not
                            be a good idea for the several mediatory countries to approach the
                            Bolivian Government to secure a reiteration by the Bolivian Foreign
                            Office of the statement made by Colonel Busch.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Huneeus that of course this Government desired to cooperate
                            with the Chilean Government in every appropriate way, but I pointed out
                            that, according to a telegram received from our Legation in La Paz, Peru
                            has already recognized the Busch régime, and Brazil has the intention of
                            doing so today. Under these circumstances I pointed out that it would
                            not be possible for the mediatory powers to present a united point of
                            view. I then went on to say that the statement of Colonel Busch had
                            seemed to the Department to be clear and explicit, and expressed my own
                            belief that it could be taken as the expression of the opinion of the
                            new régime without any necessity for its reiteration by the Bolivian
                            Foreign Office. The Busch statement reads as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“1. The new Government will continue the traditional policy of
                                    peace, giving strict and permanent fulfillment to the
                                    international treaties in force.”</p>

                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0271"/>
                        <p>Mr. Huneeus stated that he thought the considerations I had expressed
                            would be of interest to the Ambassador, but said that he knew the
                            Ambassador would also appreciate learning your views, which I shall be
                            glad to communicate to Mr. Huneeus.</p>

                            respect to the note from the Bolivian Acting Foreign Minister and with
                            respect to the desirability of recognizing the new Bolivian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In the ensuing discussions you may state that it is the opinion of this
                            Government that the statement issued by Colonel Busch at the time he
                            assumed office, which has been reiterated by the Bolivian Minister here,
                            fully covers the Bolivian intention to respect its international
                            obligations, which would cover the Chaco protocols. Please make inquiry,
                            however, as to the Minister’s opinion with regard to the stability of
                            the new Government, its composition and authority, and the measure of
                            popular support which it would seem to possess.</p>
                        <p>A somewhat similar instruction is being sent to the missions at Buenos

                        <p>104. From Braden. My 99 July 15, 3 p.m. The Brazilian delegate and I had
                            a very satisfactory 4–hour talk today with Bolivian Ministers of Foreign
                            Affairs and of Mines and Petroleum. Baldivieso <pb n="263"
                                xml:id="pg_263" facs="0273"/>appears pacifistic and reasonable on
                            the Chaco and should be helpful if as now appears likely he accepts the
                            portfolio offered him.</p>
                        <p>Standard Oil Company confiscation was discussed at length and both
                            incoming Ministers agreed to the recommendations which I made in a
                            purely personal capacity, viz: (1), that the matter be referred to a
                            commission of reputable citizens in order to at least tide over the
                            present strong public opinion favoring confiscation; (2), to encourage
                            foreign capital investment Bolivia must make some deal with Standard Oil
                            Company perhaps along the lines followed by Chile with the American and
                            Foreign Power Company.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian delegate supported my recommendations and deprecated
                            permitting Argentina to build a railroad from Yacuiba to Santa Cruz.
                            With me, he argued in favor of a railroad from Santa Cruz to Puerto
                            Suarez as the more logical economically and preferable from the
                            standpoint of a favorable Chaco settlement of the port question. Your
                            56, July 17, 4 p.m. Bolivian delegate has presented note to Secretariat
                            pledging faith in Conference compliance international commitments and
                            expecting continuance of negotiations. At session this afternoon I
                            stated the Department’s views. Due to Peruvian acknowledgment of
                            Bolivian note simultaneous action by other mediatory nations was not
                            considered desirable. Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs stated he
                            will telegraph Bolivian Government probably within 24 hours employing
                            word “recognition”. Brazilian, Uruguayan and Chilean delegates expect
                            their Governments promptly either to pursue Peruvian [course?] or ours.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit the following
                            brief observations on the causes of the overthrow of the Toro Government
                            and comments on the character of the new President of the Military Junta
                            of Government, Lt. Colonel Germán Busch.</p>
                        <p>Toro had lost the support of the larger mining interests, which opposed
                            the continuance of the large war-time exchange exactions. The miners
                            also were disgusted with his professions of socialism and the
                            disruptions in labor ranks brought about by the numerous confusing and
                            onerous labor decrees. The mining interests became increasingly critical
                            of what the Toro Government was doing with over three hundred thousand
                            pounds sterling monthly that the Government was taking from them by
                            exchange requisition alone.</p>
                        <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0274"/>
                        <p>Toro had aroused the opposition of all “politicos” through his
                            abolishment of political parties, the arrest or deportation of all
                            civilians who dared criticise him, his strict censorship, and his
                            refusal to return to a constitutional régime.</p>
                        <p>Toro had also failed to maintain the support of labor. At the beginning
                            of his administration, labor was encouraged by the Government’s numerous
                            professions of socialism and the emission of numerous social decrees.
                            Most of these social decrees were so confusing and impracticable that it
                            took labor a long time to realize that in spite of all these decrees
                            wages were not materially increased and were nowhere commensurate with
                            the mounting cost of living.</p>
                        <p>Toro never did have the respect and admiration of the young Army
                            officers, whose idol was Busch. At first Toro was classed as a sort of
                            go-between of the younger and older militarists, but as he more and more
                            lined up with the oldsters the youngsters accused him of favoring the
                            older officers and civilians, and leaving them without remunerative
                            posts.</p>
                        <p>The students, in addition to disliking a military rule as such, detested
                            Toro for his part in the 1930 student massacre.<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d276fn20">See <ref target="frus1930v01#pg_415"><hi

                                        rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, pp. 415</ref> ff.</note></p>
                        <p>Toro, therefore, towards the end of his régime, had no organized backing
                            whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Germán Busch, son of a Germán father and a Cruceñan mother, has the
                            single-purpose, Teutonic mentality. He has had the unqualified
                            admiration of the rank and file of the Army and of the younger Army
                            officers because of his unparalleled Chaco war record. Recently, he has
                            also attained the backing of the ex-combatants and of the Federation of
                            University Students, although recent events indicate that the support of
                            the two latter organizations was gained probably more through their
                            desire to eliminate Toro than actually to put Busch at the head of
                            another military Junta. The miners also preferred to take a chance on
                            the uncertainty of a Busch régime than to continue being stifled by
                            Toro.</p>
                        <p>Busch’s sincerity of purpose and his accentuated patriotism … cannot be
                            questioned. Having been primarily instrumental in eliminating President
                            Salamanca in November, 1934, and Tejada Sorzano in May, 1936, he, in the
                            name of the Army, was responsible for putting Toro into office. Toro in
                            office, having failed the Army and the Nation, it was a natural reaction
                            of Busch that he should also be eliminated. Fired by his own ambition,
                            and that of his enthusiastic supporters, it was a foregone conclusion
                            that he would replace Toro.</p>
                        <p>As just stated, Busch’s sincerity and patriotism is evident. Should <pb
                                n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0275"/>he succeed in carrying out his
                            declared intention of giving the country a constitutional government so
                            soon as practicable, he would be an unqualified patriot. But his brash
                            courage, scepticism of everyone about him and political ineptitude, may
                            thwart him; particularly in view of the confused political maelstrom
                            surrounding him and the difficulty of satisfying the appetites of his
                            youthful cohorts.</p>

                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs the latter stated that he did not
                            consider it advisable or necessary to extend formal recognition to the
                            new Bolivian Government, but he considered it preferable to maintain
                            normal diplomatic relations with that Government on the theory that it
                            is merely a prolongation of the previous régime. He added that his views
                            are shared by the Governments of Chile and Peru, as well as by the
                            representatives of the Chaco Conference at Buenos Aires. However, he is
                            informed that the Argentine Government is considering extending formal
                            recognition to the new Bolivian Government within a few days. He
                            explained that he had received formal assurances from the Bolivian
                            Minister here similar to those received by the Department to the effect
                            that the new Bolivian Government intends to respect its international
                            obligations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that his
                            information regarding the stability and authority and popular support of
                            the new Bolivian Government is somewhat conflicting and he is not
                            prepared to state at present that he considers that Government to
                            possess the unanimous support of the Bolivian Army. I inquired whether
                            he believed that the Bolivian Government itself would be satisfied with
                            maintaining relations with other governments without a formal act of
                            recognition and he answered that he had received assurances through the
                            Bolivian Minister that that Government would be entirely satisfied with
                            this arrangement. He explained, furthermore, that he considers the
                            situation to be somewhat different from the cases of recognition of the
                            present Government in Paraguay and the Toro Government in Bolivia since
                            both of those Governments were military governments resulting directly
                            from the overthrow through revolution of civilian governments; that he
                            considers that the present Government of Bolivia is on the other hand
                            merely an ascension to power of a military officer succeeding another
                            military officer and this point, in addition to his lack of certainty
                            regarding the stability of the present Government, strengthens his
                            opinion regarding the desirability merely of maintaining relations with
                            the new Government in Bolivia without any formal act of recognition.</p>

                        <p>105. I today communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the
                            pertinent portions of the Department’s telegram No. 57 of July 19, 7
                            p.m.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the precedent created in the case of the recognition of the
                            present Government in Paraguay, he said that this in a sense tended to
                            force the hand of interested governments in considering recognition of
                            the new Bolivian Government. However, in view of all the circumstances,
                            recognition of the latter by his Government would follow in the next 3
                            or 4 days; he added that recognition should not be accorded
                            automatically as the action of Peru would seem to imply, as the Bolivian
                            Army is not the country.</p>
                        <p>As Argentina has no diplomatic representative at present in La Paz, no
                            such note as received by us has been sent to his Government but the
                            Bolivian Minister here had written in much broader terms asserting the
                            intention of his Government to observe the Chaco protocols; these latter
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasized as being of primary
                            importance. The Argentine Minister considers the pledges made by that
                                [<hi rend="italic">the?</hi>] Bolivian Minister on behalf of his
                            Government as adequate in the matter of protocols. He said he would send
                            me tomorrow the text of the note which he was addressing to the Bolivian
                            Minister here.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is of the opinion that the new
                            Government is reasonably good and stable and therefore thinks it will
                            survive. He considers the new Foreign Minister a fairly good choice and
                            thinks that the new Government may hope for a reasonable measure of
                            popular support.</p>

                        <p>39. Department’s 30, July 19, 7 p.m. In the absence of the Foreign
                            Minister I communicated this afternoon to the Under Secretary the gist
                            of the instructions.</p>

                        <p>With regard to action by the several mandatory countries Señor
                                Vergara<note n="22" xml:id="d281fn22">Germán Vergara Donoso, Chilean
                                Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</note> said that the receipt
                            yesterday of information from the Chaco Peace Conference at Buenos Aires
                            that the various members were in accord, the Chilean Government
                            instructed its representative at La Paz to hand to the Acting Bolivian
                            Foreign Minister this evening, the 20th instant, a note in the following
                            general sense: “Chile will be glad to continue its official relations
                            with the existing Government as had been maintained with that of Señor
                            Toro, in consideration of the statement by Colonel Busch of the
                            intention of his Government to honor its international obligations”.
                            Vergara continued that Chile does not consider any other formality of
                            recognition necessary but that it is of the opinion that the withholding
                            of this step might weaken the prestige of Colonel Busch and so
                            precipitate a more regrettable situation than now exists.</p>
                        <p>Brazil and Peru have already presented notes to the Bolivian Government
                            on the above lines.</p>
                        <p>Respecting the stability of the present Bolivian Government, Chile
                            regards its future as uncertain. Without question Colonel Busch lacks
                            the support of the army as a whole. Lacking also the character and
                            stability of Señor Toro he is at the same time a courageous and
                            energetic person but capable possibly of rashness in order to overcome
                            opposition. The political situation throughout the country is most
                            involved and the people generally are restless. Señor Vergara sees in
                            this situation a possible resumption of hostilities in the Chaco should
                            dissensions in the army impel the Government to such a measure in order
                            to maintain its predominance. It appears that Colonel Busch has
                            established political relations with former President Saavedra who is
                            now in Chile with the obvious purpose of gaining the support of the
                            latter’s partisans.</p>

                            authorized you to say to the United States Government that if this
                            Government were willing, he desires to suggest that the two Governments
                            undertake without delay to explore the possibilities of the trade
                            between Bolivia and the United States, and particularly the possibility
                            of marketing Bolivian tin directly in the United States, so as to
                            determine if sufficient mutual interest exists to justify the
                            negotiation of a trade agreement between the two countries. It has been
                            noted also that it is your understanding that the Bolivian Minister in
                            Washington is being instructed to confirm the conversation between the
                            Foreign Minister and yourself and that the Foreign Minister has stated
                            that if you could obtain an indication that his suggestion for
                            exploratory conversations would be well received in Washington, he was
                            prepared, on being informed of this indication, to reduce his ideas to a
                            formal written proposal.</p>
                        <p>You are authorized to inform the Minister that the Department will give
                            the most sympathetic consideration to any proposals he may wish to put
                            forward as regards a possible trade agreement, making clear that these,
                            of course, would have to be given consideration in the regular way.</p>
                        <p>For your information it should be stated that the Department feels that
                            the negotiation of a trade agreement with Bolivia would be a matter of
                            considerable difficulty. As you know, it is necessary to confine
                            concessions made by the United States in trade agreements to products of
                            which the other countries concerned are the chief or reasonably
                            important sources of imports into the United States. A preliminary
                            survey made in the Department on this basis reveals that there are no
                            products on which reductions in duty could be granted to Bolivia, and
                            very few products with respect to which the existing treatment could be
                            bound. It would seem that on only one product could a duty binding be
                            given: Brazil nuts, the former duty on which was reduced by 50 percent
                            in connection with the agreement with Brazil. Free list bindings might
                            possibly be granted on antimony ore (although Mexico supplies
                            approximately ten times more than does Bolivia which is a second or
                            third supplier) and on tin ore.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0282"/>
                        <p>You are further authorized to say that this Government is always prepared
                            to consider any arrangement compatible with its general commercial
                            policy that might be worked out in regard to tin. However, as you know,
                            despite continued consideration of this matter, nothing concrete has
                            ever been formulated that appears to be of promising character. At the
                            present time, Bolivia presumably is able to sell all the tin it is
                            producing in the world market and securing the world price therefor.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the Bolivian Minister in Washington calls upon the
                            Department with reference to these matters, he will be informed of the
                            Department’s position as outlined above.</p>

                        <p>9. The Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs has been instructed to
                            discuss the possibility of a tin arrangement and, should his overtures
                            be well-received, to suggest a commission to formulate a plan. The
                            instructions apparently thus far do not contemplate a general trade
                            agreement. I told the Foreign Minister that the Department would
                            consider attentively any suggestion from the Bolivian Government, but
                            that much preliminary work would seem necessary before a commission
                            would be justified. The Foreign Minister said that the instructions
                            covered both these points.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to airmail instruction No.
                            37, of February 26, 1937, and previous correspondence regarding the
                            possibilities of a trade agreement between Bolivia and the United
                            States, I have the honor to report that in an interview at the Foreign
                            Office yesterday the Foreign Minister agreed that it might be difficult
                            to find a basis for a satisfactory trade agreement, and it was that
                            thought which had prompted him to suggest the formation of a commission
                            of investigation.</p>
                        <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0283"/>
                        <p>I took the occasion to inquire if he had any specific proposals in mind
                            as it would appear, in view of the difficulties we both appreciated,
                            that the informal exploratory discussions in Washington would have
                            greater chance of success if both parties had some definite goal in
                            mind. To these observations Dr. Finot remarked that nevertheless his
                            government is of the opinion that by patient investigation some basis
                            for negotiation might be discovered mutually beneficial to trade between
                            the two countries.</p>
                        <p>This inconclusive conversation is but another indication, in my opinion,
                            that the Government of Bolivia has no definite offer or project in view,
                            but, not wishing to overlook any opportunity of improving its trade
                            relations, is hopeful that preliminary conversations in Washington may
                            afford a clue that could be developed into something profitable.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the appointment of a commission reference is made to
                            recent despatches from the Legation regarding the establishment of three
                            commissions to study trade relations and related matters with the
                            governments of the Argentine, Brazil and Chile. In view of the marked
                            rivalry between these three countries for trade predominance in Bolivia
                            it might perhaps be injudicious at this time for the United States to
                            appear to be injecting itself into this triangular competition. It is
                            apparent that while the conclusions of these three commissions may be
                            some time in being formulated, the Bolivian Foreign Office is not
                            equipped with sufficient personnel to give attentive considerations to
                            so many proposals at one time.</p>
                        <p>On March 9, 1937, the London price of tin rose to £301/0/0 per ton, the
                            highest price for many years. The average price during January, 1937,
                            had been £228/3/11, during February £233/17/1 and on the first of March
                            had been £244/10/0. There was thus an increase of £57/10/0 during the
                            first few days of March. The production in Bolivia remains low as only
                            1,755,426 fine kilos (1,728 English tons) were produced during the month
                            of February, but this high price should offer some inducement for
                            increased production in spite of the fact that the Government continues
                            to require the delivery by the miners of a large percentage of their
                            foreign exchange. If sustained for any period the present high price
                            will undoubtedly affect Bolivia’s desire for a tin agreement with the
                            United States since it can find a ready market in England for its entire
                            present production and under the quota agreement can market at least
                            twice the present production if it is mined. The only present difficulty
                            is that the Government must convince the miners that it would be to
                            their advantage to increase the production by granting some decrease in
                            the amount of foreign exchange which must be turned over to the
                            Government.</p>
                        <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>Thus, while the desire for a tin agreement in Bolivia is lessened, the
                            interest of the United States as a consuming country is increased since
                            through the manipulations of the Tin Pool the price may be maintained at
                            this high level for some time to the detriment of the American
                            consumers.</p>
                        <p>I should greatly appreciate being kept currently informed of any
                            conversations between the Department and the Bolivian Minister. I feel
                            that I should add that having achieved the principal purpose of the
                            Department’s instruction, namely of having the discussions initiated in
                            Washington rather than in La Paz, there is little further contribution
                            the Legation can make at this juncture except to assist in the general
                            survey of Bolivian economic and financial conditions which is about to
                            be undertaken by Commercial Attaché Merwin L. Bohan, at the suggestion
                            of this mission.</p>

                                printed.</note> prepared by Commercial Attaché Merwin L. Bohan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bohan’s final conclusion is that a reciprocal trade agreement would
                            not result in materially increasing imports from the United States. He
                            points out that Bolivia will never offer a large market for consumers’
                            goods of American manufacture since the import purchasing power of the
                            Bolivian people is exceedingly limited. Although American investments in
                            mining are overshadowed by both Bolivian and Chilean interests, the
                            employment of American executives and engineers is so widespread that
                            the natural preference for American mining equipment and supplies is
                            greatly enhanced and the United States already controls a very
                            substantial percentage of this business. Bolivian import duties are not
                            excessive and exchange restrictions have not substantially affected
                            American exports to Bolivia, and neither one of these two factors is of
                            sufficient importance to warrant treaty negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bohan then concludes that the keen interest of the Bolivian
                            Government in a reciprocal trade agreement arises primarily from <pb
                                n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0285"/>the desire that a smelting
                            industry be established in the United States. Under present conditions
                            practically all Bolivian tin concentrates move to England for smelting,
                            and the man who controls fifty percent of the Bolivian production, Señor
                            Patiño, likewise has heavy interests in the English smelters. On this
                            account, the Bolivian Government is checkmated in dealing with the
                            mining industry and its powers would be substantially increased if the
                            country had more than one outlet for its ores, especially if a smelting
                            industry in the United States were controlled by interests other than
                            those of Simon I. Patiño. He believes that the present balance between
                            the Bolivian Government and the tin industry is much to be preferred to
                            any uncontrolled preponderance on the part of the Government …</p>

                            Government Petroleum Deposits” (Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales
                            Bolivianos or Y. P. F. B.), a government organization for the
                            exploitation and development of the Bolivian petroleum fields.</p>
                        <p>This office has been informed that this organization has been established
                            not only to safeguard the interests of the State in the matter of
                            petroleum production, but is contemplating actively entering the
                            production field. To this end concessions are to be granted for large
                            territories which were formerly surveyed by the Standard Oil Company but
                            which have been relinquished by that company evidently as unproductive.
                            The new organization is apparently of the belief that although these
                            concessions have been returned to the State, they may be productive and
                            worth developing, and that the Standard Oil Company let their
                            concessions lapse simply as a blind.</p>
                        <p>While it is apparent from Article 6 of the enclosed decree that the
                            organization and statutes of the new company are not yet completed, it
                            is understood that as a result of Foreign Minister Finot’s visit to
                            Buenos Aires and the resultant convention with the Argentine <pb n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276" facs="0286"/>(See Legation’s despatch No. 112, dated
                            January 11, 1937<note n="28" xml:id="d292fn28">Not printed.</note>), the
                            Argentine Government through the “Yacimientos Petrolíferos Argentinos”
                            has evinced a more active interest in the Bolivian oil fields and is
                            alleged to have gone so far as to promise that if the Argentine obtains
                            advantages in this matter and the Bolivian Government expropriates the
                            fields held by the Standard Oil Company and allows their purchase by the
                            “Yacimientos Petrolíferos Argentinos”, the Argentine will guarantee that
                            Paraguay will not again go to war with Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>With the economic rivalry of Brazil, Chile and the Argentine, and to a
                            lesser extent Peru, Bolivia is in a position of some advantage and can
                            play off one force against the others. The Brazilian Government has
                            shown considerable interest in obtaining a steady and large supply of
                            Bolivian petroleum sufficient to supply the larger portion of the needs
                            of the country, while the Argentine Government, which is negotiating for
                            the purchase of the Standard Oil properties in that country, is
                            naturally interested in acquiring the Bolivian fields in order that it
                            may have a production monopoly in the southern portion of this
                            continent.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that the Argentine Government has already discussed this
                            subject with the Bolivian Government and that a confidential agent of
                            President Toro will shortly go to Buenos Aires to discuss with the
                            “Yacimientos Petrolíferos Argentinos” the matter of raising capital.
                            Economic penetration of the Argentine through British capital in the
                            railways and oil fields of Bolivia would be an important step in
                            counter-balancing the American influence in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The actual question regarding the production capacity of the Bolivian
                            fields is of course important not only to the Argentine but to almost
                            the same extent to Brazil. While the Brazilian Minister was fairly
                            recently taken on a tour of the oil fields by the Minister of National
                            Defense and the Chief of the General Staff, it is doubtful whether he
                            has any very definite idea regarding production figures or potential
                            production. The Bolivian Government has found it necessary to find some
                            other means of raising capital in the form of foreign exchange since tin
                            production has declined and in spite of government encouragement, has
                            not increased to any great degree. Their alleged riches in petroleum are
                            now receiving considerable attention because of this factor and the bait
                            is being extended to any country which does not remember or prefers not
                            to remember the difficulties of the Standard Oil Company during the
                            recent war.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">La Paz, March 13, 1937</hi>.—Whereas: The documents of
                            the case against the Standard Oil Co. plainly prove the production of
                            petroleum from the Bermejo wells in 1925 and 1926 and its exportation
                            from the territory of the Republic;</p>
                        <p>That in the year 1928 the company mentioned on being required to pay the
                            petroleum exploitation taxes showed by various documents not to have
                            produced petroleum and furthermore, of not being in a position of
                            producing it, since they had evidence to the contrary since the
                            exportation of this product had been authorized from the encampment
                            Bermejo in Bolivia to the Agua Blanca in the Argentina;</p>
                        <p>That (it) ratified its denial of having produced petroleum with the act
                            of not making the required quarterly liquidations in virtue of the
                            contract, manifesting, rather, that there had been no production and
                            therefore there had been no reason (<hi rend="italic">lugar</hi>) for
                            presenting any liquidation.</p>
                        <p>That because of these false statements it avoided the payment of taxes
                            and the delivery of the corresponding royalty to the State defrauding
                            the Government’s interests in a manifest form;</p>
                        <p>That the contract signed with this company on July 27, 1922 is but a
                            clarification of the former contract on the same matter signed in 1920
                            with Richmond Levering and Company since in 1922 it was not possible
                            legally to sign a contract in express contraposition to the Organic
                            Petroleum Law of 1921 and that in view of that the Standard Oil Company
                            explained that it was not a matter of a new one but of substitution of
                            that of the Richmond Levering Company which was (issued) before the law,
                            without rescinding it or leaving it without effect.</p>
                        <p>That the eighteenth clause of the contract of Richmond Levering and
                            Company stipulated that the Government may declare its abrogation or
                            administrative annulment for defrauding the government interests;
                            abrogation which for the capitalists means the loss of all rights to the
                            property which they may have had in the country, which pass to the
                            exclusive property of the State;</p>
                        <p>That until the form in which the State will administer the oil fields and
                            refineries of the Standard Oil Company with all their annexes, fixtures,
                            machinery etc. is defined, they can be used by the Y. P. F. B.;</p>

                        <p>Declare the annulment of all the properties of the Standard Oil Company
                            within the territory of the Republic for proved defrauding of the

                            at the time of dictating the present Resolution pass[es] to the property
                            of the State.</p>

                            which in virtue of this annulment passes to the power of the Government

                        <p>11. Early this evening the offices of the Standard Oil Company were
                            closed and sealed by authority of a resolution of March 13th signed by
                            the entire Junta of Government. I have not yet seen the resolution which
                            is being cabled to New York office but have been informed by the local
                            manager that the order confiscates the entire property of the company
                            and transfers it to the state. The action is based on a claim that the
                            company illegally exported a quantity of petroleum to the Argentine
                            Republic during 1926–1927. The company contends this claim is outlawed
                            by statute. Company’s contract contains Calvo clause<note n="30"

                            the Foreign Minister this morning and was informed that the Government’s
                            action against the Standard Oil Company is based on findings of the
                            Ministry of Mines and Petroleum that a fraud has been committed in
                            illegally exporting oil to the Argentine Republic in 1925–1926; that,
                            however, the most important [factor in?] the Bolivian Government claim
                            is the evasion of taxes amounting to 1,400,000 bolivianos during the
                            early period of exploitation; and that therefore all the properties of
                            the company pass to the state under the fraud provision (article 18) of
                            the Richmond Levering concession of 1920 taken over by the Standard Oil
                            Company. The question of the evasion of taxes has long been before the
                            Supreme Court but by its action the Government has taken the matter into
                            its own hands. The Foreign Minister added that the company would be
                            operated by the official government petroleum agency and on inquiring
                            why it had been [led] to seize the company’s entire property and
                            business to establish its claim he stated that legally the Government
                            has this power and that, in addition to the legal grounds, there is a
                            moral justification arising from the company’s non-cooperative attitude
                            during the Chaco war adding that it was “a natural aspiration of a
                            country to control its petroleum resources.”</p>
                        <p>Apparently concerned that the action of the Government might properly be
                            regarded as an attack on foreign capital, the Foreign Minister stated
                            that he had cabled the Bolivian Minister to try to explain to the
                            Department that it is only an internal matter affecting a Bolivian
                            company.</p>
                        <p>It was plain from his remarks and attitude that the Government is glad to
                            have a pretext to seize the property of the company without necessity of
                            indemnification and irrespective of the relative unimportance of the
                            claim, regards its action as legally justified and well deserved. Before
                            I left he promised me to ask that the company be allowed access to its
                            office and files in order to prepare its defense and I have just been
                            informed that this has been granted.</p>
                        <p>The company’s lawyers advise delay in appealing to the Supreme Court and
                            have petitioned the Junta to reconsider its resolution hopeful that some
                            compromise may be possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that from
                            certain statements made to me, and from other data coming to the
                            attention of the Legation, it would appear that Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs Finot’s foreign policy, particularly as affecting the Standard
                            Oil Company of Bolivia, is motivated by, or based upon, the following
                            premises:</p>
                        <p>Mr. Finot appears to be confident that no effective support for Bolivia’s
                            position in the Chaco Peace Conference<note n="31" xml:id="d296fn31">See
                                    <ref target="#pg_4">pp. 4</ref> ff.</note> can be expected from
                            the United States. He feels that it is evident from the nature of the
                            participation of the United States in the steps taken to avert war in
                            the Chaco and from its attitude during and following that war, the
                            United States prefers not to take issue with the Argentine. While
                            Bolivia has received considerable moral support and sympathy from
                            Brazil, Chile and Peru, no one of these three powers, nor the three
                            jointly, could possibly overcome Argentine influence and thereby offer
                            anything concrete to Bolivia looking towards the settlement of the Chaco
                            question. The only way the present Government can hope to obtain a
                            sufficiently satisfactory settlement of the Chaco controversy that may
                            save its face with the people of Bolivia is, therefore, through a <hi
                                rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> with the Argentine. It would appear
                            that Mr. Finot’s contention is that the most plausible manner of
                            attaining such a <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> would be for
                            Bolivia to accede to the Argentine’s eagerness for access to the
                            Bolivian oil resources. It will be recalled that when the Argentine
                            Carillo mission was in La Paz one of the inducements offered in exchange
                            for Argentine possession of the oil resources was the support of the
                            Argentine Government in readily reaching a satisfactory solution of the
                            long standing critical problem of the Chaco. For its support, I have
                            been informed, the Argentine Government insisted on an agreement direct
                            with the Bolivian Government for full possession of the Bolivian oil
                            resources, the Argentine “Yacimientos Petrolíferos Argentinos” offering
                            the Bolivian Government fourteen percent of the returns therefrom in
                            lieu of the eleven percent under the present Bolivian-Standard Oil
                            contract. Should Bolivia not agree to an Argentine oil concession,
                            Argentina has intimated that it will not be favorably disposed, and
                            Paraguay may eventually be allowed to obtain control of the fields. On
                            the other hand, if Bolivia is willing to grant Argentina a foothold it
                            will see to it that Bolivia does not lose the Chaco or at least any <pb
                                n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0291"/>large part of it. In other
                            words, in making the Standard Oil concessions available to Argentina,
                            such action would guarantee Bolivia a powerful neighbor, who would never
                            again let Paraguay menace its territory. My informant brought to my
                            attention that in discussing this matter with the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs he pointed out to Mr. Finot that by such an arrangement what the
                            Argentine had failed to obtain through the efforts of the Paraguayan
                            Army during the Chaco War, the Argentine would be obtaining
                            diplomatically.</p>
                        <p>If such is Señor Finot’s present reasoning, it seems safe to conclude
                            that some very powerful influence must have forced him to put aside his
                            personal dislike and distrust of the Argentine and Dr. Saavedra
                                Lamas.<note n="32" xml:id="d296fn32">Carlos Saavedra Lamas,
                                Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Argentine

                                Conference.</note> Whatever has happened, present policies are
                            obviously opportunistic, for Bolivia cannot, in the long run, hope to
                            benefit from a program which aims at a special association with one of
                            its neighbors to the disregard of the others, especially when that one
                            country is Argentina.</p>

                            with the Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs and to inform <pb n="282"
                                xml:id="pg_282" facs="0292"/>him that, acting under instructions
                            from your government, you take occasion informally to present the views
                            set forth in the succeeding paragraph.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States regrets to see difficulties arise out
                            of varied interpretations of contracts entered into between
                            American-owned companies operating abroad and the governments of foreign
                            countries. Without expressing an opinion as to the liability of the
                            Standard Oil Company of Bolivia to pay the taxes in question, and
                            without conceding that a failure on its part to pay such taxes as may
                            have been due justified cancellation of the concession, the Government
                            of the United States believes that a scrupulous regard for contractual
                            engagements by all parties concerned therewith is essential for
                            harmonious and mutually advantageous commercial relations. This
                            Government expresses its earnest hope that the present difficulties
                            between the Bolivian Government and the Standard Oil Company of Bolivia
                            will be resolved in a manner equitable to all concerned, through
                            friendly discussions carried on in an atmosphere conducive to a
                            satisfactory adjustment.</p>
                        <p>For your information, Assistant Secretary Welles has discussed this
                            situation twice with the Bolivian Minister here along the general lines

                            receipt of the Department’s telegraphic instruction No. 10, dated April
                            26, 1937, and to report that the views set forth therein were presented
                            orally to the Minister of Foreign Affairs at 5:00 p.m. today. He was
                            also permitted to read a paraphrase of the pertinent paragraph of the
                            telegram.</p>
                        <p>Minister Finot remarked that the least any government could do under the
                            circumstances would be to hope for an equitable settlement. …</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs informed me that there are no discussions
                            pending between the Government and the Company, but that negotiations
                            will undoubtedly be initiated by Dr. Carlos Calvo, <pb n="283"
                                xml:id="pg_283" facs="0293"/>attorney for the Company, upon his
                            arrival in La Paz, scheduled for early in May.</p>
                        <p>Minister Finot, after reading the pertinent part of the Department’s
                            instruction, requested a copy thereof so that he might have a record of
                            the definite terms used by the Department. I have not complied with the
                            Minister’s request, nor shall I do so, unless the Department
                            telegraphically instructs me to do otherwise. I personally feel that
                            this recognition of the controversy is timely and proper. It was not
                            wholly unexpected in view of Guachalla’s<note n="34" xml:id="d299fn34"
                                >Fernando Guachalla, Bolivian Minister in the United States.</note>
                            reports having prepared Finot for some notice on our part. As a first
                            step the oral presentation of the Department’s views served a useful
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me desirable to keep our part informal at this juncture,
                            which was evidently the Department’s intention, at least until
                            negotiations between the Bolivian Government and the Company are more
                            developed. As matters now stand, the United States has given notice of
                            its interest. That should suffice for the present, especially since
                            Minister Finot’s attitude indicates that he is aware of the
                            disadvantages of allowing the Bolivian Government’s action to appear too
                            violent.</p>

                        <p>26. Referring to page 10 of my despatch No. 173, dated March 18,<note

                            question of conflicting interpretations of contracts. The transfer is
                            based on Bolivian concept that Government has administrative right to
                            unilateral action and to this extent limits possibility of a friendly
                            settlement. It would also indicate that Finot’s professed desire for an
                            equitable adjustment is looking to palliate Government’s actions in view
                            of foreign criticism.</p>

                            Standard Oil Company out of Bolivia for political reasons. It will never
                            be allowed to return”. This confirms last sentence my telegram No.

                        <p>14. I have been increasingly disturbed by the situation which is
                            developing with regard to the seizure of the Standard Oil properties and
                            in particular by the information you have telegraphed the Department as
                            to the attitude recently displayed by the Bolivian Government and by Dr.
                            Finot himself which would seem to indicate that the Bolivian Government
                            has no present intention of reaching a fair adjudication of the equities
                            involved in this case, whatever these equities may in fact be.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, I desire to address a personal message to Dr. Finot which I
                            transmit herewith. Please read this message to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, and should he so request, but only in such event, you may leave
                            with him a written copy of this message marked “Personal and
                            confidential: Memorandum of a personal message addressed by the

                            Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bolivia”. Please
                            telegraph me such reply or comment as Dr. Finot may make to you upon
                            receipt of this message.</p>

                                    solely as an expression of my personal concern by reason of the
                                    existence of a situation which may prejudice <pb n="285"

                                    Dr. Finot, like myself, attaches the greatest importance.</p>
                                <p>During these recent years the “good neighbor” policy, as an
                                    inter-American policy, has made tremendous strides. It has no
                                    more able and consistent advocate than Dr. Finot. It
                                    contemplates, of course, a general friendliness, complete faith
                                    of governments and peoples in each other, and a wholehearted
                                    disposition to cooperate each with the other for the promotion
                                    of their mutual interests and mutual welfare. One of its
                                    foundations must, of course, at all times be the recognition and
                                    the practice of fair dealing and fair play on the part of
                                    governments and peoples towards each other. This policy of
                                    equity and reasonable and just treatment cannot by its very
                                    nature be a one-sided policy. It must in its very essence have a
                                    reciprocal character, if the peoples of the New World are to
                                    progress steadily towards a higher level of international
                                    relationships.</p>
                                <p>The series of acts which have recently been undertaken by the
                                    Bolivian Government, involving certain properties of the
                                    Standard Oil Company of Bolivia—a company owned by the Standard
                                    Oil Company of New Jersey of the United States of America—have
                                    created the very widespread impression in the United States and
                                    in other parts of this continent that the Government of Bolivia
                                    has given no overt indication of any intention on its part to
                                    compensate the owners of these properties for their seizure by
                                    the Government of Bolivia, nor that the Government of Bolivia
                                    has manifested any disposition to arbitrate, or otherwise
                                    adjudicate, any rights or equities which may be involved.</p>
                                <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                                <p>It is hardly necessary for me to add that the existence of these
                                    conditions are personally very distressing to me because of my
                                    confidence that both the Government of Bolivia and Dr. Finot
                                    personally are as anxious as we are in Washington to dispel any
                                    misunderstandings which today exist which would prejudice in any
                                    manner mutual confidence between our two peoples and between our
                                    two governments. I expressly refrain from dealing at this time
                                    with any questions of fact or law, but I do very earnestly
                                    desire to urge upon Dr. Finot the expression of my sincere hope
                                    that steps may be taken by the Bolivian Government at an early
                                    opportunity to make it clear that that Government has every
                                    intention of offering just and equitable compensation for the
                                    properties owned by nationals of the United States which may
                                    have been seized by the Bolivian authorities, or, failing an
                                    agreement between these nationals of the United States and the
                                    Government of Bolivia upon the form and amount of such
                                    compensation, that it will agree upon some method of
                                    adjudication of the rights and equities inherent.</p>
                                <p>In conclusion, Dr. Finot may be assured that I shall be happy in
                                    every appropriate and possible manner to cooperate with him with
                                    the hope that through negotiations, conducted in a spirit of
                                    friendship and fair dealing, between the Government of Bolivia
                                    and these nationals of the United States a fair and equitable
                                    settlement may be found.”</p>

                            No. 28, dated May 8, 3 p.m.,<note n="39" xml:id="d303fn39">Not
                                printed.</note> reporting that the personal message addressed by the
                            Secretary of State to His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs of
                            the Republic of Bolivia had been read to Dr. Finot this morning. The
                            message obviously made a good impression on the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs and he immediately requested a copy, expressing a wish to make a
                            written personal reply thereto through this Legation. A copy of the
                            written message as delivered to Dr. Finot is enclosed.<note n="40"
                                xml:id="d303fn40">See <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note></p>
                        <p>That the message made a definite impression on Dr. Finot was obvious from
                            the fact that at the beginning of his conversation his comments were
                            much more guarded and temperate than heretofore. Dr. Finot authorized me
                            to report that he had been designated by President Toro to represent the
                            Junta in discussions with Dr. Carlos Calvo, attorney for the Standard
                            Oil Company of Bolivia, who is scheduled to arrive in La Paz today, and
                            that he is personally disposed to do everything towards seeking a basis
                            for a possible settlement, but that this will be extremely difficult. He
                            continued that the Standard Oil matter had gone too far and that
                            internal political considerations would prevent the Bolivian Government
                            from receding, adding that a plebiscite in the country would well nigh
                            be one hundred per cent for the Government’s action.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Finot embarked upon a long, involved series of comments, the high
                            spots of which are the basis for this report. At the beginning, his
                            statements were cautious, but as he grew expansive it became evident
                            that he was principally interested in justifying the Government’s
                            action. His attitude made apparent that he was the member of the Junta
                            who had instigated the Government’s action, or at least is the principal
                            supporter thereof.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Finot, at the outset of his conversation, stated that we could count
                            on his cooperation to try for a settlement. He realized that the
                            interpretation and the attendant publicity given abroad to the Bolivian
                            Government’s action might be prejudicial to United States-Bolivian
                            relations and particularly to Bolivia’s dire need to attract additional
                            foreign capital; but that Bolivia would simply have to take the
                            consequences of its justifiable action.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Finot again stressed the importance of the incriminating documents
                            found in the Standard Oil safe in La Paz. He has not yet seen <pb
                                n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0297"/>these documents, and stated
                            that he would not form a definite decision thereon until he had time to
                            make a detailed personal study thereof; but that if they are as damaging
                            as reported, he considers the possibility of an adjustment remote.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Finot then brought up the question of the Standard Oil Company’s
                            attitude and activities during the Chaco war. The Company’s war
                            activities are of course the principal basis of the ill will throughout
                            the country directed against the Standard Oil. He reiterated that the
                            Bolivian Government’s action was not only legally and morally justified
                            on account of fraud and the non-cooperative stand taken by the Company
                            during the war, but that it was especially necessary to dispel the
                            impression current throughout the world that the weak and impoverished
                            Bolivia had been merely an instrument of the all-powerful, imperialistic
                            world monster, the Standard Oil Company—that the Chaco war had been
                            fought merely to protect the Standard Oil properties. Finot feels that
                            the Standard Oil should have been driven out of Bolivia then, and stated
                            that he had discussed this with an official of the Department who, at
                            the time, “didn’t reply yes, but didn’t say no.” He added that since the
                            Standard Oil had not been then driven out, the internal political
                            situation makes it essential to eliminate the Standard Oil Company now
                            and that he would be the last person in Bolivia to be willing to see the
                            Standard Oil permitted to re-enter.</p>
                        <p>Finot then commented that the external political situation also made the
                            Government’s action unavoidable. It had been obvious from the beginning
                            of the Chaco controversy that the United States would not take issue
                            thereon with the Argentine. Chile is altogether too weak to stop the
                            Argentine and Brazil is too absorbed with its internal dissensions to
                            thwart Argentine imperialism. The only recourse left to defenseless
                            Bolivia under the circumstances is to placate the Argentine by making
                            available the Bolivian oil resources coveted. He continued that he had
                            discussed this matter of the Argentine dominating the Chaco situation in
                            Washington with Assistant Secretary Welles and later at Buenos Aires had
                            discussed it further with Secretary Hull and Ambassador Braden, but that
                            since the neighboring powers cannot, and the United States will not, do
                            anything, Bolivia simply has to play up to Argentine imperialism in
                            order to obtain an acceptable settlement in the Chaco.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation progressed, in spite of Finot’s repeated assertions
                            that he desired an equitable settlement, it became evident that he was
                            more eager to justify the Bolivian action than to appreciate the stand
                            taken by the United States Government that Bolivia has given no overt
                            intention to provide just and equitable compensation to the owners of
                            these properties nor manifested any disposition to <pb n="288"
                                xml:id="pg_288" facs="0298"/>arbitrate or otherwise adjudicate any
                            rights or equities which may be involved.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Calvo is scheduled to arrive in La Paz this afternoon, and Mr.
                                Pannill<note n="41" xml:id="d303fn41">F. C. Pannill, representative,
                                Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.</note> on Monday. The United
                            States having given definite notice to Bolivia of its especial interest
                            in this matter, and the way being left open for friendly mediatory
                            action, I should like to repeat that it would seem wise for the Legation
                            to stand aside at this juncture, reserving any further action until the
                            trend of the discussions indicates whether or not Bolivia, in spite of
                            its present attitude, accedes to a friendly adjustment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 221, dated May 8, 1937, and to report that during my usual call on
                            diplomatic reception day, May 11, 1937, Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            Finot informed me that the reply to the Secretary’s personal message
                            would be drafted within a few days.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Finot also volunteered information of his two talks with Dr. Carlos
                            Calvo. According to Dr. Finot, Dr. Calvo’s attitude is that: he is here
                            to hold preliminary conversations on behalf of the Company; has advised
                            the Company against recourse to the Bolivian courts; no appeal for
                            United States Government assistance is contemplated by the Company (Dr.
                            Finot observed to me that such a course is forbidden by the contract,
                            even in case of denial of justice); the two had agreed that it would be
                            better for the negotiations to be carried on in La Paz only, without
                            interference by New York; Dr. Calvo had asked for the Government’s
                            terms, but that he had made the observation that discussions could
                            continue only on the basis of a reasonable offer from the Company for a
                            settlement; and that Dr. Calvo had told Finot that he had accepted the
                            task of negotiating an adjustment because, as a Bolivian, he wished to
                            do everything he could to avoid a situation where Bolivia appeared to be
                            closing the door to foreign capital.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Calvo called yesterday afternoon, and his review of the two
                            conversations with Dr. Finot tallies substantially with the outline
                            given me by Dr. Finot. Dr. Calvo informed me that during his preliminary
                                <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0299"/>conversations he stressed
                            the legal aspects of the case and is confident that he has undermined
                            Dr. Finot’s cocksureness of the legality of the Government’s action. Dr.
                            Calvo is eminently qualified to discuss the legal aspects of the case as
                            he was the legal adviser who drafted both the Richmond Levering and the
                            Standard Oil contracts. Dr. Calvo added that he had stated to the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs that a prior admission of guilt on the part
                            of the Company could not be considered.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Calvo commended the attitude of the Legation in keeping before the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs the Department’s interest in the matter but
                            of making no formal representations. He feels that it is not advisable
                            at this stage of the negotiations to have New York stir up Washington
                            too much. He also urged upon me the desirability of remaining in La Paz
                            during the preliminary negotiations, principally on account of the
                            psychological effect thereof. Dr. Calvo appeared confident that an
                            adjustment would be arrived at without undue delay, the negotiations
                            being facilitated by the Company’s having no desire to attempt to
                            re-enter Bolivia and indicated that the Company would be satisfied to
                            receive twenty-five cents on the dollar on its investment in
                            Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. F. C. Pannill has not yet arrived in La Paz, but is scheduled here on
                            May 15th.</p>

                        <p>30. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 14, May 7, 1 p.m., Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs handed me May 15, 4 p.m., personal reply to message
                            of Secretary of State reflecting fully the conciliatory spirit of the
                            original communication. While he is personally convinced of correctness
                            and legality of his Government’s acts, Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            assures the Secretary that he will cooperate fully toward whatever
                            adjustment may be feasible which, without entering into the legality of
                            the measures adopted, would demonstrate that in Bolivia foreign capital
                            is guaranteed and protected.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my recent
                            despatches regarding the steps being taken to endeavor to recover the
                            properties of the Standard Oil Company seized by the Bolivian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>From conversations with Dr. Carlos Calvo I have gathered that while he is
                            preparing an exposition of the legal aspects of the Company’s position,
                            he realizes that considerations of legality are of doubtful force.
                            However, both he and Mr. C. J. [<hi rend="italic">F. C</hi>] Pannill
                            consider that an effort should be made in this direction, the latter
                            believing that should it be possible to force some acknowledgment
                            regarding the justification of the Company’s claims, he may then be able
                            more successfully to follow the instructions which he has received from
                            New York to request, for tactical reasons, that the Company be allowed
                            to resume operations in Bolivia pending a final adjustment of the
                            matter. Actually, the Company wishes to sell out and has no intention of
                            reopening its business in this country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pannill and Dr. Calvo still maintain the belief that it would be
                            injudicious at this point to appeal to the courts and are prepared to
                            recommend a policy of delay should initial negotiations prove
                            unavailing. If it should be found necessary to adopt this policy they
                            believe that it would be advisable for the Company to send an American
                            representative to Bolivia to look after its interests and to take
                            whatever action might be necessary in view of future developments,
                            possibly over a period of years.</p>
                        <p>It should be remarked, however, that a policy of procrastination may
                            seriously interfere with Bolivia’s negotiations with the Argentine as
                            reports from Buenos Aires indicate that the latter country would prefer
                            to postpone an agreement with Bolivia until the latter has a clear title
                            to the properties.</p>
                        <p>For the moment the matter rests at this stage pending the completion of
                            Dr. Calvo’s brief and the return of the Foreign Minister from Sucre
                            toward the latter part of the week.</p>

                                facs="0301"/>preliminary conversation with the Bolivian Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs yesterday. The immediate object of Mr. Pannill’s visit
                            was to inquire, under instructions from New York, directly of Dr. Finot
                            whether or not the Junta of Government was prepared to revoke, or
                            cancel, the decree of March 13, 1937, as an essential precedent to the
                            opening of discussions. Dr. Finot emphatically replied that this would
                            be impossible for internal political reasons. Dr. Finot added that there
                            was no object in discussing the legal aspects of the case for, “right or
                            wrong, the Government is right”. He added that since the Company, for
                            its own reasons, does not desire to go to the Supreme Court, the only
                            way out is for a transactional agreement, and added that the final
                            agreement could be so drawn up that it would be in fact a revocation of
                            the decree of March 13, 1937. Mr. Pannill informed me that Dr. Finot
                            received him most cordially, and he gathered a distinct impression that
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs wants an adjustment.</p>
                        <p>Present indications are that if the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey is
                            merely interested in getting out of Bolivia, desires only to obtain as
                            much financial compensation as possible and is not interested in the
                            equities of the case, an agreement would not be impossible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pannill, however, is becoming more and more inclined to the view that
                            the aim of the Company should be to thwart the Bolivian Government’s
                            acts and delay it from consummating its plans with the Y. P. F. of
                            Argentina. Dr. Finot mentioned to Mr. Pannill during the course of the
                            conversation that Bolivia was at the mercy of the Argentine in this, as
                            well as in other matters. Mr. Pannill feels that this case might be made
                            a good precedent to all Latin American countries, particularly the
                            Argentine and Peru, that the Standard Oil Company prefers to accept
                            financial losses than to allow these countries to get the impression
                            that it can be forcibly expulsed.</p>
                        <p>I personally feel that an agreement without some prior understanding
                            regarding cancellation of the March 13 decree is not advisable. It would
                            appear that the best course would be for the Company to present the
                            memorandum regarding the legal aspects of the case (this has not yet
                            been completed by Dr. Carlos Calvo), then make a formal petition that
                            the decree be cancelled and the Company’s previous status fully
                            restored, as a precedent to opening discussions towards an agreement
                            legally transferring the properties to the Government. I am confident
                            that Toro and Finot would not dare cancel the decree in view of the
                            internal political situation. The result would be that the Company would
                            have to bide its time until the political set-up here changes and then
                            have recourse to the Bolivian courts.</p>
                        <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0302"/>
                        <p>I have come to the conclusion that this would be the better course since
                            any agreement otherwise made with the Government would inevitably be
                            interpreted throughout Latin America as a successful expulsion of the
                            Standard Oil Company by the Bolivian Government, would eliminate any
                            legal rights the Company might still have, the Company could expect very
                            little compensation the payment of which would always be problematical,
                            and it would be playing into the hands of the Argentine Y. P. F. The
                            Bolivian Junta of Government at present appears to be wobbly, and any
                            agreement involving payment over a period of time would probably not be
                            recognized by any succeeding Government, particularly not by the young
                            militarists.</p>

                            sent word to Dr. Carlos Calvo insisting that an agreement should be
                            arrived at without delay.</p>
                        <p>The “hands off” decision of the Company is in line with the suggestions
                            of this Legation as contained in Minister Norweb’s despatch No. 244, of
                            June 4, 1937. The Company would appear to be warranted in delaying
                            matters while studying the implications of the Bolivian Government’s
                            action on its interests in other Latin American <pb n="293"
                                xml:id="pg_293" facs="0303"/>countries. On the other hand, I do
                            believe that something should be done to keep the issue alive before the
                            Bolivian Government and, if possible, to counteract the universal
                            feeling among Bolivians that the Junta has done the Nation a great
                            service in ridding the country of the Standard Oil whose expulsion is
                            now a closed incident. I am astonished to find that such important
                            Bolivian officials as Mr. Antonio Campero Arce, Sub-Secretary of the
                            Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, and Mr. Walter Montenegro, Secretary to
                            President Toro, consider that the matter is closed; that the
                            Government’s action was fully justified; and that the United States
                            Government is not interested and will do nothing about the Standard Oil
                            case. I am confident that neither of these persons knows that the United
                            States Government has made its interest in the matter clearly evident to
                            that of Bolivia. The attitude of these two government officials is a
                            good reflection of that of the young “politicos” and of the
                            ex-combatants.</p>
                        <p>The press here treats the matter as definitely settled. The Yacimientos
                            Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos is proceeding with the extraction and
                            refining of petroleum products from the Standard Oil properties as if
                            they were definitely its own. The national petroleum distribution
                            company is developing a national distributing system under a fanfare of
                            publicity, citing the blessings to the country of being independent of
                            petroleum imports.</p>
                        <p>I have given considerable thought to the desirability of formulating, for
                            suggestion to the Department, some act or plan to counteract the general
                            impression amongst Bolivian officials and the Bolivian public generally
                            that the Standard Oil matter is now a closed incident; that the United
                            States Government is not interested and will not do anything. As to how
                            this can best be done, I have come to no definite conclusion. Even
                            though the Department were prepared to make an issue of the matter and
                            to press strongly for the return of the properties, strong official
                            representations would probably be unavailing at the present time. Such
                            official representations would go to Finot, possibly as far as Toro, and
                            certainly no further. I am confident that Toro and Finot would not dare
                            cancel the decree of March 13th in view of the uncertainty of the
                            internal political situation and that representations would not prevent
                            their continuing to pose before the public as national benefactors.
                            Should the United States unduly press such representations, forcing a
                            successful conclusion, the political repercussions would likely be such
                            as to precipitate the downfall of the present military Junta. This, in
                            turn, would provide political capital to opponents of the United States
                            and give rise to possible critcism of undue interference in internal
                            matters of a friendly country. Furthermore, it would adversely affect
                            the influence of the United States in the Chaco Peace Conference,
                            possibly endangering the success of those negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0304"/>
                        <p>Possibly a statement at one of the press conferences from an official of
                            the Department that the Standard Oil Company and the Bolivian Government
                            are still searching for an amicable settlement of their differences and
                            that it is the hope of the Department that a friendly adjustment may be
                            found in the near future, might serve the purpose. Such a statement
                            would have its effect on other Latin American governments, but I am
                            confident that Toro and Finot would see to it that it did not reach the
                            Bolivian public through the local press.</p>
                        <p>My only definite suggestion at this time is that the Standard Oil Company
                            should have a competent American representative in La Paz to observe
                            developments and little by little build up a situation to a point where
                            negotiations may again be resumed. His mere presence would keep the
                            matter before the Bolivian Government and populace generally,
                            particularly if he were the type that had the knack of mixing with local
                            officials and residents. In view of the internal political situation
                            this cannot be done effectively by the two Bolivian citizens now here
                            representing the Company.</p>

                            enclosing a memorandum dated September 7, 1937 regarding the
                            difficulties between the Bolivian government and the Standard Oil
                            Company of Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation with Sr. David Alvéstegui, Bolivian delegate to the
                            Chaco Peace Conference, on September 21, 1937, he informed me that
                            although he was not intimately informed on the state of oil negotiations
                            between Bolivia and Argentina, he knew that the head of the Y. P. F.
                            Boliviano has made several trips to Buenos Aires recently and that he
                            has held active conversations with officials of the Y. P. F.
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>It is Sr. Alvéstegui’s understanding that under the proposed agreement
                            Bolivian oil will not be purchased by the Argentine government or by the
                            Y. P. F. but will be permitted to enter Argentina “on the most favorable
                            basis possible,” and he understands thereby that it will compete equally
                            with Peruvian oil imported under the Argentine-Peruvian <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of February 1937. He does not know
                            how the oil will be marketed. I was informed that the final agreement is
                            being held in abeyance until the arrival here next month of Sr. Finot,
                            newly appointed Bolivian Minister to the Argentine, who having initiated
                            the whole business while serving as Foreign Minister wishes to conclude
                            the negotiations himself.</p>
                        <p>Sr. Alvéstegui tells me he has heard nothing from Bolivia to indicate
                            that a commission of reputable Bolivian citizens might be appointed to
                            study the question. The failure of Sr. Baldivieso to accept the Ministry
                            for Foreign Affairs may explain the silence.</p>
                        <p>Neither Ambassador Alvéstegui nor Ambassador Rodrigues Alves<note n="47"

                                    more conservative and reliable than its predecessor, this remark
                                    applying particularly to President Busch, who, although without
                                    large political experience, gives the impression of a definite
                                    desire to give to the country a reasonably honest and effective
                                    government. President Busch has secured the cooperation of a
                                    number of individuals who are generally respected for their
                                    ability and integrity, especially the Minister of Foreign
                                    Affairs, Dr. Fabián Vaca Chávez, the Minister of Finance, Dr.
                                    Federico Gutierrez Granier, and the Minister of Mines and
                                    Petroleum, Colonel Felipe M. Rivera, who spent three years as a
                                    student in the United States and who seems especially friendly.
                                    This Government has, of course, inherited a situation with
                                    regard to the development of oil in Bolivia which was not of its
                                    own making, and is accordingly in a better position to seek a
                                    solution than that of Colonel Toro, who was so openly and
                                    publicly committed to a specific, radical policy in this
                                    respect.</item>

                                <item>It seems to be generally recognized here in La Paz, as was at
                                    one time frankly acknowledged by Minister Finot in a
                                    conversation with Mr. Norweb, that the charges of fraud, on
                                    account of the shipment of 704 tons of crude oil by the Standard
                                    Oil Company of Bolivia in 1925–1926, were of a purely technical
                                    character. In any case, in connection with the decree of
                                    confiscation of March 13, 1937, and later, no real evidence was
                                    adduced that there had been any conscious or deliberate fraud on
                                    the part of the Standard Oil Company of Bolivia. If any facts of
                                    this character were in existence it would <pb n="297"
                                        xml:id="pg_297" facs="0307"/>seem reasonable to suppose that
                                    such information would have been made public long since. On the
                                    other hand, the real grievance of the Bolivian Government lay in
                                    the fact that the Standard Oil Company of Bolivia was supposed
                                    to be treating its oil concessions as a potential reserve and
                                    that, however sound the reasons might be from an economic point
                                    of view, it had proved unwilling to proceed to the development
                                    of these oil fields even to the extent of supplying the ordinary
                                    necessities of the country. There seems to be little doubt,
                                    accordingly, that a leading purpose in the measure of
                                    confiscation was the hope of securing the rapid development of
                                    oil regions which were supposed to be capable of very much
                                    larger production and, at the same time, of using the property
                                    thus acquired as a pawn in the solution of pending difficulties
                                    between Bolivia and Paraguay arising out of the controversy in
                                    the Chaco.</item>

                                <item>Almost from the beginning thoughtful and intelligent
                                    Bolivians, even those connected with the Government, came to
                                    realize that Bolivia had neither the capital nor the necessary
                                    technical ability or experience to work out by herself the
                                    difficult problems connected with the production of oil. Thus,
                                    it is currently reported that, even without capital charges, the
                                    small quantity of gasoline now produced is marketed at a serious
                                    loss. Accordingly, it has been entirely natural for Bolivia to
                                    look to outside assistance in this respect, particularly to
                                    Argentina and to some extent Brazil. A solution along these
                                    lines has, however, proved to be much more difficult than had
                                    been previously expected, partly on account of the well known
                                    rivalry between these two neighbors and also on account of the
                                    very doubtful legality of the Bolivian Government’s title to the
                                    property of the Standard Oil Company of Bolivia under the
                                    confiscatory decree of March 13, 1937.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Probably for the reasons indicated above, members of the
                                    present government make no secret whatsoever of their desire to
                                    arrive at a definite solution which would remove existing doubts
                                    as to the validity of title. In the existing political situation
                                    it would obviously be extremely difficult for even a very strong
                                    government to cancel the confiscatory decree or to make an
                                    outright return of the property in question. It seems probable,
                                    however, that the Bolivian Government would be willing to
                                    consider an arrangement withdrawing previous charges of
                                    conscious fraud and arranging for compensation to the Standard
                                    Oil Company of Bolivia for the property rights which the
                                    Bolivian Government greatly needs in connection with both its
                                    diplomatic and its economic plans. It has even been suggested in
                                    this connection that indirect technical participation by the
                                    Standard Oil Company might not be unwelcome to Bolivian
                                    authorities as a possible off-set to the only other alternative,
                                    which would appear to be the <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298"

                                    Bolivia by such powerful neighbors as Argentina or

                        <p>In this connection it may also be mentioned that it is the belief of
                            certain diplomatic colleagues who are often well informed, particularly
                            the Peruvian and the Mexican Ministers, that the question of the oil
                            fields is intimately connected with negotiations for a final settlement
                            of difficulties in the Chaco and that a previous settlement of the oil
                            problem would facilitate the determination of a definite, permanent
                            boundary between Paraguay and Bolivia in this region.</p>

                            Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>In conversation yesterday with a high official of the Brazilian Foreign
                            Office, this official stated that the Brazilian Mission which has been
                            in Bolivia recently has completed its studies and will return very
                            shortly to Rio de Janeiro and will submit certain recommendations to the
                            Brazilian Government. He explained that Brazil has become increasingly
                            concerned at Argentine economic expansion into Bolivia, which Brazil
                            feared would bring southern Bolivia under Argentine influence in much
                            the same way that Paraguay now is. He especially referred to the alleged
                            Bolivian-Argentine agreement under which there will be constructed, with
                            Argentine capital, a railway from the Argentine frontier north to Santa
                            Cruz. The Foreign Office understands that the section from the Argentine
                            frontier to Camiri will be administered as an Argentine railway pure and
                            simple, while the section from Camiri to Santa Cruz will be administered
                            by Bolivia as a Bolivian railway. In order to combat this Argentine
                            penetration into Bolivia, the Brazilian Mission has made the following
                            recommendations which the Foreign Office believes will be adopted by the
                            Brazilian Government: <list>
                                <item>Firstly, Brazil will construct a railway from Porto Esperança
                                    to Corumbá and from Corumbá to Santa Cruz.</item>
                                <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0309"/>
                                <item>Secondly, Brazil will construct a railway from Santa Cruz to
                                    Cochabamba; and</item>
                                <item>Thirdly, studies will be made of the posibility of
                                    construction, either of a railway or a motor road, from Santa
                                    Cruz north to Puerto Grether.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office official pointed out that inasmuch as the principal
                            oil fields are located between Yacuiba and Camiri, these fields will be
                            more accessible to Argentina than to Brazil. However, Brazil hopes that
                            at some future date arrangements may be made to secure at least part of
                            the oil. It would then be possible to transport the oil by railway to
                            Santa Cruz, Corumbá, and thence to São Paulo. He added that should the
                            railway or motor road finally be constructed from Santa Cruz to Puerto
                            Grether, this will also make it possible to transport petroleum to
                            northern Brazil via the Rio Ichilo–Rio Mamore–Rio Madera and thence via
                            the Amazon River. He explained, however, that Brazil has made absolutely
                            no arrangement with the Bolivian Government as regards the purchase of
                            petroleum, and this question will only be taken up in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office official added that, under the Treaty of Petropolis of

                            construction upon the Porto Esperança–Corumbá–Santa Cruz section, which
                            he estimates will cost approximately one and a half million pounds

                                printed.</note> I have the honor to report that Mr. H. A. Metzger,
                            special representative of the Standard Oil Company, arrived in La <pb
                                n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0310"/>Paz on October 9th, and that
                            after various exploratory conversations, interviews were arranged
                            through the Foreign Office in which I presented Mr. Metzger to the
                            Minister of Mines and Petroleum on October 18th, and to the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs on the following day, stating on each occasion that I
                            was presenting Mr. Metzger to them in the hope that through friendly,
                            informal conversations, directly undertaken between the two parties, the
                            issues might be sufficiently clarified to make possible at the proper
                            time an equitable solution of existing difficulties which might prove
                            satisfactory to each of the two parties, with each of which we had a
                            friendly relationship.</p>
                        <p>In the conversation on October 18th with the Minister of Mines and
                            Petroleum, who is, of course, the officer of Government chiefly
                            concerned with this matter, after the initial remarks on my part
                            reported above, the Minister, Colonel Rivera, from whom I had previously
                            ascertained personally that he would like to have an opportunity to talk
                            to Mr. Metzger, entered at once into the fundamental problem in a tone
                            which seemed both to Mr. Metzger and myself definitely friendly and
                            encouraging.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated at the outset that neither he personally nor—he felt
                            sure—the Junta of Government, would be in a position to take the
                            initiative in suggesting any given, concrete solution which might seem
                            to imply a criticism of a previous government. He did feel very
                            strongly, however, that it was very important to keep the door open for
                            an eventual solution, and he went on to say that it was for that reason
                            that he had especially welcomed an opportunity for an initial interview
                            with Mr. Metzger. The Minister suggested in this connection the
                            desirability of the submission of one or more plans to be presented to
                            him by the representative of the Standard Oil Company and which would
                            serve as a basis for friendly discussions. Colonel Rivera again
                            emphasized at this point the necessity for a conciliatory approach on
                            the part of the Company. He called attention to the delicacy of the
                            problem on account of the existing state of public opinion in the
                            country and closed with the renewed hope that the door might be kept
                            open, and that with patience and good will on both sides an equitable
                            solution might be eventually arrived at.</p>
                        <p>The interview on the next day with the Minister for Foreign Affairs was
                            friendly but naturally very general in character, and did not serve to
                            throw any further light on the probable attitude of the existing
                            Government to possible direct negotiations. Mr. Metzger and I were,
                            however, both impressed with the desirability of meeting Colonel
                            Rivera’s suggestions of October 18th at least halfway, in the same
                            friendly spirit which he had displayed, it being, of course, my
                            understanding that having once presented Mr. Metzger to Colonel Rivera
                                <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0311"/>further conversations would
                            naturally be carried on at the proper time between the two parties
                            directly concerned, without any immediate necessity for direct
                            assistance on the part of the Legation.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, accordingly, Mr. Metzger prepared a brief
                            telegraphic report to his Company in which he suggested the acceptance
                            of Colonel Rivera’s invitation and presented two alternative plans for
                            the consideration of New York, the first involving cancellation of the
                            decree of March 13th and an offer of sale on the part of the Company at
                            an equitable price later to be determined between the two parties, and
                            the second and alternative proposition involving an offer of a further
                            investment of as much as $15,000,000 by the Company for the intensive
                            development of the existing oil fields over a period of the next fifteen
                            years, the details of this second plan having been already worked out by
                            technical experts of the Company in Buenos Aires for consideration by
                            New York if such a plan should prove to be practicable.</p>
                        <p>Merely on the basis of the conversation with Colonel Rivera reported
                            above, one or the other of these plans seemed to have a reasonable
                            promise of serving at least as a basis for friendly discussion. Even if
                            the suggested plans were rejected in their initial form, the door would
                            at least be left open, as Colonel Rivera had suggested, for such
                            modifications or suggestions as might arise in the course of initial
                            interviews on this subject.</p>
                        <p>When, however, Mr. Metzger consulted yesterday the local attorney of the
                            Standard Oil Company of Bolivia, Dr. Carlos Calvo, he found that Dr.
                            Calvo was very pessimistic as to the possibility of any direct
                            arrangement with the existing government. Dr. Calvo had no doubt that
                            Colonel Rivera would personally favor an equitable compromise, but he
                            did not believe that in existing political conditions the present
                            government would be strong enough to support Colonel Rivera in his
                            position. Dr. Calvo also believed that the second plan, involving
                            possible resumption of operations by the Standard Oil Company in Bolivia
                            would never be accepted by any government here. He also emphasized the
                            strong legal position of the Company and advised again, as he had
                            previously done in the public press, a period of watchful waiting with
                            an eventual appeal to the courts, in which sooner or later he believed
                            that the Company would win a complete judicial victory. Dr. Calvo
                            acknowledged, however, that the process which he had in mind would
                            probably require as much as five or ten years, during which time the
                            problem of the Standard Oil Company would continue to be a more or less
                            disturbing factor in current local politics.</p>
                        <p>In view of the two very different approaches to the problem which have
                            now been suggested by Colonel Rivera and by Dr. Calvo, Mr. Metzger is
                            now giving further consideration to the report and the <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0312"/>recommendations which he will be
                            sending to New York within the course of the next few days.</p>

                        <p>62. Referring to my despatch 53, dated October 23 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >22</hi>], Calvo has now been reliably informed that the Government
                            is considering a decree in few days requiring submission of controversy
                            to court within 90 days. Such action would automatically prevent direct
                            discussions which Calvo now agrees with Metzger in recommending to New
                            York. Foreign Office requests copies of messages contained in
                            Department’s telegram No. 10, of April 26, 8 p.m. and 14, May 7, 1 p.m.
                            and of Finot’s reply which Finot did not leave in their files. In the
                            circumstances the copies requested or fresh instructions of similar
                            tenor seem desirable to promote direct friendly negotiations.</p>

                            the second paragraph of the Department’s telegram no. 10 of April 26, 8

                        <p>The Department’s telegram no. 14, May 7, 1 p.m. contains a personal and
                            confidential message from the Secretary to Dr. Finot. The Department
                            would have no objection to allowing the Bolivian Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs to have a copy of that message as quoted in the telegram, but,
                            as a matter of courtesy to Dr. Finot, the Department is of the opinion
                            that the Foreign Office should also obtain Dr. Finot’s agreement to such
                            procedure. As concerns Dr. Finot’s reply to the Secretary’s message (see

                            Bolivian Foreign Office to request and receive from Dr. Finot a copy of
                            the reply under reference. If the Foreign Office does obtain a copy of
                            Dr. Finot’s reply, you are requested to explain to the Bolivian Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs that no further communication was sent to Dr. Finot
                            because of the fact that direct negotiations between the Bolivian
                            Government and the company’s representatives in La Paz had been
                            resumed.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that there is no action it can
                            appropriately take with respect to the decree of October 22. Subsequent
                            action by this Government will depend of course, upon the situation that
                            results from the submittal of the case to the supreme court of
                            Bolivia.</p>

                            express to him the continuing interest of your Government in the
                            Standard Oil Company case, and repeat the hope of your Government that a

                            may be reached through direct negotiations between the two parties

                            Minister that, in the opinion of the Department, an extension of the
                            period of 90 days set by the decree appears justifiable in order to
                            allow the company time for an adequate presentation of its case; and
                            that, consequently, the Department hopes that the Bolivian Government
                            will extend the time limit of 90 days to such reasonable period as may
                            be deemed necessary by the company’s counsel.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Armstrong</hi>: With reference to my
                            conversation with you and Mr. Pannill last week, the American Minister
                            at La Paz is being instructed to express to the appropriate officials of
                            the Bolivian Government the hope that the time limit of ninety days, set
                            in the Bolivian decree of October 22, may be extended as concerns the
                            case of the Standard Oil Company of Bolivia. Reports received by the
                            Department are to the effect that the Bolivian Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs has informally given the impression that such an extension might
                            be granted.</p>
                        <p>There are several factors which have led the Department to the decision
                            that it should not request arbitration of the case at this time. In
                            spite of the considerations set forth in the memorandum of November 8,
                                1937,<note n="53" xml:id="d318fn53">Not printed.</note> which you
                            left with me, the fact remains that there has been no resort to the
                            Bolivian courts regarding the cancellation of the contract. In the
                            second place, it is understood that Bolivian officials have stated that
                            the decree of October 22 should not interfere with “prospective
                            informal, exploratory conversations with the representative of the
                            Standard Oil Company now in La Paz”. Finally, you will appreciate that
                            there are inherent dangers in proceeding to arbitrate in the absence of
                            exhaustion of remedies provided by Bolivian law, especially in view of
                            the Calvo clause in the concession contract.</p>
                        <p>It is the judgment of this Department that in order to protect the
                            company’s rights the company should take immediate steps to present its
                            case to the Supreme Court of Bolivia before the expiration of the
                            ninety-day period set in the decree of October 22, in order to avoid
                            difficulties in the event that an extension of this period should not be
                            granted. There appears to be reason to believe that such legal steps
                            need not prejudice the informal and friendly discussions which have been
                            initiated between representatives of the Bolivian Government and of the
                            company.</p>

                        <p>65. In conversation yesterday based on Department’s telegram No. 30,
                            November 13, 7 p.m., Foreign Minister assured me Bolivian Government
                            would keep door open for friendly negotiations. Success would depend on
                            conciliatory formula taking into account not only the principle but also
                            the practical difficulties of the problem for Bolivian Government.</p>
                        <p>He promised to recommend extension of 90-day period to Junta of
                            Government in order to allow time for direct negotiations and will
                            convey decision reached to me as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my telegram No. 65 of
                            November 16, 9 a.m. I have the honor to report that I have not yet
                            received a reply regarding my inquiry made to the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs on November 15, as to the possibility of an extension of the
                            ninety day period provided by the decree of October 22, in order to
                            allow adequate time for the preparation of its case by the Standard Oil
                            Company as well as to facilitate informal negotiations in a friendly
                            spirit. It seems probable that a decision on this important question
                            will not be reached until the regular meeting of the Junta of Government
                            which is expected to take place on Friday morning November 19.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime President Busch has given an interview to the press which
                            appeared in <hi rend="italic">La Razon</hi> for November 16, (of which a
                            complete translation is enclosed in Despatch No. 72 dated November
                                17,<note n="54" xml:id="d320fn54">Not printed.</note>) in which
                            among other topics he re-states publicly his belief in the illegal
                            character of the acts previously charged by the Government against the
                            Standard Oil Company of Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>I continue to believe that the friendly conversations which have been
                            proposed may still be useful in giving more time for careful
                            consideration of all aspects of the case. In the light of the recent
                            public declaration by the President of the Bolivian Republic, I have
                            however <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0316"/>come somewhat
                            reluctantly to the conclusion that the issue between the Government and
                            the Company is now too sharp and definite to be capable of ready
                            adjustment or compromise.</p>
                        <p>On the one hand the Bolivian Government has stated publicly on various
                            occasions that the Company was guilty of deliberate frauds which
                            justify, morally and legally, the confiscatory decree of March 13, 1937.
                            On the other hand the Company maintains the position that no frauds were
                            committed and that the decree of March 13, is wholly arbitrary and
                            illegal; and further points out the fact that, although the Government
                            has had exclusive control of the confidential files of the Company since
                            the date indicated above, convincing evidence of deliberate fraud has
                            not yet been adduced, for the reason that in its judgment such evidence
                            does not exist.</p>
                        <p>On an issue so sharply and publicly drawn, it seems to me almost
                            impossible for either this Government or any other which is likely to
                            succeed it to give a decision favorable to the Company, at least on the
                            fundamental question of principle which is involved. This difficulty
                            applies not only to the executive branch but also to the judiciary which
                            is—as I believe reliably reported—to be completely subject to the
                            control of the executive.</p>
                        <p>Even such a favorable judgment on the main question, entirely improbable
                            as it seems, would scarcely be satisfactory from the broader point of
                            view of the American interests in this part of the world. For there can
                            be little doubt that the agency, either executive or judicial, making
                            such a favorable decision would at once be charged not only by the
                            newspapers in Bolivia but also throughout South America with having
                            yielded to pressure from the American Government; and some newspapers
                            would undoubtedly go so far as to say that the agency in question had
                            yielded not only to intimidation but even to bribery.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand in case, as seems entirely probable, the executive or
                            judicial opinion should be unfavorable to the Company, the Company would
                            undoubtedly continue to believe, with considerable show of reason, that
                            it had been the victim of a prejudiced unilateral decision; and for that
                            reason the amicable solution of the question would be made still more
                            difficult and remote than it is today.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental question at issue is however a definite matter of law and
                            of fact; and especially in the new circumstances which have now arisen,
                            I venture to express the personal belief that it is exactly the kind of
                            a question which ought to be capable of solution, with due regard to the
                            proper dignity of all parties concerned, by the adjudication of an
                            impartial outside agency; and to add that in my judgment a situation has
                            now arisen in which such a solution is the only one which gives any
                            great promise of just and mutually satisfactory results. This seems
                            especially true because such a solution <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307"
                                facs="0317"/>would be so completely in accord with the principles so
                            recently enunciated at Buenos Aires and because it would avoid
                            inevitable criticisms which would otherwise be raised by one party or
                            the other against the American Government on grounds of supposed
                            partiality in the case.</p>
                        <p>In this purely tentative suggestion, I do not of course have in mind, at
                            least at the present time, anything approaching a formal international
                            arbitration. For I realize that the position of the American Government
                            is that of a friendly mediator rather than of a party to the dispute.
                            For that reason, and also because of the decisive character of the
                            result for the two parties directly concerned, such reference of the
                            fundamental issue to an impartial outside agency would almost
                            necessarily originate with one or the other of the two parties, perhaps
                            as an item in the friendly conversations which have been proposed.</p>
                        <p>It seems reasonable to suppose that the Bolivian Government might welcome
                            a possible solution which, in the light of existing local opinion on the
                            question, would relieve it from the necessity for a direct decision
                            which must at best prove to be difficult and embarrassing. Since,
                            however, the attitude of either party to such a possible solution is as
                            yet necessarily unknown, and remains a matter of mere surmise, if at any
                            time direct information should seem desirable to the Department, it
                            would of course be feasible, and perhaps even helpful, to sound out in a
                            purely personal and informal way the views of the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs on a solution of this general type, and in the first instance
                            purely as a matter of background regarding an important question of
                            common interest.</p>

                        <p>31. Your despatch 73, November 17, 1937. The Department will be very glad
                            to have any suggestions that may lead to a solution of the Standard Oil
                            Company’s case. However, before reaching any decision regarding a
                            discussion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as set forth in the
                            last paragraph of your despatch, the Department would have to have more
                            specific information regarding what you have in mind as “an impartial
                            outside agency.”</p>
                        <p>With reference to the last paragraph of your despatch 74, November
                                19,<note n="55" xml:id="d323fn55">Not printed.</note> the Department
                            already has informed the New York office of the Standard Oil Company
                            that the Department believes the Company should present its case to the
                            Supreme Court in accordance with the provisions of the decree of October
                            22, in order to protect the Company’s legal position.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your telegram 68, November 27, 5 p.m., please telegraph
                            briefly the reasons for the deportation of Calvo. The Department has not
                            notified the New York office of the Company regarding the deportation,
                            since it is of the opinion that it should not act as a vehicle of
                            communication for the Company.</p>

                        <p>70. As to paragraph 1 of the Department’s telegram No. 31, December 2,
                            concrete suggestion which I had in mind but which has been discussed
                            with no one would be submission of title now held <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> by YPFB to eminent jurist to be selected by President of
                            the Argentine <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0319"/>Republic or other
                            American Republic at joint request of Bolivia and the United States
                            acting as mediatory agencies. On account of special interests neither
                            party could easily reject proposal which would probably add to friendly
                            feeling for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Deportation of Calvo was followed late same day by that of Saavedra.
                            Reason officially given was subversive political activities, but action
                            was taken without knowledge or approval of Foreign Minister. In Calvo’s
                            case there can be little doubt that a leading reason was his connection
                            with the Standard Oil Company which was regarded by military leaders as
                            unpatriotic.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department refers to your telegrams
                            nos. 70, December 3, 2 p.m., and 71, December 3, 3 p.m., and to its
                            telegraphic instruction in reply thereto regarding the Standard Oil
                            Company of Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>Since the Bolivian Government is one of the parties to the dispute, the
                            Department is of the opinion that the Bolivian Government could <pb
                                n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0320"/>not very well act as a
                            mediatory agency in the case. Nor does it seem advisable to the
                            Department that the Government of the United States, at the present
                            time, should join in any request for the appointment by the President of
                            Argentina or some other American republic of an eminent jurist to pass
                            upon the question of the title to the properties involved. The
                            Department is of the opinion that the company should exhaust all of its
                            remedies in Bolivia, and that every effort should be made to continue
                            conversations between the Bolivian Government and the company, looking
                            toward a possible solution of the present difficulties. The signature of
                            a convention on petroleum between Bolivia and Argentina would appear to
                            give the Government of the latter country a special interest in the case
                            and so make it inadvisable that the President of Argentina should be
                            requested to select a jurist as suggested by you.</p>
                        <p>If the procedure favored by the Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs is
                            followed, namely, that both conversations between the Government and the
                            company and court action upon the case be postponed until after the
                            establishment of a constitutional government following the elections in
                            March, it seems to the Department that no constructive action will be
                            possible for several months. Presumably, also, as soon as a
                            constitutional government is organized and a congress is in session,
                            action will be taken upon ratification of the petroleum convention
                            between Bolivia and Paraguay. It would seem highly desirable that, if
                            possible, friendly conversations between representatives of the Bolivian
                            Government and the company should be resumed as soon as conditions make
                            such conversations possible.</p>
                        <p>The Department will be glad to have your further comment upon these
                            factors in the case and in the light of whatever decision may be reached
                            by the Junta of Government.</p>

                        <p>147. My 146, November 10, 3 p.m.<note n="1" xml:id="d333fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me this
                            afternoon that he desired to explain to me, before any other Ambassador,
                            the political situation leading up to the events of today. He said that
                            the Government had found itself faced with an electoral campaign which
                            would have inevitably ended in a revolution. For this reason the
                            President had endeavored to find a compromise third candidate. With this
                            in mind he sent an emissary to the governors of the various states but
                            was unable to obtain the consent of the governors of Pernambuco and
                            Bahia.</p>
                        <p>This Minister added that the constitution of 1934 did not give the
                            Executive strong enough powers to govern the country properly. After
                            carefully sounding out public opinion in the different states, he has
                            put forth by decree a new constitution which will be submitted at an
                            early date to a plebiscite. This constitution will preserve the
                            democratic institutions but will give additional powers to the President
                            and will provide for his continuing in office for 6 years more. The
                            constitution makes special provision for the welfare of the laboring
                            classes.</p>
                        <p>The Minister added that it is not the intention of the Government to
                            persecute individuals and only a few politicians have been placed under
                            detention in their own homes. Furthermore, all of the members of the
                            Cabinet with the exception of the Minister of Agriculture are now in
                            agreement with the President. The Minister of Agriculture alone has
                            resigned and will shortly be replaced.</p>
                        <p>The Minister added that the Government intends to continue its present
                            foreign policy, and especially its cordial relations with the United
                            States, and has no imperialistic aims or designs. The Minister said that
                            the Government fully realized the need of foreign capital <pb n="313"
                                xml:id="pg_313" facs="0323"/>and assistance in developing the nation
                            and he explained that the Government intends to pursue a very liberal
                            policy with respect to foreign capital and foreigners who have
                            legitimate interests in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>The Minister asserted emphatically that integralism had no part
                            whatsoever in the present change. He characterized the Integralistas as
                            “clowns in the political circus” and nothing more. In fact, he said that
                            one of the primary reasons for the coup of today came from the
                            President’s realization that decisive action was necessary to “put the
                            brakes” on the growing Integralista movement.</p>
                        <p>The Minister earnestly hopes that the United States will adopt an
                            attitude of sympathy and understanding toward the present changes.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion the coup of today is the climax of a carefully prepared
                            plan. I believe that it was the President’s intention, however, to put
                            it into effect next week and that the action of today was precipitated
                            by Deputy Machado’s reading of the manifesto yesterday.</p>
                        <p>I might add that I am a little skeptical about the effective
                            “preservation of democratic institutions” under the new
                            constitution.</p>

                        <p>74. Personal for the Ambassador from the Under Secretary. The press in
                            this country, as was to be anticipated, has reacted immediately to
                            recent events in Brazil by emphasizing the Fascist nature of the new
                            setup and by intimating that the change in government must have some
                            connection with the Rome-Berlin Axis.</p>
                        <p>In order to attempt to prevent unduly exaggerated stories of this
                            character which might in the long run have a definitely prejudicial
                            effect upon our relations with Brazil, I had an entirely off the record
                            and personal conversation with some of the American correspondents and
                            editorial writers yesterday in which I indicated my purely personal
                            belief, from the information which I had received, that the change which
                            has taken place in Brazil was not inspired by the European dictatorships
                            and corresponded to a tendency which has frequently been manifested in
                            Latin American republics in past years. I made no effort to under
                            estimate the Fascist and Nazi propaganda in Brazil and I likewise added
                            that it would be premature to form any final conclusions, but that for
                            the moment, at least, I had no great anxiety with regard to the
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>I wish at as early a moment as you deem appropriate you would endeavor to
                            have a private conversation with President Vargas which will not be
                            known to the public and ascertain from him what his reactions may be to
                            the claims publicly made in Rome and in Berlin <pb n="314"
                                xml:id="pg_314" facs="0324"/>that the recent change in the Brazilian
                            Government is one which is sympathetic to the regime in Germany and in
                            Italy.</p>
                        <p>I understand from your recent telegrams that the Integralista party has
                            no part in the present setup but that, at least until very recently, it
                            appeared to support President Vargas and to have his tacit approval. I
                            should appreciate such further light as you may throw on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Under present conditions I feel that we should have the fullest
                            information possible with regard to all developments in Brazil and
                            specifically with regard to any possible increased influence with the
                            Government of the German and Italian Governments. In this connection I
                            suggest for your consideration that you instruct the principal consular
                            officers under your jurisdiction to have a conference with you in Rio
                            and that you advise them very confidentially of your need to have the
                            fullest information which they may obtain for you with regard to the
                            activities of the German and Italian colonies within their respective
                            jurisdictions, and likewise all information possible concerning
                            increased propaganda from German and Italian sources.</p>
                        <p>Our relations with President Vargas and with his associates have been so
                            particularly close and friendly during these recent years that I, of
                            course, cannot assume that those relations will be in any way affected
                            by the recent change in government. I should like, of course, to have
                            reassurances on this point.</p>

                            communication with the Catette since yesterday on the question of the
                            President’s issuing a press statement in regard to the Government’s
                            alleged Rome-Berlin tendencies, et cetera, et cetera. The President sent
                            me word last night that he would issue this afternoon a statement to the
                            press denying those connections, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_315" facs="0325"/>Vargas who confirmed (my 158, November
                            13, 1 p.m.) the message sent me last night. He said that “it is
                            laughable to think that the Germans, Italians or Japanese had any
                            connection whatever with the recent movement; nor had Integralistas in
                            any way. The new constitution is in no way Integralista or Nazi or
                            Fascist and my Government has absolutely no connection with Rome, Berlin
                            or Tokyo.” He went on at some length to explain to me the reasons for
                            the recent <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> (along the lines set out
                            by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in my telegram 147, November 10 but
                            more in detail). He emphasized his desire for continuing the close and
                            friendly relations which have existed between our two countries during
                            these recent years.</p>

                            of government in Brazil, before President Vargas term of office expired
                            the Constitution was abrogated and a new Constitution proclaimed which
                            continues him in office subject to a plebiscite at some as yet
                            undetermined date. Inasmuch as the Department may be confronted with
                            similar situations in other countries I would appreciate your comment
                            with regard to the question as to whether or not the need for
                            recognition arises under the above circumstances.</p>

                            respect to political changes that have taken place in Brazil, no
                            occasion arises for extending recognition to the present government. It
                            seems to me that the question whether the abrogation of the former
                            Constitution and the promulgation of a new one, and the continuance of
                            President Vargas in office under the new Constitution have been brought
                            about by appropriate processes is a matter primarily for consideration
                            by that country and its people. The situation is not analogous to that
                            presented where the recognized government has been ousted by a <hi

                            some form of recognition is necessary. It may, of course, take the form
                            of our treating with the government in the regular way or some more
                            formal act.</p>
                        <p>2. A formal act of recognition is not required where the existing

                            the Constitution by a new one or setting it aside. If that government

                                Stat. 943.</note> Under the Agreement each country by lowering
                            various tariff restrictions prepared the way for an increase in trade
                            between them. Further, by exchanging pledges against the increase in
                            existing duties or the application of new duties on many products vital
                            in their trade they safeguarded their existing trade.</p>
                        <p>“The specific trade concessions were no more important from a long range
                            view, than the type of agreement that was negotiated and the type of
                            trade policy to which the two Governments committed themselves in this
                            Agreement. It is based on the mutual exchange of most-favored-nation
                            pledges which guarantee that the products of each country should find
                            opportunity in the markets of the other on terms no less favorable than
                            the products of any other country. The underlying meaning of this pledge
                            is a broad one; to wit, that both countries gain reciprocal assurance of
                            both the form and substance of equality of treatment, and that the trade
                            relations between them and the rest of the world may be enabled to
                            develop with that protection.</p>
                        <p>“The Agreement has been operative for almost two years. It was both
                            natural and desirable that advantage be taken by the principals of the
                            Brazilian Mission in this country to review its past operations and its
                            prospects. This has been done in a series of comprehensive discussions
                            in which both countries have freely explained their position and their
                            problems. As these conversations come to an end the two governments
                            declare their intention of continuing the agreement in force and of
                            bending every effort towards the attainment of its objectives.
                            Experience has demonstrated that a number of minor complementary
                            measures are advisable in order to safeguard its principles and benefits
                            in view of the form of trading pursued by some other countries.
                            Accordingly, they undertake to protect these principles and benefits
                            against outside competition that is directly subsidized by
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>“The high convenience was furthermore recognized of the creation of two
                            joint Brazilian-American committees composed of representatives of the
                            trade interests of the two countries. One will be established in Rio de
                            Janeiro, and the other in New York or Washington, with the purpose of
                            studying the best means indicated for developing trade between Brazil
                            and the United States, and of securing, within the commitments mutually
                            entered into by the Government of Brazil <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318"
                                facs="0328"/>and the Government of the United States in the
                            Commercial Agreement of February 2, 1935, the most appropriate solutions
                            in order to overcome the obstacles which might hinder the natural
                            development of trade between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>“These two joint committees will have independent standing, and the
                            obligation of reporting to the two Governments. They will be guided
                            entirely by the wish to foster trade between the two countries. The two
                            Governments are convinced that this innovation in commercial
                            arrangements between the two countries, suggested by the President of
                            Brazil, will provide the basis of experience useful to them both.</p>
                        <p>“The discussion also dealt with certain minor administrative customs
                            regulations, bearing upon the operation of the Agreement. The Brazilian
                            mission has undertaken to give full and prompt study to certain of these
                            regulations with a view towards simplifying or modifying them as may be
                            found necessary. This would complete the substantial improvement of
                            customs administration already made effective by the Brazilian
                            Government.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that, during
                            the course of a recent conversation, the general subject of which was
                            covered in the body of the Embassy’s despatch No. 1306 of March 11,
                                1937,<note n="7" xml:id="d342fn7">Not printed.</note> Dr. G. [<hi
                                rend="italic">J</hi>.] A. Barbosa Carneiro, Chief of the Commercial
                            Section of the Brazilian Foreign Office, called my attention to the fact
                            that the compensation agreement between Brazil and Germany<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d342fn8">Signed June 6, 1936; text in <hi rend="italic"

                            will expire in a few months, and added that the Brazilian Government is
                            studying all phases of the matter carefully in order to decide what
                            action should be taken upon the expiration of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Barbosa Carneiro stated further that he had been informed by the
                            Germans (he did not specify whether by the German Embassy or other
                            German sources) that Aski marks were now being used by Germany in the
                            purchase from the United States of cotton, petroleum and other
                            commodities, with the acquiescence of the appropriate American
                            authorities. He inquired whether this statement was true. <pb n="319"
                                xml:id="pg_319" facs="0329"/>I replied that I should prefer to
                            obtain official information from the Department before answering him
                            definitely, but that it was my impression that the Treasury Department
                            had recently announced that the countervailing duty provisions of the
                            United States tariff laws would not be invoked against certain classes
                            of commercial transactions between Germany and the United States
                            involving the use of Aski marks. I stressed the fact that any such
                            transactions were exceptions and purely private ones between German and
                            American individuals or companies. Dr. Barbosa Carneiro remarked that if
                            transactions with Aski marks were permitted by the United States without
                            penalty, this was of the highest importance to the Brazilian authorities
                            in formulating Brazilian policy as regards trade with Germany. He
                            requested that the Embassy furnish him with definite information
                            concerning this subject as soon as possible. He seemed inclined to
                            belittle the difference between private Aski mark or barter transactions
                            and those sponsored by direct bilateral negotiations between two
                            governments, such as the existing Brazilian-German trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>I based my statement to Dr. Barbosa Carneiro with regard to the nature of
                            Aski mark transactions between the United States and Germany on the
                            summary of the Treasury Department announcement regarding “German Mark
                            Transactions” contained in the Department’s radio bulletin No. 303 of
                            December 24, 1936. The item under the heading “German-American Trading
                            Company”, contained in the Department’s radio bulletin No. 63 of March
                            18, 1937, would seem to indicate that active advantage is being taken of
                            the privileges set forth in the Treasury Department’s announcement, and
                            that they may even have been extended, since it is the Embassy’s
                            understanding that that announcement referred to operations of single
                            American parties with German exporters, without the intervention of
                            third parties, whereas the Continental Export and Import Corporation,
                            mentioned in the item in the later radio bulletin, with its small
                            capitalization, would appear to be more or less of a “middleman”
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is, of course, aware, this Embassy earlier consistently
                            advanced the view in its dealings with the Brazilian authorities that
                            the American Government, as a matter of principle, deplored clearing and
                            compensation agreements and the use of depreciated currencies in
                            international trade as tending to counteract the beneficial effects of
                            its trade agreement policy and its unceasing efforts directed toward the
                            lowering of trade barriers throughout the world. The Embassy pointed out
                            that countervailing duties had been put into effect in the United States
                            on certain imports from Germany because of discrimination by the latter
                            against United States trade involving the subsidizing of German exports
                            by use of the controlled mark system. <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320"
                                facs="0330"/>The fact that such practices were penalized by the
                            United States of course made our position relatively strong in arguing
                            with the Brazilian authorities on a matter of principle.</p>
                        <p>While the general argument is still valid that the entrance by the
                            Government of Brazil into clearing and compensation agreements with
                            other countries goes counter to the intent of the Brazilian-American

                        <p>31. For Assistant Secretary Welles. In conversation yesterday with the
                            Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="12" xml:id="d343fn12">Mario
                                de Pimentel Brandão.</note> the latter informed me that he is urging
                            very strongly upon the President of the Republic the desirability of
                            Brazil not renewing the Brazilian-German compensation arrangement which
                            expires on July 31st next.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is doubtless aware the Acting Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs was consistently opposed to the consummation by Brazil of the
                            compensation arrangement with Germany and I believe that he will
                            sincerely do what he can to prevent the renewal of the arrangement.
                            However since he is lacking in political influence I am not sure that
                            his views will have much weight with the President unless we can do
                            something to strengthen his hand. For this reason I venture to suggest
                            that the Department send him in whatever way seems most <pb n="321"
                                xml:id="pg_321" facs="0331"/>practicable a carefully prepared
                            message recalling Mr. Welles’ conversations with the President and the
                            Ministry of Finance during his visit to Rio de Janeiro and again setting
                            forth in general terms our objections to the Brazilian-German
                            arrangement; stating that we are convinced that the operation of this
                            arrangement which has been in effect now for nearly one year has in fact
                            been harmful to our trade and has practically nullified any benefits
                            which we might have received from the Brazilian-American trade agreement
                            and expressing the hope that Brazil will see fit to allow the
                            arrangement to lapse upon its expiration. I do not think such a message
                            should carry any reference to my conversation yesterday with the Acting
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs. I feel that if the Acting Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs could receive such a private advice at this time signed
                            by the Secretary of State or Mr. Welles which he could show to the
                            President it would lend great weight to his arguments and might prove
                            the deciding factor in persuading the President to allow the agreement
                            to lapse.</p>

                        <p>37. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs requested me to call on him
                            yesterday afternoon. He explained that he had been having frequent talks
                            with the President of the Republic<note n="13" xml:id="d344fn13">Getulio

                            be taken by June 6th as it was signed on June 6th of last year. He added
                            that the President shares his views that Brazil must cooperate more
                            closely with the United States on trade matters and that the President
                            is practically convinced of the desirability of not renewing the
                            agreement with Germany. However he added that he could not say as much
                            for the Minister of Finance<note n="14" xml:id="d344fn14">Arthur de
                                Souza Costa.</note> who, although willing to meet specific
                            objections on the part of the United States, nevertheless looks at this
                            subject from a realistic point of view and believes that the German
                            market is too important for Brazil to lose and that there is only one
                            basis of dealing with Germany at the present time, namely compensation.
                            The Minister of Finance had informed him that he would not be able to
                            discuss this question in detail until May 3rd as he is too busy at the
                            present time with budgetary and other matters. However, he requested the
                            Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to obtain <pb n="322"
                                xml:id="pg_322" facs="0332"/>from the American Embassy a full report
                            voicing American objections to the operation of the Brazilian-German
                            agreement and what we consider to be its effect upon the operation of
                            the Brazilian-American treaty. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            added that in his conversations with the Minister of Finance he would
                            use such a report or not, depending upon the tactics of the Minister of
                            Finance. Should the latter, when he comes to grips with this question,
                            be willing to discuss it on the general principle of Brazilian-American
                            relations it might not be necessary for the Acting Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs to use such a report. However, if, as he expects, the Minister
                            of Finance calls for our definite objections with figures to support the
                            same, it would be most helpful for him to have this report at hand.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs added that the local
                            representative of J. Henry Schroeder Banking Corporation has been
                            bombarding the Minister of Finance and the Federal Foreign Trade Council
                            with clippings from English and American newspapers tending to show that
                            commercial deals in compensation marks between German and American firms
                            are being permitted by the American Government and that this was having
                            its effect upon the Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>I recalled the conversations which Mr. Welles<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d344fn15">Assistant Secretary of State Sumner Welles was a
                                delegate to the Inter-American Conference at Buenos Aires and
                                stopped in Rio de Janeiro on the way back to the United
                                States.</note> had with the Minister of Finance on December 30th at
                            which time the Minister of Finance requested a list of the principal
                            American commodities to be affected by the German compensation trade and
                            explained that a partial list had been made in the Embassy and that Mr.
                            Welles had actually presented it to the Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>I hesitate to take any action upon the request of the Acting Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs without specific instructions from the Department
                            especially as no reply has been received to the Embassy’s despatch No.
                            1319 of March 22nd or telegram No. 31 of April 6, 11 a.m.</p>
                        <p>I feel that if the Department is still convinced of the desirability of
                            Brazil withdrawing from the compensation arrangement with Germany the
                            time to strike has arrived and that the Department should spare no
                            effort to give the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs the material and
                            arguments which he desires in the form suggested in the Embassy’s
                            telegram No. 31, April 6, 11 a.m. The Embassy could supplement such a
                            message with full statistical information which it has now obtained from
                            official Brazilian sources in compliance <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department acknowledges the receipt of
                            your telegram No. 37, of April 23, noon, reporting that the Acting
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs has asked the views of this Government with
                            respect to the renewal of the Brazilian-German Compensation
                            Arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Please say to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that this
                            Government appreciates his request for its views in connection with the
                            renewal of the Brazilian-German Compensation Agreement. This Government
                            believes the cause of liberal commercial policy which both Governments
                            desire to promote is greatly strengthened by such consultation and
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>At the outset this Government desires again to emphasize that it does not
                            seek special protection for American exports from any ordinary
                            competition. The trade agreement between the United States and Brazil is
                            predicated upon and depends for its full validity upon the conduct of
                            trade with all countries on regular lines of economic interchange. The
                            United States in no way wishes to seek a limitation of German-Brazilian
                            trade so long as it is based on these principles and does not subject
                            the trade of other countries such as the United States to exceptional
                            and uneconomic competition. On the contrary, it welcomes the expansion
                            of Brazilian commerce with other countries on a sound economic basis and
                            accordingly hopes that Brazil will endeavor to conclude a trade
                            agreement with Germany based on the liberal principles which Brazil and
                            this Government desire to pursue.</p>
                        <p>This Government has from time to time in recent months brought to the
                            attention of the Brazilian Government the competitive disadvantages to
                            which American trade is subjected by the type of compensation
                            arrangement that has been in force between Brazil and Germany. It has
                            forced a displacement of the trade of the United States and other
                            countries in Brazil, placing at a disadvantage those countries which
                            have arranged their trade relations with Brazil on liberal lines. This
                            result, which tends to follow from the use of blocked currencies which
                            stimulates trade diversion, has been greatly <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324"
                                facs="0334"/>accentuated by the arbitrary system employed by Germany
                            with respect to its exports which disorganizes and renders almost
                            completely uncertain the competition with which American exporters find
                            themselves faced.</p>
                        <p>As a result of conversations held between officers of the two Governments
                            in Rio in December 1936, the United States Government felt that it had
                            reason to hope that the Brazilian Government felt that its own best
                            interests would be served by the elimination of the artificial and
                            illiberal elements in its trade relations with Germany.</p>
                        <p>The forthcoming negotiations offer the opportunity of establishing trade
                            relations with Germany along the sound and advantageous lines of liberal
                            policy which have not yet been realized.</p>
                        <p>By the liberal customs treatment accorded to Brazilian products, Brazil
                            has been enabled to maintain a large and needed export balance with the
                            steadily expanding American market. If, however, American trade
                            continues to be displaced by special and compensated trade, it is plain
                            that the trade agreement with Brazil, assuring the continuance of this
                            liberal treatment, will incur continued criticism in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government has taken action which has resulted in the
                            elimination of these arbitrary elements in its trade with Germany. On
                            June 4, 1936, the Treasury Department of this Government held that
                            export bounties or grants were being paid by the German Government on
                            certain articles of export and that importations of such articles in
                            this country were therefore subject to the countervailing duties
                            prescribed in Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930.<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d345fn17">46 Stat. 590, 687.</note></p>
                        <p>As a result of this act the German Government agreed that after August 2,
                                1936,<note n="18" xml:id="d345fn18">See <ref

                                    210</ref> ff.</note> it would take measures to insure that no
                            scrip or bond procedure would be allowed, no public or private bounty or
                            subsidy would be paid, and that the use of no German currency other than
                            free gold exchange marks or inland marks would be permitted in
                            connection with direct or indirect exports of German merchandise to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing that when normal exchange facilities are restricted there may
                            be some justification for private barter transactions, the position of
                            the Treasury Department above cited has been held not to apply to
                            certain types of such transactions carried through directly by the
                            original shipper of American products to Germany provided no subsidy or
                            price discount is allowed upon the German exports.</p>
                        <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0335"/>
                        <p>It is to be noted that Germany does not apply the principle of
                            compensation and does not use blocked marks in its trade with Panama,
                            Cuba, the Philippine Islands, China, Siam, Egypt, the Sudan, British
                            India, and the Straits Settlements.</p>
                        <p>The fact that in its trade with this and other countries Germany has made
                            exceptions to its regime of compensation trade through the use of
                            blocked marks in payment for German imports and to its practice of
                            paying export bounties leads this Government to make the suggestion
                            that, in place of the present arrangement between Germany and Brazil,
                            there be concluded a trade agreement on liberal lines, providing for
                            merchandise payments in free currencies including reciprocal reductions
                            of tariffs and quantitative restrictions, and especially providing for
                            the elimination of blocked mark and subsidy procedures. This Government
                            understands that the reason invoked for Germany’s policy of compensation
                            trade is the lack of foreign exchange with which to make needed
                            purchases abroad. It would seem that this situation does not obtain as
                            regards commerce between Brazil and Germany since quite apart from such
                            gains as may be due to the system of direct export subsidies there
                            appears to be a regular and apparently substantial demand for German
                            products in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that the Brazilian Government would probably desire to
                            supplement such an agreement with specific undertakings by Germany as to
                            the treatment to be accorded to Brazilian goods under quota and exchange
                            arrangements if it proved impossible to secure an agreement from Germany
                            that no exchange or quantitative restrictions would be imposed on
                            imports from Brazil. In view of the balance of trade between the two
                            countries, this should not prove difficult to obtain.</p>
                        <p>Further, it is felt that both in its own permanent trade interests and in
                            behalf of the maintenance of equitable competitive conditions in Brazil
                            for the trade of all countries, the Brazilian Government should in such
                            a trade agreement seek to discourage subsidized imports, particularly in
                            those lines which are customarily supplied to Brazil by other countries.
                            One method of accomplishing this would be to obtain, as did the United
                            States for its imports, a promise by Germany not to employ its various
                            subsidy procedures on exports to Brazil. Another method would be the
                            imposition of additional duties on subsidized goods in amounts
                            sufficient to offset the subsidies paid or bestowed. Restrictions upon
                            subsidized imports do not prevent private compensation arrangements upon
                            such terms as may be mutually satisfactory but they do assure that there

                            but of decisive effect in the efforts being made to improve

                        <p>54. In a conversation this afternoon with the Acting Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs he informed me that the reaction both of himself and the
                            President to the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> outlined in the
                            Department’s instruction 691 [<hi rend="italic">683</hi>], May 12 and
                            which I left with him on May 22 was extremely favorable. He added that a
                            committee had been set up under his direction to study the whole
                            question and that he had also left a copy with the Minister of Finance
                            but he was not in a position to report the latter’s reaction to it yet.
                            He showed me telegrams from the Brazilian Embassy in Berlin indicating
                            that Germany is worried about the Brazilian situation and is bringing
                            pressure to bear and offering inducements such as increased purchases of
                            tobacco from Rio Grande do Sul in order to bring the Brazilians into
                            line. Although the attitude of the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            was encouraging he did not comment upon any of the specific
                            recommendations embodied in the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> and
                            I think it entirely premature to jump to the conclusion that this
                            favorable attitude will be translated into action along the lines we
                            desire. In fact in a conversation yesterday between the Commercial
                            Attaché and the Chief of the Commercial Section of the Foreign Office
                            the latter who had been studying the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                            advanced certain suggestions which are not yet it is true very concrete
                            but which would entirely fail to meet our views. He also stated that he
                            anticipated considerable opposition from the Minister of Finance and the
                            Exchange Director of the Bank of Brazil to any change in the existing
                            Brazilian-German arrangement. I feel it should be emphasized that the
                            two officials last mentioned have more influence than the Acting
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

                        <p>56. As a result of conversations between Boucas<note n="19"
                                xml:id="d347fn19">Valentim F. Bouças, member of the Brazilian
                                Federal Foreign Trade Council and Special Technical Adviser to the
                                Minister of Finance.</note> and myself this morning and between the
                            Commercial Attaché<note n="20" xml:id="d347fn20">Ralph H.
                                Ackerman.</note> and the Chief of the Commercial Section of the

                                Carneiro.</note> during the weekend, I am very pessimistic as to any
                            action being taken by Brazil along the lines suggested in the <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>. From these conversations it appears
                            that the tremendous pressure which has been brought to bear upon the
                            Minister of Finance and the members of the committee set up to study
                            this question, both from German sources and from Brazilian importers and
                            exporters themselves has had its effect. Boucas stated that the Minister
                            of Finance with whom he has just talked is extremely unfavorable to the
                                <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> and that he will have the
                            deciding voice in this question no matter what the attitude of the
                            Foreign Office may be. Furthermore, in Boucas’ opinion the committee,
                            with the exception of the Foreign Office member, is opposed to our
                            views. The Chief of the Commercial Section of the Foreign Office seemed
                            entirely disposed to attempt to evolve a plan which would meet our views
                            but frankly stated that as yet none had occurred to him which he felt he
                            could induce the opposition to accept nor did he think the suggestions
                            in the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> practicable.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the Minister of Finance the American Chamber of
                            Commerce is preparing a memorandum which will embody the views of
                            American businessmen.</p>
                        <p>Our views set forth in the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> are so
                            clearly expressed that it is difficult for me to make any constructive
                            suggestion to the Department with a view to overcoming the apparent
                            opposition which exists here excepting perhaps a direct appeal to the
                            President.</p>

                        <p>59. Embassy’s telegram 56, June 1, 1 p.m. I called last night at his
                            request upon the Minister of Finance accompanied by Boucas. The Minister
                            informed me that he had received a memorandum from the American Chamber
                            of Commerce as well as our <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> on <pb
                                n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0338"/>the trade arrangement with
                            Germany and that the British had likewise made representations about
                            this subject. As a result of these representations he explained that the
                            German Government was being notified that the present Brazilian-German
                            compensation arrangement would be extended for a period of 3 months
                            during which studies would be made with a view to analyzing our
                            objections. I asked him if this was equivalent to a denouncement of the
                            present arrangement and he said emphatically that it was not; that he
                            saw no reason to denounce the present arrangement. He then added that he
                            felt Brazil must continue to deal with Germany in compensation marks
                            although during the course of the studies about to be undertaken he
                            would attempt to evolve some plan to eliminate “subsidized imports”. I
                            explained that as I understood the situation with respect to Brazil,
                            subsidies on many German exports were granted through the operation of
                            the compensation marks system itself. He thereupon showed me photostat
                            copies of private barter arrangements for the German and American firms
                            which had evidently been furnished him from the source mentioned in the
                            Embassy’s previous telegrams. I explained that these transactions were
                            not made with the compensation mark but were merely barter arrangements
                            and that no price discount or subsidy was involved. The Minister
                            apparently had no conception of this difference and he asked me to
                            secure for him a technical exposé of the system as operated in the
                            United States at the present time. I called his attention to the
                            explanation regarding this point contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> but he asked me to obtain a full exposé regarding
                            it and I trust the Department will furnish it without delay as I am
                            convinced the Minister of Finance is entirely confused regarding this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>He then asked me to see the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs which I
                            did. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed what the Minister
                            of Finance had told me regarding the prolongation for 3 months of the
                            arrangement and stated that the Minister of Finance had desired to
                            prolong it for 1 year and that it was cut down to 3 months only upon the
                            insistence of the Foreign Office. I stated that I was greatly
                            discouraged as the result of my conversation with the Minister of
                            Finance in view of the statement he had made that Brazil must continue
                            with the compensation mark system.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In view of the two conversations reported above I believe our case to be
                            hopeless unless we are willing to use pressure. However, in order to
                            dispel the confusion which apparently exists in the mind of the Minister
                            of Finance I venture to reiterate my request that the Department furnish
                            the Embassy with as complete information as possible as to the actual
                            mechanics of the present barter arrangements <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329"
                                facs="0339"/>which are now permitted between American and German
                            firms (see Embassy’s despatch 1319, March 22nd) and also full
                            information concerning the exact operation of the “subsidy or price
                            discount system” existing in Germany.</p>

                        <p>60. Embassy’s telegram 59. Subsequent to the conversations reported in
                            the telegram under reference Boucas telephoned me and asked my
                            impression of the conversation with the Minister of Finance. I replied
                            that I was extremely disappointed with that conversation. I did this
                            designedly both because it was true [apparent omission] I was convinced
                            that my remarks would be repeated by Boucas to the Minister of
                            Finance.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs asked me to see him. He
                            stated that Boucas had in fact repeated my impressions to the Minister
                            of Finance and that this had had a most “salutary effect”. He added that
                            apparently the Minister of Finance has at last awakened to the
                            realization that he must give this question serious consideration and
                            study. He added that the Minister of Finance had had a long conversation
                            by telephone with Aranha<note n="22" xml:id="d349fn22">Oswaldo Aranha,
                                Brazilian Ambassador to the United States.</note> last night and the
                            two had had a heated discussion, Aranha urging that the Minister of
                            Finance do something along the lines we suggested, et cetera. The net
                            result is that the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs is somewhat more
                            hopeful than yesterday but he urged us in all earnestness to adopt a
                            firm attitude as he felt that the Minister of Finance had until now been
                            seeking not to meet our views but a way to avoid meeting them. This
                            afternoon Boucas informed me that in the telephone conversation last
                            evening between Aranha and the Minister the former urged the latter to
                            come to the United States this month. The Minister is apparently toying
                            with the idea. I feel that it would be an excellent step were the
                            Minister to go to Washington as it would remove him from the insidious
                            influences to which he is especially susceptible and which are working
                            here against American and in favor of German interests and would enable
                            us to present our point of view more forcibly and more fully than can be
                            done here. … I feel further that in any event pressure for a favorable
                            decision on the compensation mark question should be exerted
                            unrelentingly and <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0340"/>that he
                            should under no circumstances be allowed to use the 3 months period
                            merely to put off consideration of the question.</p>

                        <p>The Brazilian Ambassador called to see me to advise me of a telephone
                            conversation which he had had yesterday with his own Minister of Finance
                            and with regard to another conversation which he intended having with
                            him early this afternoon. The Ambassador had been informed that, due to
                            the insistence of President Vargas, the existing commercial agreement
                            between Germany and Brazil had been denounced within the past three days
                            by the Brazilian Government and Germany had been notified that, at the
                            expiration of the ninety-day denunciation period, the treaty would not
                            be renewed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador had been told by the Minister of Finance that there would
                            now appear to be two alternatives as to the policy to be pursued by
                            Brazil: (1) to attempt, during these coming three months, to work out an
                            understanding with Germany which would result in the elimination of all
                            the objectionable articles in the existing agreement, particularly those
                            which were proving detrimental to American trade interests, and then
                            negotiate a new agreement with Germany in this revised form, which will
                            amount to little more than giving Germany a continuation of the
                            most-favored-nation treatment; (2) to abandon the new agreement with
                            Germany entirely.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would like to discuss the questions raised by
                            the first alternative with this Government during the coming weeks, and
                            I said I would be very happy to do so. He asked particularly if we would
                            instruct our own Embassy in Rio to make immediate representations to the
                            Minister of Finance, not based so much on the material loss caused to
                            the commercial interests of the United States by the conditions arising
                            as a result of the present German-Brazilian agreement, but more on the
                            political and moral side, namely, that we had first negotiated a trade
                            agreement with Brazil under this Administration, that we had looked to
                            Brazil to support our liberal trade policy in the rest of the world, and
                            that the Brazilian Government, while undoubtedly animated by the best
                            disposition and the most friendly spirit, had nevertheless on repeated
                            occasions let us down because, due to certain temporary exigencies,
                            special agreements with Germany and Italy<note n="23" xml:id="d350fn23"

                                    247</ref> ff.</note> had seemed momentarily advantageous. I told
                            the Ambassador that we would be happy to do so.</p>

                        <p>I then took occasion to ask the Ambassador to read the <hi rend="italic"

                            calling the attention of the Brazilian Government to the clearing
                            arrangement between Italy and Brazil effected by an agreement signed by
                            the Bank of Brazil and the Italian National Institute for Exchange
                            Abroad on February 15, 1937. I said that it was clear that the agreement
                            referred to was in very definite contravention of the assurances
                            officially given us by the Brazilian Government on July 17<note n="25"

                            me that no general agreement had been entered into; that he had happened
                            to be in Rio on February 15 and that he had been informed on that day
                            that this agreement envisaged solely the purchase by Brazil of three
                            Italian submarines and the method of providing compensation therefor. At
                            my request, he said, however, that he would ask full information and
                            advise me accordingly.</p>
                        <p>I then asked the Ambassador if he had any further word on the Central
                            Bank proposal, and he said that he would talk about this matter with the
                            Minister of Finance by telephone this afternoon and advise me of the
                            intentions of his Government.</p>
                        <p>I advised the Ambassador of the President’s approval of the proposed
                            contract for the leasing of United States destroyers to Brazil<note

                                ff.</note> and stated that, as soon as the three points concerning
                            which the Navy Department and this Department were still in disaccord
                            were agreed upon, which I hoped would be in the immediate future, I
                            would advise him accordingly.</p>

                            Aranha has communicated to me the statements made to him by telephone by
                            the Minister of Finance which would appear to be completely at variance
                            with the statements which the latter made to you. Aranha has likewise
                            shown to me the personal letter he has sent to President Vargas which
                            conveys very fully and emphatically the point of view of this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In view of the evident confusion which exists, the visit here of the
                            Minister of Finance and of his associates will undoubtedly be highly
                            beneficial. When an appropriate opportunity presents itself, please
                            advise the Minister of Finance of the pleasure it will give the

                        <p>67. For the Under Secretary. In a conversation with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs<note n="29" xml:id="d354fn29">Mario de Pimentel Brandão,
                                Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> last night the latter
                            informed me of the receipt by the President of a letter from Aranha
                            reporting a conversation with Mr. Welles and stating that the latter had
                            taken a firm stand and had called Aranha’s attention to the preferential
                            treatment given by Argentina to the British, although Great Britain did
                            not accord to Argentina the same favorable treatment which the United
                            States extended to Brazil and that Mr. Welles felt that on account of
                            the political relations between the United States and Brazil the latter
                            should be willing to extend better treatment to the United States than
                            is accorded at present. The letter mentioned above is probably the one
                            referred to in the Department’s 36.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs added that he considered Mr. Welles to
                            be “absolutely right” in his stand and that just before the Minister of
                            Finance departed he, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, had again
                            endeavored to impress upon him that because of the political relations
                            between the two countries he should be willing to waive the immediate
                            material benefits which Brazil derived from the present arrangement with
                            Germany. He added that Souza Costa had replied that the political side
                            of the question did not interest him and that he was only interested in
                            the material side. He then added that he was convinced that the attitude
                            of the Minister of Finance in the forthcoming negotiations in Washington
                            would depend largely upon the degree of firmness with which he was
                            treated by the State Department. He said that he was convinced Souza
                            Costa would endeavor in every way to secure our consent to a renewal of
                            the agreement with Germany with possibly some slight concessions to us.
                            He felt that if our stand was firm, however, Brazil would do away with
                            this agreement.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Brazil came in and presented the Brazilian Minister of
                            Finance, Mr. Arthur de Souza Costa, Mr. Boucas and Mr. Barbosa Carneiro.
                            They called primarily to pay their respects and, incidentally, to
                            indicate to me that the chief purpose of their trip was simply to clear
                            up the slightest misapprehensions or misunderstandings in connection
                            with the carrying forward of the broad general economic program. I
                            expressed much gratification at this and at the disposition of the
                            Brazilian Government to do full teamwork with us in support of this
                            program. I said that the fact that they had come this distance in order
                            to clarify any phase of the movement which might obstruct the fullest
                            measure of teamwork between the two countries was a sufficient assurance
                            that Brazil would do her full part. I then elaborated on the usual
                            viewpoints which most strongly support our program and make it most
                            appealing, both from the broad and the narrower standpoint, to countries
                            like Brazil.</p>

                            course of recent discussions of questions arising in connection with the

                            countries. These questions have been the subject of several conferences
                            participated in by myself, the Minister of Finance of Brazil, Mr. Arthur
                            de Souza Costa and the Chief of the Commercial Service of the Ministry
                            of Foreign Affairs, Mr. J. A. Barboza Carneiro, not only with Your
                            Excellency but also with various other officials of the Department of

                            <item>In the course of these conferences it was made perfectly clear
                                that the Brazilian Government, like the Government of the United
                                States, keenly desires that the aforesaid Agreement of February 2,
                                1935, shall continue to be fully executed both in letter and in
                                spirit.</item>

                            <item>The situation presented by the conduct of international trade in
                                compensation currencies was carefully examined, and it was made
                                clear that the Brazilian Government keenly desires that its import
                                trade shall rest upon the basis of fair competition. Having regard
                                to this, my Government will use every effort to assure that those
                                goods imported into Brazil which may compete with the American
                                products covered by our Trade Agreement shall not be favored by any
                                direct subsidy from the Government of exporting countries.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>In correspondence with its belief that international trade will
                                develop most substantially and with the greatest economic and other
                                benefits on the basis of equality and through the medium of free
                                currencies, the Brazilian Government made it clear that it regards
                                trade through compensation currencies as being a contingency which
                                it desires to discourage as soon as may be possible. In view of
                                this, the Brazilian Government intends that trade through
                                compensating procedures, being susceptible of creating a situation
                                which introduces difficulty into the trade with countries having a
                                regime of currency of free international circulation, should be so
                                regulated as to prevent the dislocation of trade with the countries
                                carried out in free currencies and on a basis of equality. This
                                would serve to maintain the effectiveness of commercial agreements
                                based on the principle of equality of opportunity.</item>

                            <item>Furthermore, it was recognized to be highly desirable to create
                                two Brazilian-American mixed commissions composed of representatives
                                of the commercial interests of the two countries, one in Rio de
                                Janeiro, the other in New York, the purpose of which would be the

                            receipt of Your Excellency’s note of July 14, 1937, in which you recite
                            the conclusions reached in the course of recent discussions of questions
                            arising in connection with the execution of the Trade Agreement of
                            February 2, <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0346"/>1935, between our
                            two countries. These questions were examined in several conferences
                            participated in by Your Excellency, the Minister of Finance of Brazil,
                            Mr. Arthur de Souza Costa and the Chief of the Commercial Service of the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. J. A. Barboza Carneiro, various
                            officials of the Department of State and myself.</p>
                        <p>The agreements reached and the undertakings decided upon in these
                            conferences, which you confirm in your note under acknowledgment, are
                            very gratifying to this Government.</p>
                        <p>This Government notes with pleasure, in paragraph 2 of your note, that
                            the Brazilian Government, like the Government of the United States,
                            keenly desires that the aforesaid Agreement of February 2, 1935, shall
                            continue to be fully executed both in letter and spirit.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the situation presented by the conduct of international
                            trade in compensation currencies which was carefully examined in the
                            course of the recent conferences, this Government welcomes Your
                            Excellency’s statement that the Brazilian Government keenly desires that
                            its import trade shall rest upon the basis of fair competition, and Your
                            Excellency’s assurance that the Brazilian Government will use every
                            effort to assure that those goods imported into Brazil which may compete
                            with the American products covered by our Trade Agreement shall not be
                            favored by any direct subsidy from the Government of exporting
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>My Government also notes that the Brazilian Government, in accordance
                            with its belief that international trade will develop most substantially
                            and with the greatest economic and other benefits on the basis of
                            equality and through the medium of free currencies, regards trade
                            through compensation currencies as being a contingency which it desires
                            to discourage. My Government is in full agreement with this belief and
                            policy and accordingly notes with gratification the assurance in Your
                            Excellency’s note that the Brazilian Government intends that trade
                            through compensation procedures, being susceptible of creating a
                            situation which introduces difficulty into the trade with countries
                            having a regime of currency of free international circulation, should be
                            so regulated as to prevent the dislocation of trade with the countries
                            carried out in free currencies and on a basis of equality. It shares
                            Your Excellency’s opinion that this action would serve to maintain the
                            effectiveness of commercial agreements based on the principle of
                            equality of opportunity.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the foregoing undertakings of Your Excellency’s
                            Government, I wish to repeat the statements made during the conferences
                            of which Your Excellency’s note recites the conclusions, that this
                            Government does not seek special protection for American exports to
                            Brazil from any fair competition, nor is it advocating a limitation <pb
                                n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0347"/>of such trade as remains open
                            to the competition of all countries, including the United States, on a
                            basis of equal opportunity. The execution of these undertakings of Your
                            Excellency’s Government will serve to bring about these conditions of
                            equality of commercial opportunity and fair competition on the Brazilian
                            market, and will, it is believed, be of advantage not only to the
                            commercial relations of the United States and Brazil but of real and
                            permanent advantage to Brazil and to all countries trading with
                            Brazil.</p>
                        <p>As Your Excellency states, it was recognized during the conferences that
                            it would be highly desirable to create two Brazilian-American mixed
                            commissions composed of representatives of the commercial interests of
                            the two countries, one in Rio de Janeiro, the other in New York, the
                            purpose of which would be the continuous study of the means to increase
                            mercantile transactions between Brazil and the United States, achieving
                            within the mutual obligations assumed by the Government of the United
                            States and by the Government of Brazil in the Trade Agreement of
                            February 2, 1935, the most appropriate solutions to overcome the
                            obstacles which might obstruct the natural development of trade between
                            the two countries. These advisory commissions would from time to time
                            inform the Brazilian and American authorities of their work.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I desire to express the satisfaction of this Government at
                            the opportunity afforded to consult with respect to the economic
                            relations of our two countries with the high officials of the Brazilian
                            Government composing the financial commission. The frankness and
                            sympathetic understanding of this Government’s viewpoint which Your
                            Excellency and the members of the commission brought to the discussions,
                            were greatly appreciated.</p>

                        <p>112. The Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="30" xml:id="d359fn30">Mario
                                de Pimentel Brandão, who had been Acting Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs since January 1937, was appointed Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs by presidential decree of September 1, 1937.</note> last
                            evening spoke to me about the termination of the German agreement on
                            September 5 and said that the Minister of Finance desires to replace the
                            provisional agreement by a definite arrangement for a period of one
                            year. This arrangement would differ from the previous one in that the
                            amounts of coffee and cotton which Brazil may export to Germany,
                            receiving <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0348"/>payment in
                            compensation marks, would be limited not only by volume but by value.
                            The Minister of Finance does not consider it necessary to include any
                            other commodities in the treaty, because the other Brazilian exports to
                            Germany are negligible (and also because he desires to avoid whenever
                            possible domestic political opposition).</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs then said that he does not agree with
                            this but believes that the arrangement should be extended for a period
                            of only 6 months, limiting coffee and cotton exports as proposed by the
                            Minister of Finance, and during the 6 months period draw up a schedule
                            of all the other Brazilian exports to Germany with a view to making at
                            the end of the 6 months period a definite schedule of all Brazilian
                            exports to Germany, limiting the same both as to volume and value.</p>
                        <p>(As the Department is aware, although amounts were fixed in the last
                            arrangement with Germany, valuation was not included and during the
                            period of 12 months the value of the exports rose greatly, although the
                            volume did not, resulting, of course, in a marked increase in the
                            quantity of bloc marks in the Banco do Brazil.)</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that I would endeavor to
                            ascertain immediately the Department’s opinion. (Having in mind the
                            prominence hitherto played by the Brazilian Ambassador at Washington in
                            these negotiations, it is my opinion that it will be well to obtain his
                            views). I invited attention to the promise in the Aranha letter of July
                            14 to the Department to protect our commodities against subsidized
                            imports from Germany. The Foreign Office assured me that an article will
                            be included in whatever arrangement is made to take care of this.</p>
                        <p>As the Embassy has frequently pointed out of late (and this was
                            emphasized yesterday at the Foreign Office), the Germans are bringing
                            all possible pressure upon the Minister of Finance to extend the
                            previous arrangement for a 12 months period with no limitations
                            whatsoever. (I emphasize that the present arrangement expires on
                            September 5 next).</p>

                        <p>51. Your 112, August 31, 1 p.m. The Department does not care to comment
                            directly on specific details of a German-Brazilian commercial agreement.
                            When the Brazilian mission was here, common understanding was firmly
                            established that this Government does not seek in any way a limitation
                            of trade between Brazil and Germany <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"
                                facs="0349"/>which is conducted on lines of sound and normal
                            economic competition; that Brazil, no less than the United States, will
                            seek to discourage and restrict, so far as possible, the various
                            arbitrary trade control devices; and that it will, on a non-preferential
                            basis, endeavor to safeguard the principles and benefits of the trade
                            agreement with the United States. The particular means of achieving
                            these objectives are properly matters for the decision of Brazilian
                            authorities. Within these limits the following comments of a general
                            nature seem pertinent.</p>
                        <p>1. The Department places the utmost importance upon the assurance
                            conveyed to you by the Foreign Office that an article will be included
                            in whatever arrangement is concluded to take care of the problem of
                            German subsidization. Whatever the type of action envisaged, the
                            Department trusts that it will be both specific and comprehensive.</p>
                        <p>2. This Government does not feel that it should discuss the details of
                            the measures to be taken to regulate compensation trading. Whether the
                            desired regulations should be effected by export quotas or by some other
                            method is a matter for the Brazilian Government to determine. Presumably
                            the objective of restriction of trade in compensation currencies would
                            be the prevention of the accumulation of blocked currencies to an extent
                            which would tend artificially to stimulate imports from the country in
                            which payments are blocked in order to liquidate blocked balances or to
                            forestall further accumulation.</p>
                        <p>This Government anticipates, however, that whatever measures are decided
                            upon, the proposed agreement with Germany will be so framed as to enable
                            Brazil fully to comply with the assurance given in the note from the
                            Brazilian Ambassador of July 15 [<hi rend="italic">14</hi>], namely: “…
                            the Brazilian Government intends that trade through compensating
                            procedures, being susceptible of creating a situation which introduces
                            difficulty into the trade with countries having a regime of currency of
                            free international circulation, should be so regulated as to prevent the
                            dislocation of trade with the countries carried out in free currencies
                            and on a basis of equality.”</p>
                        <p>3. In view of the continuing upward trend in international trade and in
                            world prices, it is to be hoped that the world may witness a steady
                            decline in those devices, such as compensation arrangements, quotas,
                            etc., which have been defended on grounds of necessity. For this reason,
                            a short period for an arrangement embodying such devices, even though
                            for the purpose of limiting them, would afford an earlier opportunity
                            for again examining its operation with a view to determining whether a
                            further advance may not be made toward more liberal and normal trade
                            relations. This Government again wishes to express to the Government of
                            Brazil the hope that it may prove possible at an early date for that
                            country to lay the basis for increased, rather than stabilized or
                            decreased, trade with Germany along lines of normal economic
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>The general views of the Department as above outlined were set forth to
                            the Brazilian Ambassador yesterday. The Ambassador stated <pb n="340"
                                xml:id="pg_340" facs="0350"/>in the most emphatic terms his
                            confidence in the Minister of Finance and in his judgment in this
                            matter. He stated that the Minister, because of his visit to Washington,
                            must understand much more clearly than the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            the objectives of the conversations held here. He felt sure that the
                            Minister of Finance would act in the best of faith. With regard to the
                            question whether the agreement should run 6 months or a year the
                            Ambassador stated as his personal opinion that it would not be practical
                            to limit the duration to less than a crop year.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador states he has cabled the Minister of Finance suggesting he
                            get in touch with you in the matter.</p>

                        <p>115. My telegram No. 112.<note n="31" xml:id="d362fn31">August 31, 1

                            Foreign Affairs tells me this evening that owing to pressure from German
                            and interested Brazilian sources he has been compelled to give up his
                            idea of a 6 months’ agreement. He now agrees with the Minister of
                            Finance.</p>
                        <p>The proposed quotas follow: Coffee, 1,000,000 bags valued at 196,000
                            contos, as against 1,128,000 bags valued at 184,000 contos in 1936;
                            cotton, 62,000 tons valued at 248,000 contos, as against 41,403 tons
                            valued at 194,980 contos in 1936 (all other products exported last year
                            amounted to 266,620 contos comprising 27 items, no single item being
                            more than 7% of the total exportation). A definite commitment will be
                            obtained from Germany against any direct subsidy in their exports to
                            Brazil. The Minister remarked that it had been his intention to give
                            this information to the German Chargé d’Affaires <pb n="341"
                                xml:id="pg_341" facs="0351"/>tonight. He has now promised to delay
                            doing it. An expression of the Department’s opinion in the premises will
                            be helpful to me.</p>

                        <p>53. Your telegram 115, September 2, 1 [<hi rend="italic">10</hi>] p.m.
                            The Department notes with gratification that a definite commitment will
                            be obtained from Germany against any direct subsidy in exports to
                            Brazil. Will this commitment be a part of the published agreement?</p>
                        <p>As stated in its telegram no. 51 of September 2, 6 p.m., the Department
                            does not desire to comment directly on specific details of the proposed
                            German-Brazilian commercial agreement. It feels constrained, however, to
                            state that, according to statistical material in your telegram it
                            appears that the proposed Brazilian export quotas to Germany provide for
                            an increase of compensation trade rather than a limitation of such
                            trade. Accordingly, unless there should occur a considerable increase in
                            Brazilian demand and purchasing power for foreign goods, it would seem
                            that Brazil under these quota commitments would not be complying with
                            the assurance given in the note from the Brazilian Ambassador in
                            Washington of July 15 [<hi rend="italic">14</hi>], 1937, namely, that
                            compensation trade “should be so regulated as to prevent the dislocation
                            of trade with the countries carried out in free currencies and on a
                            basis of equality”. Accordingly, the Department inquires whether the
                            proposed trade agreement will carry a provision for its modification if
                            its actual operation should result in accumulating blocked balances in
                            Germany which would tend artificially to stimulate Brazilian imports
                            from that country.</p>

                        <p>116. I saw the Minister of Finance at noon today and discussed with him
                            the German situation along the lines of the Department’s telegrams 51
                            and 53. He stated that I would be shown this afternoon a copy of the
                            proposed note to the German Chargé d’Affaires. He added that in
                            compliance with a conversation he had in Washington with the Under
                            Secretary of State, he would take steps to have 35% of the official
                            exchange involved removed from the free market and <pb n="342"
                                xml:id="pg_342" facs="0352"/>set aside by the Banco do Brazil to be
                            used for purchases by the Federal Government of articles not competing
                            with our exports. He emphasized that this was highly confidential. He
                            remarked also that in his opinion the success or failure of this whole
                            undertaking would depend upon the manner in which the joint committees
                            which are to be appointed carry out their functions. He believes that
                            these committees should be appointed without further delay.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon I discussed also the whole matter with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs. He handed me (in confidence of course) a copy of the
                            proposed note to the German Embassy. He asked me to let him have my
                            comments thereon on Monday. I explained to him why that was impossible.
                            He then said that he would notify the Germans that their agreement had
                            been extended for a few days and hoped I would let him have my comments
                            as soon as possible. I am transmitting a translation of the note in a

                        <p>54. Your telegrams Nos. 116 and 117, September 4 and September 5.<note
                                n="33" xml:id="d365fn33">No. 117, September 5, not printed.</note>
                            The Department has read with interest the proposed Brazilian note to
                            Germany with regard to the extension of the German-Brazilian trade
                            arrangement. The Department notes with gratification that the Brazilian
                            Government will receive from the German Government assurances that no
                            article of German manufacture destined for importation into Brazil will
                            be subsidized by the German Government. When you discuss this with the
                            Brazilian Government the Department believes it will be useful for you
                            to bring out clearly the fact that this protection against subsidy as
                            phrased in the agreement could easily be nullified by special and
                            indirect arrangements. It therefore hopes that the Brazilian Government
                            will make clear to the German authorities its understanding that
                            circumventing measures will not be employed. The Department understands
                            that the maintenance of close watch on this point will be one of the
                            duties of the Joint Committees.</p>
                        <p>With reference to point 9<note n="34" xml:id="d365fn34">This point
                                related to a balance between German exports to Brazil and Brazilian
                                exports to Germany and proposed that, in case the balance was upset,
                                the two Governments should confer regarding measures to restore the
                                equilibrium.</note> of the proposed note, the Department would
                            welcome assurances that this article will not operate to increase <pb
                                n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0353"/>compensation trade in a way
                            that will dislocate trade carried on in free currencies. In case
                            Brazilian exports to Germany should exceed the latter’s exports to
                            Brazil and Brazil, under this article, should act to restore the balance
                            by reducing the quotas of Brazilian export products which may be sold
                            for verrechnung marks such action would be in consonance with the
                            Brazilian Government’s assurance that it intends to regulate
                            compensation trade in order “to prevent the dislocation of trade with
                            the countries carried out in free currencies and on a basis of
                            equality”. If, on the other hand, the measures taken to restore
                            equilibrium were the artificial stimulation of Brazilian purchases of
                            German goods through some action by the Brazilian Government such as
                            lowering the exchange value of the verrechnung mark by action of the
                            Banco do Brasil or by Government purchases or Government influencing of
                            private purchases of German goods, such a solution would dislocate trade
                            with free currency countries.</p>
                        <p>In case German exports to Brazil should exceed Brazilian exports to
                            Germany, it would seem that Brazil would be in a favorable position to
                            induce Germany to cease trading with Brazil on a compensation basis
                            (through verrechnung marks) and abandon or lighten her exchange and
                            quantitative restrictions on imports from Brazil since the only
                            alternatives would apparently be for Brazil either to block payments for
                            imports from Germany which were in excess of Brazilian exports to that
                            country or to apply quantitative restrictions on imports from Germany in
                            order to bring the compensation trade into balance.</p>
                        <p>Souza Costa talked with Aranha by telephone yesterday and assured him of
                            his determination to adopt whatever measures are necessary to put into
                            effect the assurances exchanged here. Please express to Souza Costa the

                        <p>118. Department’s telegram No. 54, September 9, 6 p.m. While I concur
                            that point 8 in the Brazilian note to the German Chargé d’Affaires does
                            not envisage a protection against “special and indirect arrangements”,
                            the agreement arrived at with the Department, according <pb n="344"
                                xml:id="pg_344" facs="0354"/>to paragraph 3 of Aranha’s letter of
                            July 14th, only mentions “direct” subsidy. This appears to be in
                            accordance with the points brought out on pages 7 and 8 of the
                            confidential report of the Brazilian Mission forwarded to the Department

                        <p>55. Your 118, September 10, noon. The Department does not desire to ask
                            the Brazilian Government in this instance to go further than what was
                            agreed upon in the discussions in Washington in July. It believes,
                            however, that it is neither in the interest nor is it the intention of
                            the Brazilian Government to permit a commitment by the German Government
                            to refrain from direct subsidies of exports to be nullified by
                            circumventing arrangements which might not fall strictly within the
                            definition of “direct subsidies”. The Department believes that the
                            Minister of Finance is in accord with this position which formed the
                            basis of the whole discussions in Washington dealing with this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Department believes that you will not encounter any
                            misunderstanding when you present this matter to the Brazilian
                            Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to recent correspondence
                            regarding the German compensation mark matter, and especially to my
                            telegram No. 118, September 10, I have the honor to report that the
                            Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me some time ago that
                            the revised edition of the note, embodying the suggestions I made to
                            him, had been duly transmitted to the German Chargé d’Affaires. However,
                                <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0355"/>he knows that the German
                            authorities object to making the desired promises in regard to
                            subsidies.</p>
                        <p>The German Embassy, of course, is in communication with Berlin on the
                            matter; but it is the Minister’s opinion that the Chargé d’Affaires will
                            endeavor to postpone a final decision until the new German Ambassador
                            arrives. Sr. Pimentel Brandão has assured me that it is not his
                            intention to allow the matter to drift indefinitely.</p>

                            upon German exports are paid from a fund which is contributed, in the
                            form of voluntary self-aid, by German industries. In this sense it may
                            be nominally true that the German Government is not granting subsidies
                            on exports. There can be no doubt, however, that contributions are in
                            fact obligatory and that the organization administering distributions
                            from this fund is under full control of agencies of the German
                            Government and that its decisions are dictated by German Government
                            policy. The ability of the German Government to assume responsibility
                            for the administration of so-called private subsidies is clearly
                            evidenced by the assurances which that Government gave to this
                            Government last year that no public or private subsidies would be paid
                            with respect to German exports to the United States.</p>
                        <p>You may say that the Department had in mind the foregoing system of
                            subsidies and discussed it with members of the Brazilian Financial
                            Mission in the conversations leading up to the agreement embodied in the
                            exchange of notes last July. It is the view of this Government that the
                            subsidization of exports by any organization, with the approval of and
                            subject to the control of the German Government, <pb n="346"
                                xml:id="pg_346" facs="0356"/>cannot be distinguished in its
                            disadvantageous effects upon the export trade of other countries from
                            direct governmentally bestowed subsidies and is as inconsistent as any
                            other form of subsidy with the objectives of the conversations and the
                            exchange of notes of last summer.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to ask the Foreign Minister whether the assurances
                            given in the German counter proposal in regard to direct subsidies are
                            to be construed as covering bounties and subsidies paid by organizations
                            functioning under or in close cooperation with the German
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>It is also observed that although the German Government undertakes to
                            declare that it does not intend to pay subsidies in the future on
                            exports to Brazil, this is only a statement of intention as of the
                            present moment, and that there is explicit statement that the German
                            Government cannot assume the contractual obligation not to take such
                            measures in the future if it should regard them as necessary to restore
                            competitive balance. The proposed German formula thus lacks the binding
                            character of the promise given to the United States in 1936.</p>
                        <p>You should inquire, therefore, whether under the proposed agreement the
                            Brazilian Government will reserve full freedom of action to comply with
                            its commitments to the United States as regards subsidized competition
                            in the event that the German Government should depart from its announced
                            intention not to subsidize exports.</p>
                        <p>Please report by telegraph the results of your conversation.</p>

                            further consideration of the German note of October 18, the Department
                            has difficulty in understanding the purport of the sentence reading,
                            “Brazil, during the life of the agreement, will not take steps by which

                        <p>173. Department’s 66, November 3, 8 p.m. The Foreign Office handed me
                            yesterday the new formula quoted below which it proposes <pb n="348"
                                xml:id="pg_348" facs="0358"/>to embody in the arrangement with
                            Germany (item No. 8 of the German counter-proposal transmitted in my
                            dispatch No. 108 of October 23)<note n="39" xml:id="d373fn39">Not
                                printed.</note> which it hopes will meet our views regarding the
                            question of subsidies and which it believes the Germans will also
                            accept. The Foreign Office points out that the phraseology affords full
                            opportunity for future protests on our part or on the part of Brazil in
                            case we feel that Germany is attempting to use circumventing measures.
                            Furthermore, the Minister of Finance contends that this formula goes
                            much farther than the assurance mentioned in point 3 of Aranha’s letter
                            of July 14. The text of the draft formula follows: <quote

                                    is obliged to do so because of changed competitive conditions in
                                    the Brazilian and German markets, respectively, of imported

                            who, it is feared, will be very “intransigent”.</p>

                        <p>87. Your 173, November 23, 1 p.m. Please see Brazilian authorities at
                            once and say that the suggested formula does not appear adequately to
                            fulfill the commitment of the Brazilian Government to the United States
                            with respect to competition of subsidized exports in the Brazilian
                            market on commodities dealt with in the Brazilian-American trade
                            agreement, and hence would not adequately protect the results of that
                            agreement against possible displacement of American trade as a result of
                            the use of subsidies. By the formula, each Government undertakes not to
                            subsidize exports until such time as it shall determine that competitive
                            conditions in the other country have changed because of measures adopted
                            by other countries. It does not appear on the face of the text that the
                            importing country assumes any responsibility or retains any right to
                            participate in or to protest against the other’s decision that
                            conditions have changed for the stated reasons. The phrase regarding
                            change of competitive conditions is so vague that the interested circles
                            here would no doubt regard the formula as affording no real assurance
                            against unfair German competition during the life of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Suggest that this unsatisfactory situation could be corrected by adding
                            the following sentence to the formula: “In no event will either country
                            engage in or permit any subsidization of exports in the trade between
                            them which would impair or contravene any international obligation or
                            assurance of the importing country”.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 87 of November 24, 2 p.m., suggesting an
                            addition to the formula that the Foreign Office proposed to embody in
                            the arrangement to be consummated with Germany. The Foreign Office now
                            advises me that conversations will shortly ensue with the newly arrived
                            German Ambassador, and it is expected that the arrangement with Germany
                            will be consummated in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Referring specifically to the Department’s suggestion, the Foreign Office
                            indicates that while it does not believe that it will be possible to
                            secure the consent of the Germans to follow the exact text proposed <pb
                                n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0360"/>by the Department, it probably
                            will be possible to obtain the inclusion of a sentence which will meet
                            the Department’s views and which will run somewhat as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In no event will either country engage in or permit any
                                    subsidization of exports in the trade between them which would
                                    impair or contravene any international obligation or officially
                                    known assurance of the importing country.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office explained that the words “officially known” were
                            intended to refer to the letter dated July 14th from the Brazilian
                            Ambassador at Washington to the Department. The Foreign Office added
                            that it sees no objection to the publication of this letter, and assumes
                            that the Department will not object to it either.</p>

                                <p>The Council has noted press comment to the effect that Brazil is

                        <p>78. Your 155, November 12, 2 p.m. Continue to impress on the Brazilian
                            authorities the very serious nature of the reaction to debt suspension.
                            London suspended all trading in Brazilian loans, Paris bourse took no
                            official action but there were actual dealings in only one issue, with
                            no bids in others, New York quotations shrunk nearly 30 percent. It
                            would be most regrettable if these reactions to the first announcement
                            should be allowed to harden into permanent adverse opinion in the great
                            financial markets of the world and in the wider circles of the general
                            public. The Brazilian action is also important as a regression from the
                            general movement of recovery and stabilization of international
                            financial relationships. You should urge the promptest possible
                            consideration of this question with a view to doing whatever can be done
                            to lessen the regrettable effects of the new default and to repair the
                            damage already done.</p>

                        <p>80. Your 162, November 13. Recent developments make it possible that the
                            controversies arising over Brazilian foreign debt may have most
                            widespread disturbing effects, including potential controversies between
                            the governments of creditor countries as to the treatment of bondholders
                            of their respective nationalities. The Embassy in Paris advised the
                            Department that the French Government may insist that service be
                            continued and that if necessary to achieve this end the French
                            Government would intervene to prevent the importation into France of
                            Brazilian coffee. In response to the Embassy’s request for information
                            which might be communicated to the French Government, the Department is
                            cabling as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    that the announcement of the Brazilian President of suspension
                                    of debt service was a distinct surprise. Upon this announcement
                                    the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council in New York made a
                                    vigorous protest in behalf of the holders of dollar bonds. The
                                    Department has asked its Ambassador to seek clarification of the
                                    situation and to use its good offices to make clear to the
                                    Brazilian Government the desirability of avoiding interruption
                                    of debt service, on the ground that it would be regrettable if
                                    Brazil thereby impaired its credit standing in the great
                                    financial markets of the world.</p>
                                <p>For your own information, Department would greatly regret if by
                                    this prospective action Brazil gravely prejudiced its credit
                                    standing and impaired its financial relationships in this
                                    country, Great Britain and France, both because of the economic
                                    and other indirect effects. It therefore will continue by all
                                    appropriate means, and wholly without threat of coercive
                                    measures, to seek to convince the Brazilian Government <pb

                                    continue some measure of debt service. Both the Council and the
                                    Department necessarily could only put forward the interests of
                                    the holders of the dollar bonds, but the Department will seek in
                                    every way to avoid sponsoring measures discriminatory in
                                    character as between investors of different nationalities.</p>
                                <p>Correspondingly, it would be regrettable if the French Government
                                    were to try to impose measures on Brazil which involve terms for
                                    the French bondholders that Brazil was not in a position to
                                    extend to bondholders of all nationalities, and thereby create a
                                    potential controversy over discrimination which would redound to
                                    the disadvantage of investors of all nationalities.”</p>

                            announce that it would appoint a commission to get in touch at once with
                            the representatives of the bondholders in the different countries, and
                            to explain to them fully Brazil’s economic situation with the view of
                            arriving at new agreements for the handling of the debt in accordance

                        <p>81. Department’s 80, November 16, 2 p.m. The French Foreign Office has
                            been informed by the British Foreign Office that on November 15 the
                            Brazilian Government informed the British Embassy that it had decided
                            not to interrupt debt service and that the Government would appoint a
                            committee to examine the situation and to enter into negotiations with
                            the foreign bondholders. The French Foreign Office is advising the
                            French Embassy at Rio de Janeiro of this information and instructing it
                            to obtain the same assurances from the Brazilian Government.</p>

                            Government? Will early announcement on the subject be made for the equal

                        <p>167. Department’s 80, November 16, 2 p.m. and 81, November 17, 4 p.m. As
                            pointed out in my telegram No. 162, November 13, 11 p.m., the President,
                            after my conversation with him, that day authorized the December
                            payments thereby avoiding an interruption in the debt service. The
                            Government has not (yet) considered appointing a committee to conduct
                            negotiations. The Minister of Foreign Affairs says that the Minister of
                            Finance stands ready to enter into negotiations with the foreign
                            bondholders. In the case of American bondholders he assumes that the
                            negotiations already under way will be continued through Boucas (who has
                            been keeping the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council currently
                            informed). The Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasized that it is not
                            the Government’s intention to take any unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>On November 15 the Minister for Foreign Affairs in my presence informed
                            the British Ambassador that the President has authorized the December
                            payments (as I reported November 13) and that the Government stood ready
                            to enter into negotiations with interested parties.</p>
                        <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0366"/>
                        <p>The Minister quite obviously did not care to commit himself yet as to a
                            public announcement on the subject and I shall take this matter up with
                            him again later.</p>

                        <p>168. Referring to Department’s 81 November 17, 4 p.m. and to my 167
                            November 17, 8 p.m. The confused situation regarding the intentions of
                            the Brazilian Government as regards the debt situation arises from the
                            fact that, although the President announced in his speech of November 10
                            his intention to suspend debt payments (in effect offering the nation 45
                            millions a year), my efforts were successful in persuading him to change
                            his policy, at least to the extent of authorizing the December payments,
                            thereby preventing an immediate interruption of the debt service. It is
                            obviously difficult for him, in the face of his original statement, to
                            make a public announcement at the present time indicating so early a
                            change of policy. In fact from conversations I am convinced that the
                            Government itself has not yet decided upon a definite line of action.
                            Obviously at some date in the near future an announcement will have to
                            be made to clarify the situation and I will not fail to continue to urge
                            this necessity in the proper quarters.</p>

                            could not come to Washington because of a previous engagement with the
                            mission from the City of Danzig); it was therefore agreed that the
                            beginning of discussion should be postponed until Mr. Clark,<note n="48"
                                xml:id="d389fn48">J. Reuben Clark, Jr., President of the Foreign
                                Bondholders Protective Council, Inc.</note> who is now in Utah,
                            could come to Washington, which according to Mr. Clark’s present
                            schedule would have been some time next week. After discussion it was
                            decided that I should inform Mr. White that the protraction of delay was
                            greatly to be regretted because the Ambassador would have to leave
                            shortly for Brazil, and that Sunday would be a good day for the
                            Ambassador, and that therefore I should ask Mr. White to inquire of Mr.
                            Clark whether he could hasten his return and meet with the Ambassador on
                            Sunday. (This I did subsequently.)</p>
                        <p>A general discussion regarding the possible bases of discussion with the
                            Council ensued. The Ambassador stated that he thought Souza Costa, the
                            Minister of Finance, was making a special effort to resume some payment
                            on the American debt. But he also was strongly of the opinion that the
                            only form of settlement that would interest the Brazilian authorities
                            would be a permanent settlement which would result in one new type of
                            Brazilian security to be exchanged for all types of dollar securities.
                            The Ambassador argued that this would be to American advantage since the
                            American holdings of Brazilian state and city loans were so much greater
                            proportionately than the American holdings of Federal loans. He brought
                            out the fact that Argentina had sustained full payment on its Federal
                            loans while the provinces had gone into default.</p>
                        <p>I merely stated that I could not talk for the Council, that I assumed the
                            Council would be willing to discuss a permanent settlement if the
                            Brazilian authorities were prepared to make an offer which it could
                            recommend as satisfactory to the bondholders as a permanent offer. <pb
                                n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0368"/>I remarked that I had to point
                            out that the Council was naturally apprehensive lest the Brazilian
                            authorities would confront it with a permanent offer calculated on a
                            greatly reduced capacity for payment corresponding to the coffee price
                            lower than at any time in the recent past.</p>
                        <p>I am frankly afraid that this question of permanent versus temporary
                            settlement is going to be a great source of difficulty. I rather gather
                            from the Ambassador’s incidental remarks that he was of the opinion that
                            the whole spirit in Brazil was against the payment of foreign debt. I
                            received the distinct impression that the Ambassador had not been
                            consulted regarding the method of handling foreign debts, and felt that
                            the situation was being exploited in Brazil with the hope of getting rid
                            of the Brazilian foreign debt (or at least to reduce the service
                            tremendously), and that he further felt the Brazilian authorities did
                            not fear the consequences of action of this type. In that connection I
                            took occasion to emphasize to him the great number of American holders
                            of Brazilian securities and to remark that cessation of payment by
                            Brazil would be regarded as an injurious action by these
                            bondholders.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador did not manifest his usual spirit of assurance.</p>
                        <p>He incidentally gave as his opinion the prophecy that Brazil would not
                            pay anything, at any rate in the immediate future, on its European
                            debt.</p>
                        <p>I telephoned immediately thereafter to Mr. White and gave him the
                            substance of the preceding. He said he would telephone Mr. Clark
                            tomorrow morning and after talking with Mr. Clark would telephone us and
                            possibly also the Ambassador.</p>

                        <p>172. My 171, November 21, 6 p.m. In the face of the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs’ statement that no unilateral action would be taken, the
                            Government decided on Saturday evening to interrupt debt payments.
                            However, as the Department will observe, the Government no longer talks
                            (my telegram No. 155, November 12, 2 p.m., in regard President Vargas’
                            radio broadcast of November 10) of a prolonged moratorium. Boucas
                            informs me the Minister of Finance will initiate conversations with the
                            bondholders at an early date, possibly the end of this week. Furthermore
                            the Government has instructed the states <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359"
                                facs="0369"/>and municipalities, as well as the Bank of Brazil, to

                            bondholders.</p>
                        <p>Boucas informs me confidentially that Brazil’s capacity of payment of the
                            foreign debt since the abolishment of the 35% exchange quota means a
                            reduction in foreign currencies of approximately 30%.</p>

                        <p>98. Please keep the Department informed by telegraph regarding
                            developments in the dollar bond situation, including the work of the
                            conferences reported to have started on December 20 with representatives
                            of the states for the purpose of studying “debt coordination and ways
                            and means to meet payments.” Press despatches on latter suggest that
                            Brazil is contemplating certain radical changes in debt servicing
                            procedure.</p>
                        <p>The Department also desires that you continue to use your best efforts
                            towards impressing the Brazilian Government with the great importance of
                            initiating negotiations with representatives of the American bondholders
                            without delay, and you are requested to emphasize this in such
                            conversations as you may have with Aranha. Immediate and tangible
                            progress in the matter and the earliest possible real assurance of a
                            disposition to make some reasonable offer should be very helpful to
                            Brazil’s general reputation and credit standing in this country; delay
                            and uncertainty are correspondingly harmful.</p>

                            insurance companies doing business in Brazil, called at the Embassy
                            yesterday and stated that the situation in regard to the proposed
                            legislation had altered materially from that described in the Embassy’s
                            despatches Nos. 1160 of September 22, 1936, and 1168 of September 25,
                                1936.<note n="50" xml:id="d394fn50">Neither printed.</note> Mr.
                            Cunningham stated that the bill had been referred in turn to three
                            committees of the Chamber of Deputies, namely, the Committees on
                            Justice, Social Legislation and Finance. The first of these committees
                            made certain minor amendments in the bill as originally presented, the
                            main one of which would extend from six to nine months the period within
                            which foreign insurance companies must turn their business over to
                            Brazilian companies with at least two-thirds of their stock owned by
                            Brazilian nationals. In this connection, Brazilian insurance companies
                            already established, most of which are of predominantly foreign capital,
                            have five years <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0371"/>to adapt
                            themselves under the bill to the new régime whereby two-thirds of the
                            capital control is to be in the hands of Brazilian nationals. The
                            Committee on Justice reported the bill, as amended, favorably some time
                            ago, although there appears to have been some opposition in the
                            discussions of the Committee.</p>
                        <p>The bill then went to the Committee on Social Legislation, which likewise
                            shortly presented a favorable report, adopted by the Committee by
                            acclamation and without any additional changes. Thereafter the bill was
                            referred to the Committee on Finance. According to information which has
                            reached Mr. Cunningham, the member of the Finance Committee to whom the
                            bill was referred for study has already submitted a draft report to the
                            whole Committee and it is expected that action will be taken on this
                            shortly. While Mr. Cunningham is not informed as to the nature of the
                            draft report, the inference is that it is likewise favorable. He
                            expressed concern over the manner in which, in his words, the bill was
                            “obviously being pushed through without adequate consideration”.</p>
                        <p>Should the report of the Finance Committee to the Chamber be favorable,
                            the bill will go to the floor of the Chamber for action. While the
                            President of the Chamber of Deputies, and certain other leading
                            Deputies, have connections with Brazilian insurance companies (with
                            foreign capital) which are just as opposed to the proposed legislation
                            as are the foreign insurance companies operating in Brazil, Mr.
                            Cunningham and the other representatives of the foreign insurance
                            companies are not at all sanguine of success in securing the defeat of
                            the bill or amendment thereof to make it satisfactory to them. Mr.
                            Cunningham referred to the chances as being at the most “50–50”.</p>
                        <p>In view of recent developments, Mr. Cunningham stated that he felt that
                            the time had now come for definite diplomatic representations by the
                            Embassy on behalf of his American principals. He asked that the Embassy
                            or the Department of State make formal representations to the Brazilian
                            Government against the proposed legislation, as has already been done by
                            the British Embassy in Rio de Janeiro. He said that he would today
                            recommend by air mail to his principals that they immediately request
                            the Department to have such action taken. In this connection Mr.
                            Cunningham left with me a copy of an excerpt from a memorandum which the
                            British insurance companies established in Brazil apparently presented
                            to the British Foreign Office some months ago, as well as of a
                            supplementary memorandum commenting thereon, which they submitted to the
                            British Ambassador to Brazil and which he used in the last
                            representations made by him to the Brazilian Foreign Office in this
                            connection. <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0372"/>Copies of these two
                            documents, which give the principal arguments of the foreign insurance
                            companies against the proposed legislation clearly and succinctly, are
                                enclosed.<note n="51" xml:id="d394fn51">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. Cunningham made certain comments of interest in that they modify the
                            picture presented by him in his previous conversations with the Embassy,
                            as reported in the Embassy’s despatches Nos. 1160 and 1168. He affirmed
                            that while it was true that there were 19 British companies doing
                            business in Brazil as compared to only two American companies, both
                            represented by him, and that consequently, the British had the bulk of
                            the business, nevertheless, the more important of his companies was the
                            one which had the most important individual share of the Brazilian
                            business.</p>
                        <p>So far as the plan is concerned which Mr. Cunningham had evolved to
                            enable his principals to continue to do business through a dummy holding
                            company of Brazilian nationality, described at the bottom of page two
                            and top of page three of the Embassy’s despatch No. 1168, he stated that
                            lie had had this scheme thoroughly studied by his attorneys. They have
                            now given him their carefully considered opinion that the plan will be
                            illegal in view of the clear wording of the bill, which provides that
                            two-thirds of the shares of stock in a Brazilian insurance company shall
                            be held by Brazilians and not more than one-third in the hands of
                            foreigners, and that the latter capital interest must be in the hands of
                            individual foreigners, preventing the possibility of any being held by
                            foreign corporate organizations, directly or indirectly.</p>
                        <p>I asked Mr. Cunningham whether he thought that any legislation which
                            would satisfy the foreign insurance companies and adequately protect
                            their interests could be anticipated, under the most favorable
                            circumstances, in view of the clear provisions of Article 117 of the
                            Brazilian Constitution of July 16, 1934, which reads, in translation:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The advancement of social economy (<hi rend="italic">economia
                                        popular</hi>), the development of credit and the progressive
                                    nationalization of banks of deposit, shall be promoted by
                                    legislation. Similarly, it shall provide for the nationalization
                                    of insurance enterprises in all of their aspects; the foreign
                                    (insurance) corporations which now operate in the country should
                                    be transformed into Brazilian corporations.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">He replied that he thought this was possible, as he
                            interpreted the Constitution merely to require that insurance companies
                            be established in Brazil subject to Brazilian laws, just as most of the
                            other large foreign corporations operating here have local subsidiaries.
                            He expressed the belief that vested property and investment rights could
                            and should be protected in complete accord with the Constitution, <pb
                                n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0373"/>merely by providing for the
                            establishment of national insurance companies under local laws, properly
                            safeguarded, without any provision as to majority ownership thereof
                            being in Brazilian hands.</p>
                        <p>In a conversation with a member of the Embassy staff yesterday evening,
                            Dr. Mario de Pimentel Brandão, Brazilian Acting Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, stated that he had the day before discussed the matter of the
                            pending insurance legislation with President Getulio Vargas, pointing
                            out that the British Ambassador had made strenuous representations and
                            that something should be done. It appears that the Acting Foreign
                            Minister is sympathetic to the arguments of the foreign insurance
                            companies. Dr. Pimentel Brandão said that the President had replied that
                            he did not see what he could do in regard to the matter since
                            legislation of the nature proposed was clearly provided for in the
                            Constitution. It would consequently seem that, should the Brazilian
                            Congress pass the proposed legislation in its present form, as is to be
                            expected, the President will approve it, unless effective pressure can
                            be brought to bear, and foreign interests will be faced with a <hi
                                rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> as in the case of the recent
                            legislation in regard to freight rates from Brazil (see the Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 1283 of February 17, 1937,<note n="52" xml:id="d394fn52"
                                >Not printed.</note> and other correspondence.)</p>

                        <p>Should the Department decide to take any steps on the insurance
                            companies’ request, it would appear that they should be taken promptly
                            in view of the advanced nature of the preliminaries to final legislation
                            and executive action thereon.</p>

                            <p>The American Foreign Insurance Association, which is composed of
                                American insurance companies engaged in the insurance business in
                                foreign countries, has been perturbed by a bill introduced in the
                                Brazilian Congress which would nationalize insurance in that country
                                and establish a Reinsurance Institute.</p>
                            <p>There is inclosed copy of a letter dated March 30, 1937,<note n="53"
                                    xml:id="d395fn53">Not attached to file copy.</note> addressed to
                                the Association by its representative in Brazil together with a

                                indicating the present status of this proposed legislation.</p>
                            <p>Sometime ago the inclosed brief was prepared by the Brazilian
                                representative of the American Foreign Insurance Association. A copy
                                of it is inclosed.<note n="53" xml:id="d395fn54">Not attached to

                                Brazil were Rs. 25.164:354$000. On December 31, 1934, the latest
                                available figures obtainable, assets of these companies increased to
                                Rs. 109.086:119$000, of which Rs. 40.247:649$000 were invested in
                                bonds of the external debt.</p>
                            <p>These data indicate that the increase in assets in the country
                                increased by some Rs. 84.000:000$000 during the 12 year period. The
                                increase in holding of external bonds amounted to Rs. 26.000:000$000
                                leaving a balance of Rs. 58.000:000$000 in additional assets as
                                against a profit of approximately Rs. 44.000:000$000. The American
                                Foreign Insurance Association contends, therefore, that there was no
                                export of premiums on profits which was not more than compensated by
                                the entry of new capital. The operations of the foreign insurance
                                companies did not result in the withdrawal of funds from Brazil but
                                on the contrary brought approximately Rs. 14.000:000$000 into the
                                country.</p>
                            <p>The principal reason advanced for the proposed legislation is that it
                                would end the “export of gold” from the country as indicated in the
                                statement that there is need “to regulate the insurance business
                                between this and foreign countries by maintaining a system of mutual
                                advantage and reducing to a minimum the remittance of exchange.”</p>
                            <p>The data furnished by the Association definitely establishes that the
                                argument that the proposed legislation is needed to prevent
                                withdrawals from Brazil is without merit since over the 12 year
                                period the <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0375"/>net effect has
                                been to increase the assets of the foreign companies within the
                                country.</p>
                            <p>It is a fair question to raise in view of this, whether the present
                                legislative proposal is not confiscatory in purpose rather than
                                designed to bring about the progressive nationalization of insurance
                                companies as contemplated by the framers of the new Brazilian
                                Constitution. It is also perhaps fair to state confiscation of
                                foreign interests in the insurance business under the guise of
                                nationalization may be only a prelude to similar action in other
                                industries.</p>
                            <p>Another interesting point made by the Association is that about
                                one-third of the present market value of shares of national
                                companies is held by foreigners; several national companies are
                                entirely owned by foreigners; and Brazilian capital would not be
                                able to absorb at fair prices the foreign held shares in such
                                national companies. In addition, additional capital would have to be
                                found to replace that of the foreign companies. It would therefore
                                be necessary to reduce the sale price of such foreign held shares
                                before Brazilian capital could take them over.</p>
                            <p>The American Foreign Insurance Association has learned that several
                                foreign governments, notably, Great Britain, France and Germany have
                                been making representations in behalf of their respective companies
                                and as no action has been taken by our government to protect our
                                insurance interests, has requested that our Ambassador to Brazil be
                                instructed to intervene.</p>

                        <p>42. Department’s 22, May 5, 11 a.m. I discussed the insurance legislation
                            with the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d397fn55">Mario de Pimentel Brandão.</note> yesterday <pb
                                n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0376"/>and left an <hi rend="italic"

                                Department files.</note> substantially as indicated in the
                            Department’s instruction. The Minister was fully conversant with the
                            question, having been approached on several occasions by the British,
                            French, German and Italian diplomatic representatives here. He informed
                            me that he fully recognizes the harm which the legislation if passed in
                            its present form would do to foreign insurance companies and said that
                            he had discussed the matter fully with the President. He assured me that
                            the insurance companies would have a full opportunity to present their
                            case before any action was taken and added with a significant gesture
                            that there is nothing for the companies to worry about at present. I
                            assume the attitude of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to mean that the
                            President has passed word along in proper quarters to the effect that no
                            action should be taken upon the proposed legislation at least during
                            this session of Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy, however, will continue to follow this matter closely.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            telegram No. 42 of May 8, 10 a.m., and to previous correspondence
                            regarding the project of law providing for the nationalization of
                            insurance companies and the establishment of a federal re-insurance
                            institution in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Although, as reported in the Embassy’s telegram under reference, the
                            project of law dealing with this subject has been temporarily shelved,
                            there is, of course, no assurance that it will not be actively pushed at
                            some future date. The bill is at present in the Finance Committee of the
                            Chamber of Deputies and the influence of the Minister of Finance<note
                                n="57" xml:id="d398fn57">Arthur de Souza Costa.</note> upon the
                            activities of that Committee is, of course, considerable. It occurs to
                            me that the presence of the Minister of Finance in Washington at this
                            time presents an opportune moment for the Department to mention this
                            matter to him, either directly or through Ambassador Aranha, in order to
                            elicit, if possible, assurances from the Minister that, when he returns
                            to Brazil, he will take active steps to kill this thoroughly obnoxious
                            piece of legislation. It is my impression that Ambassador Aranha himself
                            is firmly opposed to the passage of any legislation in Brazil which
                            might serve as a deterrent to the entry of foreign capital here, and
                            that if the question were put <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0377"
                            />up to him in this light it is quite possible that his influence, added
                            to that of the Department itself, might secure the support of the
                            Minister of Finance to our point of view.</p>

                            absent when you called the day prior to your departure from
                            Washington.</p>

                        <p>I had intended when I saw you again also to take up one further matter
                            which has caused some concern to American interests. I refer to the
                            proposed Brazilian insurance law which in its present form, according to
                            certain students of the matter, might tend to expel foreign capital
                            which Brazil may not be prepared to replace with its own capital, and to
                            discourage the ingress of new foreign capital by the spirit of
                            nationalism it appears to display. The insurance companies argue also
                            that it might result in an inconvenient withdrawal of capital across the
                            exchanges, and that the new setup, including the monopoly of
                            re-insurance, would result in a larger flow of premium funds out of the
                            country than the present régime. They also argue that the
                            “nationalization” of the insurance business might somewhat impair the
                            insurance protection enjoyed by Brazilians, or at least impair the
                            confidence of foreigners in such protection of property in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>In transmitting these comments I wish to make it clear that they are not
                            the observations of this Department, but of certain American economists
                            who have studied the proposed law and of American insurance interests
                            which might be affected by this legislation. Since I had planned to
                            mention them orally to you I take the liberty now of bringing them to
                            your attention for such consideration as they merit.</p>
                        <p>We are, of course, sure that no action with respect to insurance control
                            will be taken by your Government until all factors have been thoroughly
                            explored and we know that American interests will receive equitable
                            consideration.</p>

                            despatch No. 1422 of June 24, 1937, regarding the bill providing for the
                            nationalization of insurance companies and the establishment of a
                            Federal Reinsurance Institution in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Although, as reported in the above mentioned despatch, the bill has been
                            shelved for several months, it is again being actively discussed in the
                            Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and there is at least a
                            possibility of its passage during the present session of the Brazilian
                            Congress, which is scheduled to terminate on November 3rd. However, Mr.
                            William Cunningham, the representative of the two American insurance
                            companies which operate in Brazil, informed the Embassy today that he
                            has just had a long conversation with Senhor Valentim Bouças<note n="58"
                                xml:id="d400fn58">Member of the Brazilian Federal Foreign Trade

                            of Senhor Bouças that he would urge on the Minister of Finance the
                            desirability of the latter using his influence to delay this legislation
                            still further. Mr. Cunningham seemed confident that the Minister of
                            Finance would come to the assistance of the foreign insurance companies,
                            and for this reason he stated that he did not desire the Embassy to make
                            any representations for the time being.</p>

                        <p>131. My despatch No. 33 of September 14. My despatch No. 84 of Octobed
                                15<note n="59" xml:id="d401fn59">Not printed.</note> reported the
                            local representative of the American Foreign Insurance Association
                            optimistic as to the final outcome of the pending insurance legislation
                            due to presentation by a Deputy of a satisfactory substitute bill.
                            However, Cunningham now informs me the passage of the objectionable
                            legislation appears imminent due to the rejection of the substitute bill
                            and the approval of the original bill by the Finance Committee of the
                            Chamber of Deputies. This committee at the same time approved a motion
                            requesting information <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0379"/>from the
                            Minister of Finance as to the effect of this legislation upon the
                            finances and exchange position of Brazil but the wording of the motion
                            is such that the bill may be brought to the floor of the Chamber of
                            Deputies before the receipt of the information solicited.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Finance gave me to understand a few days ago he is opposed to
                            the bill but I understand it is being pushed by the Minister of

                            uncertain whether the Minister of Finance will be able to effect a

                            companies and the establishment of a Federal Reinsurance Institution in

                            Affairs. He told me that he is opposed to the bill, which is now before
                            the Chamber of Deputies, and that he is endeavoring to persuade
                            President Vargas to oppose it also. He added, however, that the Minister
                            of Labor is vehemently insisting that the bill be passed.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs remarked that, without doubt, new
                            insurance legislation is much needed here, but he feels that the
                            necessary aims can be accomplished without going to the extremes reached
                            in the pending bill of the Minister of Labor.</p>

                            No. 102 of October 20, 1937, and to previous correspondence regarding
                            the bill providing <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0380"/>for the
                            nationalization of insurance companies and the establishment of the
                            Federal Reinsurance Institute of Brazil.</p>
                        <p>The bill in question was brought upon the floor of the Chamber of
                            Deputies on October 23rd for second reading. Upon this occasion there
                            were presented numerous amendments to the bill, apparently inspired by
                            the lobby of the foreign insurance companies here. The result was that
                            the bill was referred back to the Committee of Justice, and must again
                            be considered, not only by this committee but by the Committees of
                            Social Legislation and Finance as well, before it is brought to the
                            floor of the Chamber for the third reading. The insurance companies,
                            while by no means optimistic that they can prevent the eventual passage
                            of the bill, are at least hopeful that through tactics such as those
                            reported above they will be able to delay its passage for some time.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 203 of December 17,<note n="64" xml:id="d404fn64">Not
                                printed.</note> enclosing copy and translation of a memorandum
                            prepared by the Legal Adviser of the Ministry of Labor, which expresses
                            the opinion that Article 145 of the new Constitution is fully operative
                            at the present time and that foreign insurance companies at present
                            operating in Brazil should immediately go into liquidation.</p>
                        <p>I am now informed by Mr. Cunningham, the local representative of the
                            American insurance companies operating here, that a representative
                            acting on behalf of all the foreign insurance companies, called upon the
                            Minister of Labor on December 20th and inquired regarding the
                            significance of the memorandum under reference. The Minister of Labor
                            replied that he deplored the publication of this opinion, which neither
                            has the force of law nor reflects the views of the Minister himself. The
                            Minister explained that the memorandum merely reflected the personal
                            opinion of the writer and was not an expression of the views of the
                            Brazilian Government, and that for <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371"
                                facs="0381"/>the time being, at least, the latter was not
                            contemplating any action injurious to the foreign insurance

                            copy of a letter dated May 18, 1937,<note n="66" xml:id="d405fn66">Not
                                printed.</note> received by the Embassy from the local
                            representative of the du Pont interests, requesting that the Embassy
                            make representations with a view to having eliminated from pending
                            legislation provisions to restrict to native-born Brazilians the
                            ownership of shares of corporations established in Brazil to deal in
                            electro-chemical products, metallurgy and explosives.</p>
                        <p>The measures to which the enclosed letter objects are two suggested
                            amendments to bill No. 424 of 1936, which proposes to regulate the
                            establishment and functioning of corporate organizations (<hi
                                rend="italic">sociedades anonym as</hi>) in Brazil. The amendments
                            in question were introduced in the Chamber of Deputies on January 8,
                            1937, by Deputy Henrique Lage, after the bill as a whole had passed its
                            second reading. They were referred to the Chamber Committee on the
                            Constitution and Justice. It is understood that the Committee has not
                            yet reported upon them, but, once it does, final legislative action will
                            probably not be long delayed since the bill only requires a third
                            reading for passage by the Chamber.</p>
                        <p>Copies and translations of the two pertinent amendments are
                                enclosed.<note n="66" xml:id="d405fn67">Not printed.</note> It will
                            be noted that the first amendment provides that corporations intended
                            for the carrying out of operations of interest to the national defense
                            of Brazil, “such as navigation, naval construction, siderurgy,
                            electro-chemistry, mining, (the manufacture <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372"
                                facs="0382"/>of) war material and explosives, can only be formed by
                            shares made out in the name of the owners (which must be) the property
                            of native-born Brazilians.” This amendment by itself would apparently
                            not affect corporations already legally established in Brazil, although
                            it would interfere with the incorporation of the new company to take
                            over the du Pont business in Brazil, Industrias Chimicas Brasileiras
                            “Duperial”, S. A., if the amendment were enacted into law and the legal
                            steps for incorporation were not completed before that occurred.</p>
                        <p>The second amendment, however, which provides that “the peremptory
                            provisions of this law are applicable to all corporations in operation,”
                            if enacted would apparently prevent any foreign capital in the Brazilian
                            industries mentioned, whether the corporations involved were or were not
                            already legally constituted.</p>
                        <p>It will be further noted that the author of the amendments is a class
                            deputy who is a member of a leading Brazilian industrial family which
                            has extensive interests in coastwise navigation, ship construction and
                            mining. Mr. Lage’s personal interest in pushing these amendments is
                            obvious. The Embassy is not in a position to judge at the present time
                            as to the chances of passage of the amendments, although they do not
                            seem to be consistent with the President’s many pronouncements during
                            the past two years as to the desire of his administration to attract
                            foreign capital.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador informed me a few days ago that he had presented a
                            short <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> to the Brazilian Foreign
                            Office, commenting upon the pending legislation and expressing the
                            expectation that the interests of British companies already established
                            in Brazil would be adequately protected in any measure which might be
                            enacted into law.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate it if the Department could instruct me as to the
                            nature of representations, if any, which I should make in the premises.
                            In view of the advanced state of the bill, a telegraphic reply is
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it should be noted that the new corporate entity to
                            operate in Brazil and take over the du Pont interests in this country,
                            Industrias Chimicas Brasileiras “Duperial”, S. A., will be a joint
                            subsidiary of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company and the Imperial
                            Chemical Industries. The Embassy is not informed as to what share each
                            of the parent companies will have in the Brazilian corporation.</p>
                        <p>This is, of course, an example of the complex international corporate
                            structure which many American companies are developing abroad and is but
                            one of several cases in Brazil. It would consequently be of material
                            assistance to the Embassy if it could be advised whether any definite
                            policy has been formulated by the Department <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373"
                                facs="0383"/>as to the extent to which protection should be accorded
                            to American interests when so closely interwoven with other “foreign”
                            interests and operating through local subsidiaries organized under local
                            laws.</p>
                        <p>Although a number of British-owned or controlled companies would seem to
                            be affected by the two Lage amendments, the only American interests
                            which have approached the Embassy for assistance in the matter so far
                            are the du Pont interests and then only after the local representative’s
                            attention was called to the pending legislation by a member of the
                            Embassy staff as he was, from all indications, unaware of it. The
                            language of the amendments is sufficiently vague so that it is not clear
                            whether other American interests would be prejudiced although some, such
                            as the manganese subsidiary of the United States Steel Products
                            Corporation, holding mining properties, would probably fall under their
                            provisions.</p>
                        <p>The Itabira Iron Mines concession, the local promoter of which is Mr.
                            Percival Farquhar, an American citizen, and which has aroused much
                            antagonism in nationalistic Brazilian circles, including the Lage
                            interests, would likewise apparently be prevented, at least in part. Mr.
                            Farquhar now claims that sixty per cent of the capital involved in the
                            Itabira project is American although the parent organization is
                            understood to be incorporated in Great Britain. In the past, Mr.
                            Farquhar has several times attempted to secure the Embassy’s aid in
                            representations to the Brazilian authorities in behalf of his group but
                            has always been vague as to his financial backing and refused to divulge
                            its source.</p>

                            <p>There has come to the attention of the Government of the United
                                States of America the fact that a bill (No. 424 of 1936) which
                                proposes to regulate the establishment and functioning of corporate
                                organizations (<hi rend="italic">sociedades anonymas</hi>) in Brazil
                                is now under consideration by the Chamber of Deputies. It has
                                further been noted that among the amendments to the bill which have
                                been presented are one providing that shares of stock in
                                corporations intended for the carrying out of operations of interest
                                to the national defense of Brazil, such as navigation, naval
                                construction, siderurgy, electro-chemistry, mining and the
                                manufacture of war material and explosives, shall be held solely and
                                exclusively by native-born Brazilians, and another providing that
                                the peremptory provisions of the bill will be applicable to all
                                corporations now in operation.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States directs the Embassy to express
                                the hope that, in any resultant or similar legislation, the
                                interests of American citizens in existing corporations will receive
                                adequate protection.</p>

                            despatch No. 1405 of June 10, 1937, concerning an <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> which was left with the Foreign Office in regard
                            to pending legislation concerning ownership of Brazilian industries
                            vital to the national defense. Under date of July 5th, the Foreign
                            Office advised the Embassy in the form of a memorandum (copy and
                            translation enclosed)<note n="68" xml:id="d408fn68">Not printed.</note>
                            that the Ministry <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0385"/>of Foreign
                            Affairs will take whatever steps may be necessary to safeguard the
                            rights of American citizens in existing Brazilian companies.</p>
                        <p>On July 6th the Chief of the Political Division of the Foreign Office,
                            who drafted the enclosed memorandum, informed a member of the Embassy
                            staff that subsequent to the receipt of the Embassy’s <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> he had made several visits to the Chamber of
                            Deputies in order thoroughly to familiarize himself with the pending
                            legislation; that he had had conversations with many influential
                            deputies concerning this matter; that it was now his definite impression
                            that the legislation in question was considered entirely too drastic by
                            a large majority of the members of the Chamber of Deputies and that it
                            would unquestionably be killed. As regards the possibility of the
                            presentation of similar legislation in the future, the Chief of the
                            Political Division stated that, although this is entirely possible, he
                            felt that existing rights and interests would, at all times, be taken
                            into consideration and protected.</p>

                        <p>At the press conference this morning, a correspondent asked the Acting
                            Secretary, Mr. Welles, about the reported cooperation of the United
                            States with Brazil in the construction of the destroyers for the
                            Brazilian Navy. The Acting Secretary said that he had seen the newspaper
                            report, and it was a matter which had been widely discussed in the press
                            for several months, and that there was nothing new or confidential about
                            it. He said that so far as the technical side was concerned the
                            correspondent would have to inquire at the Navy Department. He added
                            that it was his personal understanding that about two years ago the
                            Brazilian Government constructed a navy yard at Rio de Janeiro and had
                            under consideration the building of, he thought, three destroyers. We
                            have had a naval mission there for <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377"
                                facs="0387"/>some time, and they naturally turned to it for advice.
                            At the Brazilian Government’s request we sent down a technical man from
                            the Navy Department to assist in the construction work, simply in a
                            supervisory and consultative capacity. Regarding the supplying of plans
                            for the destroyers, the Acting Secretary went on to say that that is a
                            point on which the Navy Department would have to advise the

                            confidential. Concerning the purchase of materials in the United States,
                            the Acting Secretary said that there had been no understanding or
                            definite commitment of any kind, but merely an expression of belief by
                            the Brazilian Government that they could more readily purchase in the
                            United States those materials unobtainable in Brazil. The Acting
                            Secretary said he wished to emphasize the fact that the same type of
                            technical assistance would be gladly supplied to any other American
                            Republic asking for it.</p>

                            officials of the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently have
                            mentioned the receipt of cables from the Chilean Ambassador in

                            Affairs as my information now indicates that the French Parliament will
                            not ratify the Franco-Chilean convention of January 16, 1936 in the near
                            future. In such case our existing agreement of September 28, 1931 should

                            January 22, 3 p.m., relative to an exchange of notes with the Chilean
                            Government for <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0390"/>the purpose of

                            provided for by our agreement with Chile of September 28, 1931, I had a
                            short interview with the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>I took advantage of this occasion to mention to Don Miguel Cruchaga that
                            from both Señor Benjamín Cohen<note n="7" xml:id="d415fn7">Director of
                                the Diplomatic Department of the Chilean Ministry for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> and Señor Alberto Serrano of the Foreign Office I
                            had received intimations that the Chilean Ambassador in Washington had
                            cabled his Government that instructions had been sent me by the
                            Department to propose an exchange of notes to provide for reciprocal
                            favored nation treatment. I said that Señor Cohen had stated moreover
                            that the text of the agreement in question was to be so worded that it
                            would remain in force until the ratification of a commercial treaty
                            between the United States and Chile. I remarked that I did not
                            understand the significance of these statements.</p>
                        <p>For the Minister’s information I informed him that I was empowered to
                            propose an exchange of notes for the purpose of extending the provisions
                            of our existing commercial agreement should this become necessary owing
                            to the ratification by the French Government of the Franco-Chilean
                            Commercial Convention of January 16, 1936. I added that my present
                            advices indicated that such ratification is most unlikely in the near
                            future and I asked the Minister’s opinion as to this.</p>
                        <p>Don Miguel Cruchaga said confidentially that he has been particularly
                            anxious for me to propose an exchange of notes as this would be of great
                            assistance to his Government in its <hi rend="italic">negotiations with
                                the British Government</hi>. He did not specify just what he meant
                            by this. As to the question of the ratification by the French
                            Government, the Minister said that the situation was somewhat obscure
                            and he expected further reports from Paris. He admitted that should the
                            French Government not ratify the treaty with Chile prior to February 8th
                            next (not February 6th as stated in my despatch No. 474 of January 20,
                                1937<note n="8" xml:id="d415fn8">Not printed.</note>), the
                            Convention could be continued in provisional effect, for a further
                            period, by an exchange of notes with the French Legation.</p>
                        <p>To my question as to whether in such circumstances our agreement of
                            September 28, 1931, would not continue in force, the Minister did not
                            reply directly but said he would study the matter and let me know.</p>
                        <p>I said that in my note of April 18, 1936, I had conveyed on behalf of my
                            Government the draft of a proposed <hi rend="italic">modus

                            by the Chilean Government. I <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0391"
                            />stated also that I have been much perturbed by the difficulties now
                            being encountered by American export trade to Chile at the hands of the
                            Board of Exchange Control of the Republic—restrictions which bid fair to
                            affect that trade most disastrously. At the same time, I said, I would
                            be glad to oblige the Chilean Government by making a proposal for an
                            exchange of notes for the continuance of the existing mutual commercial
                            agreement if such a course should prove necessary.</p>
                        <p>In the above connection I have to report that the First Secretary of the
                            British Embassy has indicated a keen desire to keep me informed as to
                            the progress of affairs between the French Legation and the Chilean
                            Foreign Office in this matter. Mr. Cavendish Bentinck told me that the
                            French Chargé d’Affaires had read to him the draft of a reciprocal note
                            to the Chilean Government which proposed the extension of the
                            provisional status of the Franco-Chilean Commercial Convention until it
                            may be ratified by the French Government.</p>
                        <p>It is probable that this draft has been prepared in order to provide for
                            the continuance in provisional effect of the treaty. I have not learned
                            of the exchange of such notes as yet. The British Secretary seems
                            convinced that France will not ratify the treaty at this time and
                            appears to have wished to impress me with this fact.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned the situation to the British Ambassador who reiterated what
                            he had previously told me—that the treaty negotiations with Chile have
                            been carried on in London. He said that the Chilean Government has been
                            most insistent upon a commercial treaty but that his Government has not
                            desired to enter into one at this time—preferring an agreement by
                            exchange of notes. He expressed his belief that the French Chamber will
                            not ratify the treaty with Chile in the near future and said he believed
                            the policy which his Government will follow will be to enter into no
                            further agreement for the time being.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government would seem to be most anxious to be in a position
                            to make public announcement of additional commercial treaties. It would
                            appear to me also that Great Britain possibly may be seeking some
                            special trade concessions from Chile in return for such a pact. But no
                            information is available here yet on this point.</p>

                            by the Chilean officials who displayed in the course of it a very marked
                            desire that I agree to an exchange of notes providing for the renewal of

                            law was doubtful, and that the United States would not lose its
                            most-favored-nation advantages in any event, they yet were most
                            insistent on the advisability of a new and prompt exchange of notes.</p>
                        <p>At the close of this conversation Señor Serrano handed to the Commercial
                            Attaché a draft note which had been prepared in advance by the Foreign
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>I beg to transmit herewith a copy and translation of this draft which I
                            have no doubt the Department will not deem acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Briefly its provisions are as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>

                                <item>Neighboring countries are excepted from its provision to a far
                                    greater extent than in other temporary agreements which Chile
                                    has recently signed.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>The definite commitment for the study of a permanent
                                    commercial agreement is included.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The manner in which this draft has been put forward, and its contents has
                            confirmed my previous expectation that any form of note which I might
                            have proposed under the Department’s authorization would have been met
                            with counter proposals of this nature.</p>
                        <p>The eagerness of the Chilean Foreign Office in this matter is somewhat
                            difficult for me to understand. However, it would seem that it may be
                            attributed to at least two causes: (1) a desire to bring Great Britain
                            to the point of agreeing to negotiate a new commercial treaty by
                            pointing to a similar understanding with the United States; and (2) as
                            an asset in the March senatorial elections. In this latter connection,
                            the public has been given to understand by the Government-inspired press
                            that negotiations for commercial treaties with the United States and
                            Great Britain already are under way.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it has been announced that Don Miguel Cruchaga will soon resign
                            his portfolio as Minister of Foreign Affairs and will become a candidate
                            for election to the Senate. It may be that it would be considered useful
                            in this eventuality to allude to such pending treaty negotiations among
                            the accomplishments of Señor Cru-chaga’s term of office as Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0393"/>
                        <p>In view of the fact that there has been no indication yet of any
                            relaxation of exchange restrictions as affecting export trade from the
                            United States to this country, I would be glad to receive an expression
                            of the Department’s views in the matter of a new exchange of notes,
                            should this prove essential. I particularly desire to be informed as to
                            the Department’s wishes regarding the possible reference to negotiations
                            for a commercial treaty with Chile in such an exchange of notes.</p>
                        <p>I judge that the Chilean Foreign Office attaches considerable importance
                            to the inclusion of such a reference.</p>

                            provisionally extend a commercial treaty, pending ratification, for not
                            longer than one year, and since such power has now expired, the notes
                            concluded a new commercial convention, effective February 8, 1937, the
                            text of which is identical to that of the agreement of January 16, 1936.
                            Considering the Convention as signed anew, the President may now extend
                            its provisional effect, pending ratification, for one more year. Copies

                            despatch.</p>
                        <p>Since the Franco-Chilean Commercial Convention of January 16, 1936 and
                            February 8, 1937 remains only provisionally in view, ratifications not
                            having been exchanged, it would appear that the French <hi rend="italic"

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is noted that the draft provisional agreement submitted by the Chilean
                            Government restricts most-favored-nation treatment to tariffs alone.
                            This draft is sufficient to assure equality of treatment for Chilean
                            exports to the United States because this Government does not impose
                            exchange restrictions. On the other hand, this draft does not insure
                            corresponding equality of treatment for American exports to Chile
                            because Chile does impose exchange restrictions which, moreover, are
                            being applied at the present time with severe discrimination on certain
                            categories of American goods. An undertaking by the Government of Chile
                            to impose no restrictions or delays on payments for future imports from
                            the United States would extend the equality of treatment to American
                            exports, which this Government extends and desires to continue to extend
                            to Chilean exports. It should be noted that this Government in
                            suggesting such an undertaking is not seeking exclusive exchange
                            advantages. It is assumed that in pursuance of this undertaking the
                            Chilean Government would remove restrictions on exchange for imports
                            from other countries which do not impose exchange restrictions against
                            Chile. It would not affect the authority of the Exchange Control to
                            restrict non-commercial remittances to such countries. Such a free
                            system was apparently contemplated by the Chilean Government in the
                            memorandum exchange proposal submitted by the Minister of Hacienda under
                            date of March 27, 1934.<note n="15" xml:id="d418fn15">Not

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm the receipt of
                            the Department’s cabled Instruction No. 6 of February 18, 6 p.m., and to
                            transmit with this a copy of a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
                            dated the 22nd ultimo, and which encloses the text of a new <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> between the United States and Chile
                            as proposed by the Department.</p>
                        <p>I had hoped that before this I might have been in receipt of some
                            definite statement from the Foreign Office as regards its acceptance of
                            the proposed text.</p>
                        <p>However, the Department will understand that owing to the retirement of
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the subsequent distractions involved
                            by the parliamentary elections of the 7th instant and resulting
                            uncertainties as to changes in the Cabinet, there has been no real
                            opportunity to discuss the matter with an authoritative official.
                            Therefore, I have judged it best to adopt a waiting attitude.</p>
                        <p>I judge from comments made to me by minor officials of the Foreign Office
                            that the Department’s proposal was received with a certain sense of
                            relief by the Chilean Government. I am not certain, however, that this
                            was not due most largely to certain reference in the text to the
                            prospect of an eventual treaty of commerce and navigation.</p>
                        <p>It has been reported to me that the Chilean Embassy in London has given
                            the British Government to understand that negotiations are pending with
                            the United States for such an instrument.</p>
                        <p>Although this information is not authoritative, I do know that Chile has
                            pressed the advocacy of such a treaty with Great Britain for many months
                            past and it is not unlikely that the Government would find it
                            advantageous in that quarter to be able to point to the fact that
                            similar negotiations with the United States were under way.</p>
                        <p>I am also under the impression that the Department would not object to
                            affording Chile such indirect assistance should the latter accept a form
                            of <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> which would meet with its
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>Minor officials of the Foreign Office here have commented to me upon the
                            Department’s draft in rather favorable terms. The desire has been
                            expressed in these comments that we agree to certain changes in the text
                            which would strengthen the outlook for a definite treaty of commerce and
                            navigation to follow, etc.</p>
                        <p>At the present moment the resignation of the Minister of Hacienda and
                            Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs<note n="16" xml:id="d419fn16">Gustavo

                        <p>The Department will be promptly informed of any developments which may
                            transpire in connection with its proposed form of <hi rend="italic"

                                    Government of the United States will be pleased to explore with
                                    the Chilean officials upon their arrival in Washington the
                                    possibilities of a reciprocal trade agreement with Chile, which
                                    it is assumed would be of the kind which the United States has
                                    already negotiated with 15 countries and which it is now
                                    negotiating with other countries. These agreements comprise
                                    general provisions based upon the unconditional
                                    most-favored-nation principle, and schedules of tariff
                                    reductions and bindings. In this connection the Government of
                                    the United States would be glad to be informed, if possible
                                    before the beginning of such conversations, what in a general
                                    way the Chilean Government would expect the United States to
                                    grant Chile in a trade agreement; what in a general way the
                                    Chilean Government contemplates offering the United States in
                                    regard to tariff concessions; and particularly what kind of

                            opposed to bilateral agreements seeking to balance trade and payments as
                            between two countries and that it would, therefore, not be disposed to

                            of July 4, 6 p.m.,<note n="22" xml:id="d423fn22">Not printed.</note> I
                            have the honor to transmit herewith a copy and translation of the
                            memorandum from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, dated the 3d instant,
                            therein cited.</p>
                        <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0401"/>
                        <p>I assume that this memorandum has been prepared largely as a result of my
                            inquiries as to whether a response to the Department’s suggestions of
                            June 7th would be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>The absence from the text of the memorandum of specific comment upon the
                            points raised by the Department, I attribute more to unpreparedness here
                            and to the desire to await the primary outcome of Señor Desiderio
                            García’s conversations than to diplomatic subterfuge of any kind.</p>
                        <p>In my experience, the Chilean Foreign Office has been considerably
                            handicapped in its economic and commercial policies by the authoritative
                            and independent activities of the Ministry of Hacienda under the
                            direction of Señor Ross. In the main I have been impressed by the
                            apparent desire on the part of the Foreign Office to foster Chilean
                            relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>As I have reported previously, the actual situation shows very great
                            improvement over that which existed a year ago and I am of the opinion
                            that the attitude of the Foreign Office has been a contributary feature
                            in this improvement.</p>
                        <p>Our main difficulties at this time result from Chile’s exchange control
                            and compensation treaties policy. Should it be possible to bring about
                            an adjustment of the former which would eliminate all discrimination
                            against imports from the United States, I think our position would be as
                            satisfactory as conditions here permit.</p>

                            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Commerce has received the
                                memorandum of the Embassy of the United States dated June 9 last,
                                referring to the visit to be made in Washington by some members of
                                the Chilean Commercial Mission, sent to Japan, the purpose of which
                                is to cooperate with the Chilean Embassy in the negotiation of a
                                Commercial Convention with the United States, and adding that it
                                (the Embassy) has received instructions from its Government to state
                                that it will be pleased to study the possibilities of a reciprocal
                                agreement which it is presumed will be of the nature of those now
                                negotiated by the United States with 15 countries and which include
                                general provisions based on the “most-favored-nation” clause and
                                list of tariff reductions and commitments. It adds that the
                                Government of the United States would be pleased to be informed of
                                that which the Government of Chile expects on the part of the United
                                States, and particularly what program the Government of Chile
                                contemplates with <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0402"/>regard to
                                the equality of application of the measures of control of commerce
                                and exchange to American commerce. The memorandum concludes by
                                adding that the Government of the United States presumes that any
                                agreement would be in harmony with the pertinent resolutions of the
                                International Conference for the Maintenance of Peace of Buenos
                                Aires and Resolution No. 5 of the Seventh International Congress of
                                the American States at Montevideo.</p>
                            <p>In reply this Ministry is pleased to state that it has instructed Sr.
                                Desiderio García, Sub-Secretary of Commerce, to stop in Washington
                                and initiate conversations with representatives of the Government of
                                the United States which will tend to establish the general lines on
                                which a Commercial Convention which will definitely regulate
                                reciprocal interchange can be arranged. It is the intention of the
                                Government of Chile, precisely, to consider in the studies to be
                                made the ideas referred to in the Memorandum of the Embassy of the
                                United States, that is, the “most-favored-nation” clause and list of
                                concessions annexed and also, without doubt, the conditions for the
                                control of commerce and exchange. Further, the Government of Chile
                                finds inspiration for its policy in this regard in the resolutions
                                of the International Congresses to which the Embassy has made
                                reference.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Chile hopes that from the conferences and meetings
                                held with its Ambassador in Washington, on the occasion of the visit
                                of the Sub-Secretary of Commerce, and with that official, there can
                                be reached an agreement on general lines which satisfies the mutual
                                desire of both Governments to strengthen and facilitate reciprocal
                                interchange—an agreement which, having its basic points fixed as far
                                as possible in Washington, would be concluded upon the return of the
                                Sub-Secretary of Commerce by subsequent negotiations to determine
                                its specific terms and the form in which it would be drafted.</p>

                                Laurence Duggan, Chief of the Division of the American Republics,
                                and various divisional assistants.</note> in a frank and informal
                            manner the commercial relations between the United States and Chile. It
                            is believed <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0403"/>that these
                            discussions have served to clarify the points of view of the Governments
                            of Chile and the United States with respect to their commercial
                            relations. It has been particularly gratifying to learn from the Under
                            Secretary of Commerce that Chile entertains precisely the same
                            objectives as those of the Government of the United States, namely the
                            improvement and expansion of commercial relations between the two
                            countries through a liberal trade policy which is based upon the
                            principle of equality of treatment and designed to effect an ever
                            increasing exchange of goods.</p>
                        <p>Although it is fully understood that the purpose of these discussions was
                            not to reach binding commitments, nevertheless, as a matter of record,
                            it is believed desirable to embody in a memorandum the scope of the
                            discussions. It is the endeavor of this memorandum to set forth the
                            principal points raised and views expressed during the discussions, but
                            if any have been omitted through oversight, the Department of State
                            would welcome a memorandum from the Under Secretary of Commerce
                            indicating such omissions and making any other observations.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State set forth to the Under Secretary of Commerce its
                            basic view concerning the improvement of international trade, namely,
                            that a full and permanent solution of the trade and payments
                            difficulties with which various countries are today confronted depends
                            upon the removal of those excessive restrictions upon imports which have
                            contributed with such magnitude to the economic depression. The
                            Government of the United States is equally convinced that increases in
                            imports through removal of excessive trade restrictions are certain
                            ultimately to result in an increase of exports and that the contrary
                            policy leads to a diminution of exports. This conclusion is believed to
                            be especially valid when existing restrictions even although not so
                            intended, result in some instances in preferential treatment for the
                            products of one country as compared with the same or similar products of
                            another country.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State informed the Under Secretary of Commerce that it
                            was fully and sympathetically aware of the magnitude of the economic
                            difficulties with which Chile had had to contend, and had been gratified
                            to perceive the progress which Chile had made in overcoming these
                            difficulties. The Under Secretary was reminded, however, that the
                            foreign exchange control measures adopted by Chile during the economic
                            crisis had imposed severe burdens on United States trade with
                                Chile.<note n="24" xml:id="d424fn24">See <ref

                            rendered particularly acute as a result of the preferential rates and
                            amounts of exchange available for imports from countries with which
                            Chile has compensation <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0404"
                            />arrangements. There has been an especially wide margin of preference
                            in the case of products such as automobiles, radios, etc., for which
                            when imported from the United States, importers are obliged to pay as
                            high as 35 pesos to the dollar, whereas the same or similar products
                            originating in certain other countries can be covered at very much more
                            favorable rates.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, the Government of the United States has continuously
                            accorded to the imports of Chilean products unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment and desires to continue that policy of
                            equal and friendly treatment of Chilean trade.</p>
                        <p>Following the observations of the Department of State, the Under
                            Secretary of Commerce stated that the Chilean Government was in basic
                            accord with the views of the United States as to the necessity of
                            removal of artificial trade barriers as an ultimate solution of present
                            trade difficulties, and that the Chilean Government intended to proceed
                            by progressive steps as rapidly as possible to the complete elimination
                            of exchange restrictions. The Under Secretary stated, however, that it
                            would not be practicable for Chile to proceed immediately to the
                            elimination of these restrictions and that there would be of necessity a
                            transitional period which he hoped would not be long, provided trade
                            conditions continued favorable, during which the Chilean Government
                            would progressively lighten the present controls.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the unfavorable exchange rates which importers of certain
                            goods from the United States were obliged to pay in relation to the
                            rates which importers of like goods from compensation-agreement
                            countries were allowed, the Under Secretary of Commerce maintained that
                            this was all a matter of availabilities. He stated that Chile does not
                            grant preferential rates or amounts of exchange for imports from
                            compensation-agreement countries. These rates and amounts are determined
                            by supply and demand in accordance with the provisions of these
                            agreements. He stated that, since in general there is available an
                            abundance of exchange for the compensation-agreement countries, rates
                            for imports from such countries are more favorable than for dollar
                            exchange because the balance of payments is so adverse to Chile that
                            dollar availabilities are insufficient despite the fact that there is
                            made available for exports of the United States surpluses of exchange
                            derived from economic relations with other countries and from Chilean
                            gold production. The Under Secretary said further that the exchange
                            restrictions in question bore on only a relatively small portion of
                            American trade and asserted that, taking all the economic relations
                            between the two countries into account, Chile considered that American
                            interests as a whole received better treatment than those of any other
                            country. He suggested that more dollar availabilities could be created
                            if the American-owned industries <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0405"
                            />in Chile could be induced to retain in that country for the time being
                            a greater proportion of the proceeds of their sales abroad.</p>
                        <p>In regard to this suggestion the Under Secretary was informed that the
                            Government of the United States had consistently taken the position that
                            it could not assume any responsibility in respect of the allocation of
                            exchange as between different American interests, and that for the same
                            reason it did not regard it as proper to attempt to influence in any way
                            the policies of American-owned industries in Chile in regard to exchange
                            matters. As to availabilities, the Department of State declared that
                            recent reports indicated that there were at the present time sufficient
                            dollar availabilities at rates more favorable than those now established
                            by the Exchange Control Commission for certain categories of articles,
                            and that previous shortages had apparently occurred because of the
                            restrictions on exchange resulting from compensation arrangements with
                            other countries and the fact that the exchange rate of the peso was not
                            placed at its natural point, i. e., a rate which would have resulted
                            from the free operation of supply and demand.</p>
                        <p>It was said to the Under Secretary of Commerce that the existing
                            inequality of treatment in exchange matters was a result in large
                            measure of the compensation arrangements which Chile had entered into
                            with other countries. In this regard the Under Secretary of Commerce
                            stated that Chile did not consider these arrangements as a sound basis
                            for trade but had been forced to accept them in order to maintain access
                            to important markets for Chilean products. The Under Secretary said that
                            Chile had striven tenaciously to obtain provisions in those compensation
                            agreements which would protect the copper and nitrate industries and
                            thereby especially benefit American interests by providing that a
                            considerable portion of Chilean exports of these commodities should be
                            paid for in free currency. He asserted that the Chilean Government
                            thereby defended American interests as much or more than its own.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary stated that if these countries had succeeded in
                            imposing, as they endeavored to, a régime of complete compensation on
                            sales of nitrate and copper, the foreign exchange situation would have
                            been very much worse, both for the United States and Chile. The Under
                            Secretary of Commerce was reminded, however, that while Chile was
                            acceding to the desires of certain countries importing Chilean nitrate
                            in entering into compensation agreements, the United States, which was
                            receiving considerably more Chilean nitrate than all of such countries
                            combined, was imposing no restrictions upon the free importation of this
                            product into the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State heard with much gratification the statement by
                            the Under Secretary of Commerce that the Chilean Government <pb n="396"
                                xml:id="pg_396" facs="0406"/>had the intention to discontinue
                            exchange control as rapidly as circumstances may permit. In accordance
                            with this expression of policy, the Department of State suggested to the
                            Under Secretary of Commerce various steps that might be taken at this
                            time to ameliorate the situation. Among such measures were the
                            following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>1. To permit the category of articles regarded as not
                                    indispensable to be imported into Chile from countries not
                                    having compensation agreements to be covered in a free market at
                                    rates of exchange to be determined by the operation of supply
                                    and demand, this free market to be supplied by (1) the
                                    production of gold in Chile, (2) all available exchange other
                                    than that created by Chilean exports, and (3) exchange derived
                                    from Chilean exports when not required to pay for imports of
                                    necessary articles. It may be observed in this regard that the
                                    Department of State does not see how this could serve to
                                    increase prices in Chile for indispensable imports from the
                                    United States and other countries (Peru, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico,
                                    et cetera) making their trade settlement in dollars, which was
                                    the principal objection advanced by the Honorable the Under
                                    Secretary of Commerce to the complete abolition at this time of
                                    exchange control.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary pointed out that this proposal (<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>) might lead to the increased sale of exchange by exporters
                            in the free market rather than to the exchange control authorities,
                            forcing them to adopt very strict control measures difficult of
                            enforcement when, on the contrary, the Chilean policy is progressively
                            to lighten all restrictions on exchange transactions; and <hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) might curtail temporarily the production of
                            gold which the Chilean Government desires to maintain at present levels
                            for the time being; the Chilean Government having adopted the present
                            system of gold purchases with the sole object of increasing the means of
                            payment for automobiles, radios, et cetera, from the United States. It
                            was pointed out to the Under Secretary that <hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            other countries have successfully maintained a system such as that
                            suggested and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the subsidization of the
                            marginal production of gold was in effect a special surtax on imports of
                            United States goods.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said that he would be pleased to present the views of
                            the Department of State to the attention of his Government. He then
                            stated that he had a plan which he would like to suggest for the
                            consideration of the Department of State and which might serve to
                            ameliorate the restrictions on United States trade during the
                            transitional period. His plan envisaged the gradual reduction of the

                            until the former approximated the latter. This effect would be
                            accomplished in three ways: <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) by reducing the
                            handling charges and the price paid for gold; <hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            by making available as and when conditions permit exchange not derived
                            from the proceeds of exports or from gold; and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                            by the application to so-called luxury products of <pb n="397"
                                xml:id="pg_397" facs="0407"/>any excess of exchange at the export
                            draft rate. The Under Secretary stated that the possibility of reducing
                            the sale price of gold exchange is, however, conditioned by the
                            necessity of amortizing losses sustained by the gold-buying authority
                            during a several-months period prior to October 1936 when gold exchange
                            for imports of automobiles and radios was provided at the rate of 26
                            pesos to the dollar.</p>
                        <p>The Department informed the Under Secretary that it would welcome any
                            plan which would promptly and systematically remove the discriminations
                            now suffered by United States interests and which would thus pave the
                            way to attainment of the objective of the complete elimination of
                            exchange and other abnormal restrictions on United States trade.</p>

                            informally a tentative outline of a commercial accord between the two
                            countries, including tariff concessions, to operate until such time as a

                        <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0408"/>
                        <p>The Under Secretary of Commerce was informed that his suggestion opened
                            up interesting possibilities and that it would be given the most careful
                            study; also that the Department of State was pleased to note that many
                            of the provisions of the suggested agreement contained the broad
                            principles upon which it was the policy of the Government of the United
                            States to base its reciprocal trade agreements with other countries. He
                            was informed, however, that the United States could grant tariff
                            concessions of the type desired solely through the instrumentality of a
                            trade agreement made pursuant to the forms of procedure established
                            under the Trade Agreements Act of June 12, 1934,<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d424fn25">48 Stat. 943.</note> as renewed March 1,

                            that the Chilean Government would take steps to grant equality of
                            treatment to American trade with respect to exchange matters, and would
                            indicate its acceptance of the unconditional most-favored-nation
                            principle as the basis for a reciprocal trade agreement, the Government
                            of the United States would be happy to explore with the Chilean
                            Government the possibility of entering into negotiations for such an
                            agreement.</p>

                            relative to the anticipated <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0410"
                            />ratification of the Franco-Chilean Commercial Treaty of January 16,
                            1936, and its effect upon our most-favored-nation rights in Chile.</p>
                        <p>In its instruction the Department requests me to discuss the question of
                            most-favored-nation treatment of American trade with the Foreign
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>I beg to report that I have at no time received the impression that the
                            Chilean Government would be disposed to create difficulties in the
                            matter of the continuance of our most-favored-nation treatment in the
                            event of the ratification of its new treaty with France which will
                            automatically bring about the cancellation of the existing <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> between the United States and
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>The urgency of the situation referred to by me lies in the necessity for
                            some definite understanding between our Governments that the
                            most-favored-nation treatment stipulated in the <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> will not lapse when the new treaty with France is
                            ratified.</p>
                        <p>Although sufficient statistical information is not available to determine
                            the exact amount of American goods imported into Chile under reduced
                            duties provided for in the French and other commercial treaties, the
                            Commercial Attaché to the Embassy informs me that he estimates at
                            approximately $330,000, United States currency, the amount that would be
                            affected by the withdrawal of most-favored-nation treatment from the
                            United States. This estimate has been based partly on trade estimates
                            although official import statistics have been employed wherever
                            applicable.</p>
                        <p>Iron and steel products are the two largest groups of imports which would
                            be affected. The Commercial Attaché also states that, in the first case,
                            Germany is a far more serious competitor than France and, in the second
                            case, Japan and Germany are both important competitors in addition to
                            France.</p>
                        <p>Treaties now in force between Chile and Germany and between Chile and
                            Japan give those countries most-favored treatment. It is of obvious
                            importance, therefore, that United States products receive equal tariff
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances, it would seem but necessary for the Department to
                            decide what procedure it prefers to follow in the attainment of this
                            end. I have assumed heretofore that a fresh exchange of notes here to
                            provide for the continuation of most-favored-nation treatment under the
                            conditions which will supervene as a result of the ratification of the
                            new Franco-Chilean Treaty would be the means favored by the Department.
                            However, as I seemed to lack the necessary authorization, I have
                            scrupulously avoided all mention of the subject in my conversations with
                            Chilean officials. At the same time, it was reported to me several days
                            ago by the Commercial Attaché that, from his informal talks with Don
                            Desiderio García, he had inferred <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401"
                                facs="0411"/>that the Chilean Government would be glad to negotiate
                            a new <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> whenever I should intimate
                            such a desire on the part of the Department.</p>
                        <p>I have noted that the Department in its above-acknowledged instruction
                            authorized me only to discuss the question of the continuation of
                            most-favored-nation treatment with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and
                            that no allusion was made by it to the possibility of a new <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi.</hi></p>
                        <p>In the belief, therefore, that the Department may not favor the
                            authorization for an exchange of notes to this effect, I confined my
                            remarks to the Foreign Minister, in an interview on the 16th instant, to
                            a discussion of the situation as it will exist after the anticipated
                            ratification of the French Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I inquired whether the Chilean Government would be prepared to assent to
                            a continuation of most-favored-nation treatment by mutual accord only,
                            until the terms of a commercial treaty with the United States may be
                            agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gutiérrez<note n="29" xml:id="d428fn29">José Ramon Gutiérrez
                                Alliende, Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> said that, in
                            his personal opinion, this would seem to be feasible and the most simple
                            method of treating the situation. He added, however, that in order to
                            give me his official opinion in the matter he would be obliged to confer
                            with the specialists in his Ministry.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the question of a possible <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>, I beg to mention the fact that the British Government
                            evidently has proceeded on the assumption that the expiration of its <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, also based upon the Franco-Chilean
                                <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of May 22, 1931, will
                            precipitate an anomalous situation for British trade. As already
                            reported to the Department, the British Ambassador took energetic steps
                            with the Chilean Foreign Office to assure the postponement of the
                            pending ratification with France until the end of October next. During
                            this interim I understand the British Government will open negotiations
                            with Chile for a new commercial treaty.</p>
                        <p>Although the Foreign Minister has not yet informed me of the result of
                            his inquiries following upon our conversation of the 16th instant, I
                            feel reasonably confident he will suggest that a fresh exchange of notes
                            to extend the most-favored-nation treatment (as was necessary in May
                            1931) until the negotiation of a commercial treaty, will be desired by
                            his Government.</p>
                        <p>I have not yet ascertained that there is any provision in the Chilean
                            laws which would prevent that Government from granting
                            most-favored-nation treatment by mutual verbal accord. But the
                            Department is aware that during the long period from 1851 to 1931, when
                            such an arrangement existed, Chile was in a position to accord a general
                                <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0412"/>guaranty for such
                            treatment. This policy was definitely changed in 1931 with the advent of
                            the French and other commercial agreements.</p>
                        <p>The present intention of the Government seems to be to effect a gradual
                            reduction of the gold exchange rate, in order to fulfill its assurances
                            in the matter of the abandonment of its exchange control policy. It is
                            generally considered that this process will cover a period of
                            approximately one year. Therefore, if this intention is carried out,
                            there will continue to exist discrimination against American trade
                            during that period. In such case the negotiations for a treaty
                            satisfactory to the Department may be protracted, or delayed, and my
                            opinion is that it will be desirable, if not strictly essential, to
                            confirm the most-favored-nation treatment for our commerce in general by
                            a simple exchange of notes with the Chilean Government. It is my
                            understanding that the previous suggestions by the Department as regards
                            the text for a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> are deemed to have
                            been more or less superseded by the assurances received from Don
                            Desiderio García last summer.</p>
                        <p>There are at present taking place informal conversations by the
                            Commercial Attaché with Señor García for the purpose of studying a
                            suggestion by the latter of a means to hasten the abandonment of the
                            gold exchange control policy of his government. As soon as anything
                            tangible arises from these conversations I will at once inform the
                            Department.</p>

                            714 of September 17th last relative to the continuance of
                            most-favored-nation treatment of American trade in Chile after the
                            exchange of ratifications of the pending commercial agreement between
                            Chile and France.</p>
                        <p>Not having received any word from the Minister of Foreign Affairs as a
                            result of our conversation of September 16th, I mentioned the subject to
                            him again on the 28th ultimo.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gutiérrez stated that the intervention of the annual ceremonies
                            connected with the national celebrations following September 18th had
                            prevented him from devoting his attention to the subject of my
                            inquiries.</p>
                        <p>Today, the 1st instant, I sought another interview with the Foreign
                            Minister and he handed me a memorandum of which I beg to transmit <pb
                                n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0413"/>a copy and translation
                            herewith. I have learned confidentially that this memorandum has been
                            prepared for the Minister by Don Desiderio García, the Under Secretary
                            of Commerce.</p>
                        <p>The document of February 19, 1936,<note n="31" xml:id="d429fn31">Not
                                printed.</note> mentioned in the above memorandum, confirms the
                            extension of most-favored-nation treatment to American trade until the
                            formal ratification of the Franco-Chilean commercial treaty of January
                            16, 1936.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gutiérrez said that, after consulting with his staff, he finds an
                            exchange of notes to be the only practicable method of providing for the
                            continuance of most-favored-nation treatment of American trade in the
                            circumstances. He added some remarks as to the appreciation by his
                            Government of the patient and friendly attitude of the Department and of
                            myself throughout the situation by which Chile had been confronted
                            during the past two years, and expressed the desire to arrive at a
                            lasting solution of the existing difficulties prior to my departure from
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>I suggested to the Minister that some time may elapse before the final
                            text of a commercial treaty is agreed upon by our Governments and that
                            it might be preferable to refrain from employing the word “immediately”,
                            mentioned in his memorandum, in the text of a proposed exchange of
                            notes, and to state instead that most-favored-nation treatment will be
                            mutually extended until the signing of a commercial treaty between them.
                            At the same time, I suggested that the proposed notes might embody a
                            mutual assurance to the effect that no discrimination will be practiced
                            by either Government against the products of the other by the imposition
                            of arbitrary exchange rates, or other exchange control measures.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gutiérrez said he would take my suggestions under consideration and
                            that he would communicate with me shortly in regard to them.</p>
                        <p>I beg to report confidentially that the conversations of the Commercial
                            Attaché to the Embassy with Don Desiderio García to which I have alluded
                            previously seem to have reached a promising stage. The proposal by Señor
                            García for a prompt abandonment of the existing arbitrary control of
                            exchange rates was premised upon a means of continuing the purchases of
                            Lavadero gold by the Government from Chilean producers at the present
                            rate of 26.85 pesos to the dollar.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, this would be impossible when the flat rate of 25 pesos to the
                            dollar goes into force. Señor García states that the maintenance of the
                            Lavadero gold purchases is of very great necessity to the Government. In
                            addition to the surplus required for actual gold purchases, the
                            Government would require an additional sum of approximately 1.15 pesos
                            to the dollar for the operating expenses of its <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0414"/>Lavadero Gold Bureau—making a total of
                            approximately three pesos to the dollar above the proposed rate, for all
                            exchange, of 25 pesos to the dollar.</p>
                        <p>Señor García’s proposal consists of raising the import duties on
                            automobiles to the basic rate which existed until some three years ago,
                            or 33% per cent. It is estimated that such a step would increase the
                            revenues by approximately ten million pesos annually and that this sum
                            would enable the Lavadero Gold Bureau to continue its purchases of
                            domestic gold at the existing rate. Should this step be decided upon,
                            the Government could proceed at once to reduce the exchange rate of the
                            gold peso to twenty-five to the dollar, and thus eliminate the
                            objectionable control of exchange, without the long delay involved by
                            its present system of gradual reductions at intervals of several
                            months.</p>
                        <p>In effect, the raising of the automobile duties and the simultaneous
                            elimination of the arbitrary exchange control would have the effect of
                            greatly reducing the prices of American automobiles in this country and
                            should stimulate these imports at the expense of those produced by the
                            compensation treaty countries.</p>
                        <p>I may mention also, in this connection, that it has been reliably
                            reported to me that the Government will most probably raise the customs
                            duties on these and some other imports shortly, in any event.</p>
                        <p>The subject of Señor García’s proposal has been treated in strict
                            confidence by the Embassy at his request. I understand that he has
                            obtained the approval of the customs and other minor officials in its
                            regard and that he is today submitting the proposal to the consideration
                            of the Minister of Hacienda.</p>
                        <p>I beg to request an expression of the Department’s opinion regarding the
                            enclosed memorandum from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>I will at once communicate any new developments which may transpire in
                            the matter of Señor García’s proposal.</p>

                            <p>On May 22, 1931, there was signed in Santiago a Provisional
                                Commercial Convention with France which included a list of products
                                of that nation which would enjoy a preferential tariff rate.</p>
                            <p>As no agreement existed with the United States which would enable it
                                to benefit by these advantages, the Government of Chile, inspired by
                                the object of avoiding that the commerce of the United States be
                                placed under circumstances inferior to those of other nations,
                                arranged <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0415"/>with (the United
                                States) a Commercial <hi rend="italic">Modus Vivendi</hi> by an
                                exchange of Notes dated in Santiago on September 28 of the same
                                year.</p>
                            <p>In this <hi rend="italic">Modus Vivendi</hi>, which is in force at
                                this date, both Contracting Parties reciprocally granted each other
                                most-favored-nation treatment, and the Republic of Chile grants the
                                commerce of the United States, from the 22nd of May of that year,
                                the reduced duties applied to merchandise produced in France by
                                virtue of the Convention signed with that nation on that date.</p>
                            <p>The period for which the <hi rend="italic">Modus Vivendi</hi> would
                                be in force was established under its number 3) which states that it
                                shall be in effect as long as the above mentioned <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Modus Vivendi</hi> with France is in force, reserving the right
                                to denounce it voluntarily with 15 days notice.</p>
                            <p>Next, on January 16, 1936, the Government of Chile signed with the
                                Government of France a Commercial Treaty which states in its 12th
                                Article: “The provisions of the present Agreement replace those of
                                the <hi rend="italic">Modus Vivendi</hi> of May 22, 1931, which
                                shall be derogated from the date on which the present Convention
                                enters into effect.”</p>
                            <p>The Congresses of Chile and of France have already approved this
                                Convention and it is now ready for the exchange of the respective
                                ratification instruments, after which it shall definitely be in
                                force and the <hi rend="italic">Modus Vivendi</hi> with the United
                                States, in accordance with the stipulations, shall no longer be
                                effective.</p>
                            <p>When the Treaty with France was signed, a Memorandum dated February
                                19th was handed to the Embassy of the United States, pointing out
                                the situation which would be created for the commerce of that nation
                                once the existing instrument ceased to be effective and manifesting
                                the willingness of the Government of Chile to negotiate immediately
                                a Convention to replace it.</p>
                            <p>Undoubtedly unavoidable circumstances have kept the Government of the
                                United States from achieving this end before now. The Government of
                                Chile has desired to negotiate an Agreement of broader scope and of
                                a permanent nature, as is fitting in view of the importance of
                                reciprocal commercial traffic.</p>
                            <p>However, in view of the necessity of placing in effect the Treaty
                                with France and the short time which this would leave for
                                negotiations, it is believed that it would be most appropriate to
                                establish, by an exchange of Notes, the continuation of reciprocal
                                most-favored-nation treatment and the obligation of initiating
                                immediately the negotiations for the formulation of a definite
                                Commercial Agreement.</p>
                            <p>In this manner the commerce of the United States would not suffer the
                                disadvantage in its competition in the Chilean market which would
                                affect it once the existing <hi rend="italic">Modus Vivendi</hi> is
                                rendered ineffective by the enforcement of the new Treaty with
                                France. Lacking an instrument, even though it be of the provisional
                                nature suggested, the Government <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406"
                                    facs="0416"/>of Chile would have no means of giving the United
                                States most-favored-nation treatment, and the latter consequently
                                could not benefit by the preferential tariffs granted to third
                                nations.</p>

                            the Department feels that Chile should have no serious difficulty in
                            agreeing that future quotas shall be allocated on a proportionate share
                            basis. Hence the Embassy should use its best efforts to have numbered

                        <p>In view of the expected abolition of the discriminatory gold exchange

                            Chilean Government. If, however, these provisions appear to be
                            impossible of acceptance, you are authorized to negotiate with a view to
                            reaching, subject to the Department’s approval, the best agreement
                            possible in respect of exchange.</p>
                        <p>(4) In the course of your conversations, you may say that as soon as
                            American trade is accorded equality of treatment in Chile, this

                        <p>65. Department’s 40, October 28, 7 p.m. I had a conference this morning
                            with the Foreign Minister, García and Bohan.<note n="35"
                                xml:id="d431fn35">Merwin L. Bohan, Commercial Attaché.</note> It was
                            agreed that García, Bohan and Randall<note n="36" xml:id="d431fn36"
                                >Harold M. Randall, Assistant Commercial Attaché.</note> would
                            discuss the Department’s proposals this afternoon. In the meantime
                            García took up the question of the Department’s proposed text for
                            paragraph 3 of the above cable with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and
                            Hacienda. The result of the final conference is as follows:</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 3 of Department’s telegram—García remarked that the
                            uncertainties of the world situation and commitments under compensation
                            render it impossible for the Government to acquiesce in the Department’s
                            draft. He submitted as a result of his conference with the Ministers the
                            following substituted text which translates as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Within the limits fixed by existing exchange availabilities the
                                    Government of Chile will accord the most favorable treatment to
                                    the commerce <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0418"/>of the
                                    United States and will make every effort to avoid the imposition
                                    of exchange control measures demanding the use of exchange at
                                    rates exceeding those which would result from the free play of
                                    market supply and demand.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>García tentatively suggests the inclusion in the notes of a clause
                            providing for the establishment of a modern committee such as is now
                            established with Peru and Ecuador. In my opinion this might possibly
                            provide a safeguard against precipitate action by the control
                            commission, paragraph 4 of Department’s counter proposal of February 18,
                            1937. The Treaty Commission of the Foreign Office yesterday decided to
                            except the three frontier countries from future treaties embodying most
                            favored nation treatment. The Embassy is disinclined to accept this view
                            but would appreciate the Department’s reaction.</p>
                        <p>It would appear that all other paragraphs of the Department’s counter
                            proposal of February 18, 1937 will be acceptable, although there remains
                            a possibility that the Foreign Office may propose the inclusion of an
                            immediate consideration of a definitive treaty.</p>

                        <p>69. British Embassy states London Foreign Office recently learned that
                            ratifications Franco-Chilean Treaty will be exchanged Santiago November
                            19. London consequently decided to sign brief <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> with Chile omitting exchange clause with intention of
                            negotiating a full treaty during coming months. London now notified by
                            Chilean Government latter wishes also include in British <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> the exchange clause drafted by
                            García reported in Ambassador Philip’s telegram No. 65, October 29, 10
                            p.m. British idea still is to sign brief <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> without exchange clause unless a really strong clause
                            is offered by Chile. Ambassador Philip asks me to report to Department
                            his opinion that a clause containing a slightly stronger assurance than
                            García’s last offer might possibly be accepted by the Chilean
                            Government. My view Department might make early counter-proposal on
                            García clause, with the possibility that something worth accepting might
                            be worked out before November 19, but I should not shrink from signing
                            merely a brief last minute <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                            containing simply most-favored-nation clause on tariff rates and quotas,
                            unless Chilean exchange clause offers during next fortnight are
                            unexpectedly favorable. This would obviate feeling by <pb n="409"
                                xml:id="pg_409" facs="0419"/>Chile that the exchange situation had
                            been cleared up, and would leave an impression that something basic must
                            still be done. My impression exchange situation could well be dealt with
                            in conjunction with negotiations for full treaty, as Chileans have at
                            least a fairly strong desire for such a treaty to peg nitrate on free
                            list, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>Commercial Attaché and Ambassador favor accepting and including in <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> whatever best offer may be
                            obtainable prior to Franco-Chilean exchange of ratifications, in order
                            to give Chilean Foreign Office some hold on Exchange Control Commission.
                            They fear that full treaty negotiations may be indefinitely delayed or
                            come to nothing. I still favor omitting exchange clause from <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> unless the Chileans make a much
                            better offer; and believe there is a real chance for a broader
                            settlement in relatively near future. The British seem to have the same
                            ideas as I had reached.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the statement
                            made by Señor Pereira<note n="37" xml:id="d433fn37">C. Manuel Pereira,
                                First Secretary of the Chilean Embassy.</note> of the Chilean
                            Embassy, during a conference held in the Department on October 21st with
                            officials of the Division of American Republics, to the effect that the
                            Chilean Government took the view that foreign exchange provisions would
                            more properly be the subject of negotiation for a trade agreement than
                            for a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>. It is understood that the
                            Department has been disposed, on the other hand, to feel that an
                            exchange clause might well be included in a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>, if such an instrument is concluded prior to the entry
                            into permanent effect (at present set for November 19, 1937) of the
                            Franco-Chilean commercial treaty; since otherwise most-favored-nation
                            clauses respecting tariff rates and import quotas might be rendered
                            nugatory by Chilean exchange manipulations.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Foreign Office has now reached the opinion that the inclusion
                            of an exchange clause in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> would
                            be advantageous. The Commercial Attaché of the Embassy, who has handled
                            the negotiations, has stressed informally the argument that the
                            signature of an international agreement (a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>) pledging Chile to adopt a favorable course on exchange
                            would strengthen the hands of the Foreign Office in dealing with the
                            Exchange Control Commission. It has repeatedly been true that the
                            Chilean Foreign <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0420"/>Office has been
                            disposed to recognize the justice of American complaints with regard to
                            exchange, and yet has been unable to secure appropriate action here. The
                            Commercial Attaché feels that an exchange clause engaging Chile’s word
                            will to some extent create legal rights and responsibilities on the part
                            of the Foreign Office which will be helpful; and the Foreign Office
                            appears to be rather caught with this possibility.</p>
                        <p>It is possible, as Ambassador Philip stated in my telegram No. 69 of the
                            2nd instant, that the Foreign Office might even go so far as to approve
                            a more satisfactory clause than that furnished in the Ambassador’s
                            telegram No. 65 of October 29, 10 p.m. The Commercial Attaché has
                            drafted a clause which he feels might be secured, or serve as a basis
                            for Chilean concessions, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Government of Chile undertakes to accord, within the limits
                                    fixed by the actual amount of exchange available, the most

                                    and taxes and surcharges on exchange transactions, in connection
                                    with payments for or payments necessary and incidental to the

                                    or manufacture of any third country nor impose exchange control
                                    measures involving the use of exchange at rates higher than
                                    those which would be set by the free supply and demand of the
                                    market.”</p>

                            first part of the undertaking is indefinite, and the word “artificial”
                            in the second stipulation is objectionable, there is no question but
                            that a good deal of protection might be secured; and the Foreign Office
                            would certainly be gaining a weapon, perhaps as satisfactory as is
                            possible without new legislation, against the Exchange Control
                            Commission. If the Department should so decide and should issue a
                            telegraphic instruction to the Embassy, it might be feasible at the end
                            of next week to push through either the foregoing proposal or one
                            somewhat weaker. It would certainly be impossible to secure anything
                            stronger.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there are adverse considerations. With such a
                            provision once in existence, the Foreign Office might be less disposed
                                <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0421"/>than at present to feel a
                            sense of urgency in connection with negotiations for a general
                            commercial treaty. If the Foreign Office proved able to utilize the
                            clause successfully against the Exchange Control Commission, it might
                            also gradually become reluctant to modify a situation under which for
                            the first time it would enjoy a measure of actual authority in exchange
                            matters. The goal of our negotiations, I believe, should be a
                            modification of the entire exchange control system here; and there is a
                            strong probability that the objectionable Law No. 5107<note n="38"
                                xml:id="d433fn38">Chile, <hi rend="italic">Boletin de Leyes y

                                101, p. 659.</note> will in fact be thrown into the legislative
                            melting pot within the next few weeks or months. If our position remains
                            unprotected, and our causes for complaint quite unadjusted, we may be in
                            a better position to influence the trend of the new legal enactments to
                            be framed.</p>
                        <p>This will particularly be true if we are at that time in the course
                            actively of negotiating a general treaty, as we would then have definite
                            advantages to offer Chile, in return for exchange reforms. The
                            adjustment of the exchange situation may be thought of as logically
                            forming a part of a general settlement,—a view which the English have
                            held.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I may advert officially to the idea which I have been
                            advocating orally and informally for some months past that a definitive
                            and fundamental rearrangement of our economic relations with Chile
                            should in some way recognize the latter’s special disabilities in regard
                            to exchange. The Chilean point of view expressed in the Foreign Office
                            Memorandum transmitted with the Embassy’s despatch No. 261 of July 15,
                                1936,<note n="39" xml:id="d433fn39"><ref target="frus1936v05#pg_355"

                                        rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, p. 355</ref>.</note> and again in
                            Señor García’s informal memorandum of October 4, 1937, is based upon
                            convictions so deep and genuine that some cognizance of them will be
                            necessary if a broad and amicable economic understanding is to be
                            reached. Due to temporary circumstances in the Embassy this week it has
                            not been possible to prepare an adequate discussion of this point for
                            the present airmail; but the general factors are of course well known to
                            the Department. If the Department should find feasible some acceptance
                            of Chile’s belief that the uncompromising tactics of her Continental
                            customers force her, however reluctantly, to resort to protection for
                            her monetary unit in relation to ours, (in line with our policy of
                            sympathy and good will in Latin America), there is a fair likelihood
                            that a Hull treaty, involving a general reform of the exchange control
                            system here, might become practicable. On the contrary supposition, the
                            immediate negotiation of the best possible <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412"
                                facs="0422"/>exchange clause, and the probability that any <hi

                            remain the basis of our commercial relations for a protracted period,
                            should be definitely contemplated.</p>

                        <p>71. British Embassy states Chilean Foreign Office initiated suggestion
                            6th instant that present British <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                            without exchange clause be renewed for 6 months; and Embassy has
                            recommended this to London. Same source informed that postponement of
                            entry into effect Franco-Chilean treaty beyond November 19th is not
                            unlikely, especially if desired from any interested quarter. Whether
                            United States should include best possible exchange clause in our <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> seems to depend on whether

                            somewhat special attitude in Chile’s case. In any event current
                            indications of early and extensive diminution of international and
                            internal economic strength enjoyed by Chile during past year may counsel
                            rather active prosecution of our negotiations at this time.</p>

                        <p>48. Your 65 and 69 of October 29 and November 2, 1937.</p>
                        <p>(1) The Chilean substitute text for paragraph 3 is not acceptable for
                            inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> because it would
                            appear to constitute recognition by this Government of inequitable
                            treatment of American trade. You are therefore requested to continue
                            negotiations with a view to reaching the best agreement possible in
                            respect of exchange which does not embody a recognition of
                            discriminatory treatment.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government has repeatedly given assurances orally and in
                            writing that it intends to abolish exchange restrictions on trade with
                            the United States as soon as conditions permit. It would appear
                            incidentally that it would have a good effect on public opinion in the
                            United States, particularly among the financial and export <pb n="413"
                                xml:id="pg_413" facs="0423"/>communities, were the Chilean
                            Government to make in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> a clear
                            declaration of its intention to abolish exchange restrictions on trade
                            as soon as may be possible. If you believe that a better exchange
                            provision cannot be agreed upon, you are requested to seek as paragraph
                            3 of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> the following, which is
                            merely a repetition of previous assurances: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Government of Chile undertakes to abolish as soon as
                                    possible all forms of exchange control affecting the transfer of
                                    payment for articles the growth, produce or manufacture of the
                                    United States.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It should be clearly understood that the foregoing proposed provision
                            does not cover the question of the exchange treatment which this
                            Government expects from Chile pending the abolition of exchange
                            control.</p>
                        <p>(2) Considering that the provisions of the proposed <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi> are particularly limited in their scope, this
                            Government does not believe that it would be advisable to make provision
                            for a joint committee similar to the committees established by Chile and
                            Peru and Chile and Ecuador. This Government would be glad, however, to
                            give appropriate consideration to any definite proposals in this respect
                            which the Chilean Government might later wish to communicate.</p>
                        <p>(3) In regard to the recommendation of the Treaty Commission of the
                            Foreign Office that the treatment accorded three frontier countries be
                            excepted from most-favored-nation treatment granted other countries in
                            future agreements, this Government considers that to accept this
                            proposal would establish a precedent for new exceptions to the
                            most-favored-nation principle such as to undermine its entire liberal
                            trade policy including its trade agreements program. The existing <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> does not provide for such
                            exceptions. Señor Pereira, First Secretary of the Chilean Embassy, in a
                            conversation with officers of the Department on October 21 indicated
                            that his Government would be disposed to omit in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi> exceptions on the part of Chile. If, however,
                            the Foreign Office should be insistent in the matter, you may offer the
                            following counter proposal: Strike out the period after the word
                            “Agreement” in numbered paragraph 4, and insert in lieu thereof a
                            semicolon and the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“and this Agreement shall not apply in respect
                                    of advantages now accorded or which may hereafter be accorded by
                                    the United States of America or the Republic of Chile to
                                    adjacent countries in order to facilitate short frontier
                                    traffic.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Please communicate orally to the Foreign Minister the Department’s
                            position concerning the points mentioned above and keep the Department
                            informed of further developments by telegraph.</p>

                            morning that Department appreciates modifications of gold rates
                            applicable to imports of various American products; at the same time he
                            expressed the hope to the Ambassador that any prospective modifications
                            of tariff rates applicable to American products would not substantially
                            offset the benefits derived from the revision of exchange rates.</p>

                        <p>76. Department’s 48, November 9, noon. García as a result of three
                            protracted interviews has approved proposals with regard to <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> as outlined below. While these
                            proposals have also been discussed and approved by two other members of
                            the Comision de Tratados, they have still to be submitted to that body
                            as a whole in its formal session on the afternoon of the 19th instant.
                            The Embassy would appreciate the Department’s reactions in the meantime,
                            in order to facilitate prompt discussions, presumably final, on the
                            evening of the 19th or morning of the 20th. The date for exchange of
                            ratifications of the Franco-Chilean treaty can be retarded until
                            approximately the end of the month; but García is leaving for about a
                            week’s absence in Buenos Aires on the 21st.</p>
                        <p>1. The following text is suggested for paragraph 3 in the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi:</hi>
                            <list>
                                <item>“(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The Government of Chile will take
                                    the steps necessary to abolish, as soon as its international

                                    supply and demand of the market.” <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415"
                                        facs="0425"/>For the Department’s information the discussion
                                    hinged on the phrase “as soon as possible” and on the word
                                    “undertakes.” The Embassy feels that the Chilean proposal is as
                                    satisfactory as can be secured. Clause (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >b</hi>) is definite in its terms and affords a greater measure
                                    of protection than the Embassy had hoped to secure.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>2. García accepts paragraph 4 of the present <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> draft with the addition of the proposal as to short
                            frontier traffic furnished at the end of paragraph 3 of the Department’s
                            telegram No. 48 cited above, but only on condition: that the Department
                            agree to the pledge mentioned next below.</p>
                        <p>3. García proposes in addition to paragraph 7 of the present <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> draft an eighth paragraph as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Both Governments undertake immediately to initiate negotiations
                                    for the conclusion, within the shortest possible time, of a
                                    treaty of commerce and navigation to regulate in definitive form
                                    the economic relations between the two countries.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">García would alternatively accept a stipulation to the
                            effect that the new <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> terminate
                            within a set period of 6, 9 or 12 months, in order to render obligatory
                            the conclusion of a general treaty before that time. The British <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> as at present proposed provides for
                            its termination and the completion of a general British-Chilean treaty
                            by June 30, 1938. It may be explained that if a provision excluding
                            adjacent countries from the operation of the <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> could be inserted in paragraph 4, which García was
                            informed is impracticable, he would be willing to waive either of the
                            above alternative proposals.</p>
                        <p>4. Embassy believes that proposals for paragraphs 3 and 4 set forth above
                            should be accepted, as well as final stipulation for immediate treaty
                            negotiations.</p>

                            García particularly requested an assurance that the Department does not
                            contemplate any steps with regard to a customs duty on nitrate during
                            period between signing of <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> and
                            conclusion of general treaty. He apparently realized that such
                            assurances could not be in written form, but stated that a declaration
                            received orally would be <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0426"/>of
                            assistance in connection with <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>.
                            Embassy feels this to be an indication of Chilean nervousness regarding
                            nitrate and also of Chilean desire to negotiate general treaty, of which
                            latter desire I have had other recent indication. Department might
                            authorize informal oral statement as to its present intentions possibly
                            so couched as to leave impression that future intentions might be
                            different. This morning Vergara, Acting Foreign Minister, requested
                            following phrase to be inserted at beginning of paragraph 3; “the
                            Government of Chile confirms its previous declarations and reiterates
                            that it will take the steps, et cetera”. This seems admissible.</p>

                        <p>52. Your 76 and 77, November 17 and 18.</p>
                        <p>1. Item (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of suggested exchange provision is
                            satisfactory, including the amendment suggested in your 77. As regards
                            item (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) we are not fully clear as to its meaning
                            and intent. Does it mean that only one rate will be applied in respect
                            of payment for imports from the United States? Would this rate be the
                            same as the rate for corresponding imports from all other countries?
                            Does the exchange market referred to include exchange derived from all
                            sources including that blocked in compensation countries? How, if at
                            all, does the undertaking in (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) differ from a
                            commitment to permit a free exchange market? Upon receipt of an
                            interpretation as to the meaning of item (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), the
                            Department will promptly inform you whether it accepts the item as
                            proposed or in any amended form which you may submit.</p>
                        <p>2. García’s proposed paragraph with respect to entering into negotiations
                            for a treaty of commerce and navigation is satisfactory. However, it is
                            suggested that the language would be improved if it read as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Contracting Parties undertake immediately to initiate
                                    negotiations for a definitive treaty of friendship, commerce and
                                    navigation.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The new paragraph should be inserted between numbered paragraphs 5 and 6
                            of the Department’s counterproposal of February 18, 1937.<note n="40"

                        <p>In order that there may be no misunderstanding in the Foreign Office with
                            respect to what is meant by a definitive treaty of friendship, commerce
                            and navigation, you should explain clearly that such a <pb n="417"
                                xml:id="pg_417" facs="0427"/>treaty embraces the treatment of
                            nationals and shipping and other general relations as well as the broad
                            principles governing trade relations (but does not include tariff
                            schedules) and, in this country, requires the advice and consent of the
                            Senate to ratification. On the other hand, our trade agreements include
                            tariff schedules and deal only with commercial matters. Under existing
                            legislation, trade agreements are not submitted to the Senate for advice
                            and consent to ratification.</p>
                        <p>If the Foreign Office has reference to the negotiation of a reciprocal
                            trade agreement, you may say that we are prepared to explore the
                            possibilities of entering into negotiations after the <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi> is signed.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, you should explain that it would not be practicable to
                            agree to an undertaking in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> in
                            respect of trade agreement negotiations. The trade agreements act<note
                                n="41" xml:id="d439fn41">Approved June 12, 1934; 48 Stat.
                                943.</note> requires that formal public notice of intention to
                            negotiate be given in order that interested persons may have an
                            opportunity to present their views. Inasmuch as the steps necessary for
                            entering into trade agreement negotiations involve the setting up of

                                markets inevitable, namely export draft and free markets; and until
                                compensation trade eliminated arbitrage impossible except the
                                present noncompensation currencies. Therefore rate inequalities
                                between currencies will continue to feature local exchange market.
                                When dollar sterling export draft exchange plentiful only one rate
                                contemplated. Item (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) is designed to outlaw
                                another arbitrary gold rate situation but to allow use of exchange
                                other than that created by Chilean exports when export draft
                                exchange insufficient to cover demands for American products. Free
                                exchange can be obtained only at free rates while export draft
                                exchange has been kept within range of 24 to 26 pesos per
                                dollar.</item>

                                will probably be regarded as of primary importance by the Chileans

                                Foreign Office will issue a decree rendering agreement operative as

                                and that they cannot be held off more than a few days longer.</item>

                            with guidance respecting the various subjects to be included on the one

                            the United States, the officers of the Embassy have had in mind a trade
                            agreement along the general lines of the Brazilian-American agreement
                            signed on February 2, 1935,<note n="42" xml:id="d441fn42">Department of

                            respect to tariff rates and regulations, and also include clauses
                            respecting exchange treatment. It is noted, however, that the treaty of

                        <p>If the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> between Chile and the United
                            States is signed within the next few days, the Chilean Foreign Office
                            will probably be desirous of proceeding at once to explore the
                            possibilities of entering into negotiations for a reciprocal trade
                            agreement. The Embassy, as the Department is aware, also believes that
                            the conditions are more favorable for this purpose at the present time
                            than they are likely to be when the international metal prices shall
                            have reduced Chilean exchange availabilities, probably by the middle of
                            1938, and when the presidential campaign in Chile shall have rendered
                            the internal political situation here even less normal than at present.
                            If tentative conversations in respect to the trade agreement are opened,
                            accordingly, in order not to lose the impetus already gained and the
                            favorable atmosphere still prevailing, it will be advantageous to have a
                            definite idea as to what subjects may be incorporated in such an
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government has not previously shown any especial desire for a
                            treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation, and has accepted the
                            Department’s pledge in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> with
                            regard to such a treaty to some extent for the sake of appearances. On
                            the other hand, it possesses a genuine and rather earnest desire to
                            bring about the conclusion of a trade agreement at an early date. It is
                            therefore my impression that the negotiations with regard to the trade
                            agreement should be given precedence, and that the matters to be
                            included in it should be as numerous as possible. The trade agreement,
                            presumably, cannot be completed until understandings have been reached
                            with regard to the unconditional most-favored-nation principle, the
                            question of contiguous countries, and the exchange situation. Since
                            these subjects must be dealt with before the trade agreement can be
                            signed, it would seem well to negotiate with respect to them in the
                            agreement itself; after which they can be either repeated in a treaty of
                            friendship, commerce and navigation, or omitted from it. In any event
                            the negotiation of the treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation
                            will be a relatively simple matter once these subjects shall have been
                            disposed of, although there will naturally arise points of divergence
                            which may involve long delays and discussions.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy would therefore greatly appreciate an indication from the
                            Department as to whether the exploratory conversations, either at
                            Washington or at Santiago, with reference to the trade agreement should
                            deal with the three points above mentioned, and as to what other general
                            subjects such conversations are to include. As indicated, my view would
                            be that the trade agreement should be discussed upon as comprehensive a
                            basis as possible, with the expectation that the treaty of friendship,
                            commerce and navigation would then be dealt with on a relatively less
                            pressing basis.</p>

                            questions contained in the Department’s no. 52 of November 19, 6 p.m.,
                            as to the interpretation which the Chilean Government gives to proposed

                            days after the exchange of ratifications, our present <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>81. Department’s 54, November 24, 7 p.m. In García’s absence Embassy
                            fears any written Chilean interpretation of item 3 (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) would be as rigid and limited as possible. Indeed request
                            for written statement would in itself tend to impel even García to
                            restrict significance of clause or modify its terms. Present language
                            cannot mean less than it says as set forth in my 80, November 22, 7
                            p.m.; whereas if written statement is not sought there will be some
                            possibility of eliciting broader interpretation if circumstances
                            favorable. Therefore, venture liberty of suggesting in all sincerity
                            Department consider acceptance without collateral definition.</p>
                        <p>Department’s point regarding 15 days of grace is indubitably well taken,
                            but after exchange of ratifications an atmosphere of restraint and
                            pressure will arise.</p>

                            exchange clause. In Comisión de Tratados on the 26th Urrejola, President
                            of the Exchange Control Commission, insisted item 3 (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) our proposed <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> be
                            changed to terminate “higher than those which would be set for the
                            general export draft rates.” Foreign Office realizes that the American
                            Government could not sign an instrument recognizing export draft rates
                            which are not universal or equal as to all currencies, and will probably
                            be able to defend clause as offered last week. It telephoned to García
                            who is being delayed at Buenos Aires and he confirmed this policy.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile Foreign Office intimated to Embassy informally on the morning
                            of the 27th through Gazitva its concern and irritation over increases in
                            Grace Line freight rates on fruits and legumes. Without waiting to
                            verify facts as Embassy suggested it handed a statement to the press at
                            noon on the 27th beginning “In circles close to the Foreign Office” and
                            denounced the rate increases as unwarranted and destructive to Chilean
                            agricultural export sales to the United States. The statement intimated
                            in plain terms that Chile is likely to be forced to suspend commercial
                            negotiations and return to restrictive measures as result of diminished
                            exchange availabilities arising from lower exports due to the increased
                            freight rates. Embassy was disposed to regard this largely as an
                            emotional display but Foreign Minister’s interview with me this morning
                            (see my No. 84, November 30, 8 p.m.<note n="45" xml:id="d444fn45">Not
                                printed.</note>) indicates that he intends to force the issue on the
                            freight rates by every means within his power, although he did not
                            specifically allude to the trade negotiations.</p>

                                a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation.”</item>

                        <p>You will note that the foregoing text of article 8 omits the obligation

                            of friendship, commerce and navigation “within the shortest possible

                            relations between the two countries.” If, as seems likely, the Chilean
                            Government will desire to initiate exploratory conversations for a
                            reciprocal trade agreement upon the conclusion of the <hi rend="italic"

                            provisions of the trade agreement have been agreed upon. This does not
                            imply, however, that conversations could not be proceeding with respect
                            to other parts of the treaty.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Adverting to the current negotiations for
                            a Chilean-American <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, and
                            particularly to the exchange problem, I have the honor to report that
                            the delays in connection with the interpretation of Item 3 <hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi> of the draft may possibly prove to have had at
                            least the advantage of clearing the way for a more rapid definitive
                            exchange settlement in a subsequent trade agreement. The crux of the
                            exchange difficulty seems to have become the acceptance by Chile of <pb
                                n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0435"/>the principle that the exercise
                            of control, when needed, by import quotas based upon previous trade will
                            be practicable and will avoid overt differentiation in treatment between
                            the countries with which Chile has economic relations.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary of Commerce feels that the imposition of such quotas,
                            while it might safeguard the peso, would prevent Chile from recourse to
                            the compensation countries for needed articles which she could readily
                            pay for in the blocked currencies she holds. I have pointed out to him
                            that such situations would only be temporary, and the hardship for Chile
                            would be far less than that which would be caused to the United States
                            by Chile’s turning over American lines of trade to countries which have
                            been using shock tactics against Chile in the matter of exchange. I have
                            mentioned that neither the United States nor any other country can be
                            expected to sign a formal agreement conceding the right of Chile to
                            differentiate openly against its merchants. The probability which has
                            existed that exchange availabilities would be relatively abundant during
                            the next few months, and the possibility that a Chilean-American trade
                            agreement might in the meantime enable Chile to increase her dollar
                            availabilities by increasing to some extent her sale of products in the
                            United States, have also been pointed out. If this reasoning should be
                            successful in overcoming Señor García’s fear that the use of quotas
                            might exclude from Chile goods from Europe which she would be in a
                            position to pay for (and also might lead to sharp difficulties with
                            Europe), a long step would have been taken toward a Hull agreement.</p>
                        <p>In the contrary event, i. e. if the Foreign Office should refuse to make
                            the minor sacrifice of occasionally foregoing recourse to European
                            goods, for the sake of granting equality of treatment to the North
                            American partner who has sustained many losses through faith in Chile’s
                            economic future, there may be difficulty in concluding either the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> or a trade accord. In order to
                            expedite the reaching of decisions in the case of such a refusal on
                            Chile’s part, unlikely as this has seemed, it may be well to raise with
                            the Department at this time the question of the attitude and action
                            which might become advisable.</p>
                        <p>The Department will recall that in my telegram No. 69 of November 2, 1937
                            the view was expressed that if a really advantageous exchange clause
                            could not be secured in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> I would
                            not shrink from signing a brief last-minute agreement containing nothing
                            more than most-favored-nation clauses on tariff rates and import quotas.
                            This view was based, however, upon the assumption that the securing of a
                            suitable exchange clause would ultimately be possible through
                            negotiations and offers in connection with a Hull trade agreement. <pb
                                n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0436"/>It naturally will not hold good
                            if Chile’s recalcitrancy with regard to even a temporary exchange
                            settlement is found to be so rigid as to render a permanent settlement
                            through a trade agreement quite improbable. The prospects for a
                            provisional adjustment on exchange in the <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>, which have appeared rather good, have been based in
                            part on the absence of Don Gustavo Ross from Chile and in part upon the
                            apparent comprehension and good-will displayed by Don Desiderio García.
                            If it now eventuates that the latter, despite his protestations, is
                            firmly opposed to the sole mode of protecting the peso which could give
                            us equality of treatment, namely the use of import quotas, an active
                            doubt arises as to whether a brief <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                            without an exchange clause should be signed at all.</p>
                        <p>The signing of such a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> on the one
                            hand, would indicate our abandonment of hope for a satisfactory exchange
                            settlement, and therefore our abandonment of hope for the conclusion of
                            a Hull agreement. It would also foreshadow the indefinite continuation
                            of the frictions and recriminations which have marked Chile’s relations
                            with us for the past year, and which are by no means free of
                            unpleasantness for her. In this way it might even generate a revulsion
                            of Chilean official feeling which would turn out to be of aid in finally
                            securing exchange protection for us and a trade agreement for Chile.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand the signing of such a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> would at once give Chile exemption from the penalties
                            invocable under Section 338 the United States Customs Tariff,<note
                                n="47" xml:id="d449fn47">Tariff Act of 1930; 46 Stat. 590,
                                704.</note> and from the withholding of the American tariff
                            concessions made in the Hull agreements. Chile would grant us, it is
                            true, the special tariff rates contained in the Franco-Chilean
                            Commercial Treaty; but these affect only some $330, 000 of our shipments
                            to her. It might be more advantageous for the United States to suffer
                            the loss of these special rates, and retain the right to utilize the
                            sanctions provided by our legislators against tariff discrimination,
                            than to secure the rates and surrender our weapons for securing
                            permanent satisfaction in the far more important exchange matter. It
                            would be of relatively small benefit to us to protect this unimportant
                            amount of trade against tariff discrimination, if in order to do so we
                            should sacrifice the possibility of exchange safeguards which would
                            vitally affect our entire trade to Chile.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of these considerations it would be possible to contemplate
                            a policy of not signing any <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> if
                            García and his associates should prove obdurate as to Item 3 <hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi> of the present draft (a course on his part
                            which might indicate the impracticability of ever <pb n="427"
                                xml:id="pg_427" facs="0437"/>reaching an exchange settlement on
                            which a Hull agreement could be based). If Chile thereupon, after
                            exchanging the ratifications of her treaty with France, should proceed
                            to impose higher duties on certain American goods than those imposed on
                            the same goods from France and other favored nations, the United States
                            would retain the right to act under Section 338; or to add Chile to the
                            list, now composed solely of Germany and Australia, of the countries to
                            which the tariff concessions contained in our various Hull agreements
                            are not extended. While relatively few of the concessions as yet granted
                            by these agreements are of practical importance to Chile, it is likely
                            that some of those to be granted in our forthcoming trade agreements
                            with England and other countries would be so (or indeed might be made
                            with this purpose in mind). Moreover Chile would presumably not relish
                            the stigma of being denominated one of the three nations in the world
                            found culpable by the United States of the type of discrimination which
                            the Buenos Aires accords condemned. Our position, therefore, if we
                            decline to sign any <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, as a result of
                            Chilean obstinacy on the exchange clause, might in the long run bring
                            her to a fairer and more tractable spirit. This would be far from
                            certain, however, and a condition of tariff hostility might result in
                            which even a recourse to an American duty on nitrate (which would in
                            itself present many difficulties) would prove unavailing.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing possibilities have for several months been in my thoughts
                            and have not been mentioned to the Department because it has seemed
                            gratuitous to envisage developments so undesirable until circumstances
                            should compel this. Confidence has been felt that by the display of
                            sympathy and by the offer of the inducements which a Hull agreement
                            could contain, a full adjustment would become feasible. As stated at the
                            outset of this despatch, we may still entertain strong hopes for an
                            amicable arrangement. Nevertheless, Chile’s action in deliberately
                            withdrawing $4,000,000 of American exchange from the availabilities for
                            financing American trade, in order to spend it in buying European-made
                            naval cruisers, (reported in my telegram of today’s date, No. 98<note
                                n="48" xml:id="d449fn48">Not printed.</note>), coupled with the
                            apathy or antagonism shown by Señor García in connection with the import
                            quota aspect of the exchange clause in the <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>, may perhaps be regarded as modifying the prospects.
                            The possibility of refraining entirely from the signature of a <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> might therefore now be worthy of at
                            least cursory attention,—always with the hope that this attention will
                            prove to have been unnecessary.</p>

                        <p>100. Department’s telegram No. 55, December 2, 4 p.m. García today
                            accepts interpretation of item 3 b contained in my telegram No. 80<note

                                    >p. 417</ref>.</note> except fourth sentence which he wishes to
                            read as follows <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“If the value of the free dollar rises further than is deemed
                                    safe in Chile recourse can be had to limiting by the system of
                                    quotas, in accordance with the terms of article 2 of the <hi
                                        rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, the importation of
                                    specified articles whose payment may have been authorized with
                                    free exchange, or recourse can be had with the same purpose to
                                    other measures of general application.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I suggested that if the definition were thus to be amplified it should
                            also contain reference to increasing the draft rate as a means of
                            meeting an exchange scarcity and to the possibility of using quotas of
                            goods other than those which should previously have been made
                            financeable by free market dollars. García replied that both of these
                            possibilities are covered by “other measures of general applications,”
                            and stated that I might officially inform the Department that the
                            Foreign Office considers the phrase in question as covering <hi
                                rend="italic">inter alia</hi> export draft rate modifications and as
                            quotas on any types of articles. With this oral understanding, reached
                            definitely in the presence of the Commercial Attaché as well as Serrano
                            and Gacitua, I believe the García sentence might be accepted.</p>
                        <p>García suggests that the Embassy address an informal <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Commerce
                            furnishing the text of the interpretation given in my telegram number
                            80, revised as to the fourth sentence to conform to his suggestion, and
                            inquiring if the interpretation thus revised accords with the views of
                            the Chilean Government. If such an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                            is received he will reply in the following terms; <quote

                                    of commerce to contain provisions from which may be expected the
                                    assurance that there shall not recur the situations of scarcity
                                    of exchange for the needs of commerce which have caused the
                                    difficulties mentioned.”</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">This expression would open the way for a denunciation of
                            the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> by either party if the trade
                            agreement negotiations do not yield satisfactory results. I had
                            previously orally informed García clearly of the purport of the last
                            paragraph of the Department’s No. 55, and the above <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> which he is ready to send us is in a sense his
                            statement. The Embassy is convinced that the Chileans wish to negotiate
                            very seriously regarding a trade agreement when and if the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> is signed. The Embassy sees no
                            objection to their insistence on prompt definitive negotiations; and
                            feels that García’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> would have the
                            tactical advantage for us of leaving us in almost as free a position,
                            because the denunciation of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                            late next spring would be actively regarded by both parties as a
                            possibility, to adopt defensive measures through our tariff rates, if a
                            definitive exchange settlement cannot be reached in trade agreement
                            negotiations, as though no <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> were
                            signed. Yet if we wished to continue the <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> after failure of negotiations there would still be fair
                            prospects for doing this.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is disposed to feel that the Department would be in a better
                            rather than worse position to protest against Chilean rearmament project
                            if the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> were signed than if it were
                            dropped. García and the Foreign Office would be more disposed to combat
                            the objectionable features of the rearmament law to save a trade
                            agreement than to save the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>. He
                            claimed not to have studied the proposed bill, but stated that it
                            manifestly will greatly affect the exchange problem and will have his
                            immediate personal attention.</p>

                            “ammunitions” in Article 5 should be in the singular. It is noted that

                            reiterates” but the Department has no objection to this addition.</p>
                        <p>In as much as it now appears that the Chilean Government prefers to
                            proceed with the trade agreement conversations before negotiating the

                            however, that for greater clarity the words “treaty of commerce” in the

                            it is noted that you state in the latter telegram that the rearmament
                            bill will prolong exchange control for 10 years “thus rendering nugatory
                            item 3 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of proposed <hi rend="italic">modus

                            commitment regarding the abolition of exchange control to measures
                            affecting the transfer of payments for American merchandise. Since it
                            would appear that the Chilean Government could fulfill this obligation
                            and still enact the proposed legislation, no reason is perceived for

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Recently it has been brought to my
                            attention that in reply to an application by a Chilean importer for an
                            export draft exchange <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0441"/>permit to
                            cover the purchase of two commercial airplanes in the United States,
                            Señor Rafael Urrejola, President of the Exchange Control Commission,
                            replied by letter to the following effect: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Concerning the importation of two Beechcraft passenger
                                    airplanes, we wish to advise you that there is no inconvenience
                                    for us in authorizing it, covering the value of $17,000 (U.S.)
                                    with gold from Placer Mines (<hi rend="italic">Oro de
                                        Lavaderos</hi>) at a price to be determined by the chief of
                                    that service.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I have the honor to report that such permits are extended with
                            considerable frequency by the Exchange Control Commission. The procedure
                            in these cases is almost invariably the same. The importer of American
                            merchandise presents his permit at the “Oficina de Lavaderos de Oro” and
                            is there informed that exchange will be furnished at the rate of
                            thirty-five pesos to the dollar. Although the Embassy understands that
                            in a few special cases American interests have been granted gold
                            exchange at a more favorable rate than thirty-five pesos to the dollar,
                            these transactions are the exception, and the great majority of American
                            importations of the so-called luxury articles are admitted only at that
                            rate.</p>
                        <p>Thus the sources of exchange permits entirely ignore the assurances given
                            me by Don Gustavo Ross on December 11, 1936,<note n="54"
                                xml:id="d452fn54">See despatch No. 438, December 12, 1936, from the
                                Ambassador in Chile, <ref target="frus1936v05#pg_366"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1936, vol. <hi

                            henceforth the official rate of gold exchange would be twenty-six pesos
                            to the dollar. Señor Ross made this statement seemingly as a result of
                            my note of November 6, 1936,<note n="55" xml:id="d452fn55">For the text
                                of the note, see telegram No. 78, November 5, 1936, p.m., to the
                                Ambassador in Chile, <ref target="frus1936v05#pg_360"><hi
                                        rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 360</ref>.</note> to the effect
                            that our Government deemed the rate of thirty-five pesos as
                            discriminatory.</p>
                        <p>I may add that both the Exchange Control Commission and the “Oficina de
                            Lavaderos de Oro” have insisted that they have no authority to fix an
                            official rate of exchange. However, as stated, in certain favored cases,
                            such gold exchange has been furnished to American interests by the
                            latter at a lower rate than thirty-five pesos to the dollar. Legally the
                            Banco Central is the sole arbiter of official rates of exchange. But in
                            practice the bank is ignored by the Exchange Control Commission and the
                            “Oficina de Lavaderos”.</p>
                        <p>I was at one time informed that the “Oficina de Lavaderos” had the
                            practice of informing importers that no gold exchange existed at the
                            “official rate”, but that they could be obliged at the rate of
                            thirty-five pesos. However, of recent months the custom of the “Oficina”
                            has been merely to offer that rate only. Thus, the exchange situation
                            has remained much as it was when the fixing of the objectionable gold
                            rate was announced on October 30, 1936 (Cable No. 108 of October 30, 3
                                p.m.<note n="56" xml:id="d452fn56"><ref target="frus1936v05#pg_358"
                                        ><hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 358</ref>.</note>).
                            Furthermore, no official confirmation <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432"
                                facs="0442"/>of the new rate of twenty-six pesos has been received
                            by the Embassy, as Señor Ross gave me to understand would be done.</p>
                        <p>The above-mentioned reply of the President of the Exchange Control
                            Commission to a prospective importer embodied the additional inference
                            that commercial airplanes are now included in the extensive category of
                            American products denoted as luxury articles.</p>
                        <p>Such arbitrary treatment of our manufacturers seemed to me to call for
                            notice. The list is already so extensive as to cover most of the
                            principal exports to Chile from the United States—all of which, when
                            permitted entry, are necessarily covered by the artificial rate of
                            thirty-five pesos. At the same time it is a well known fact that the
                            supply of Chilean gold is much behind the necessary amount to cover the
                            bulk of current imports of such articles.</p>
                        <p>I have brought the unsatisfactory situation verbally to the attention of
                            the new Minister of Foreign Affairs on several occasions. He has
                            promised me his personal assistance in the matter, but I surmise that
                            the Foreign Office has focussed its attention upon the prospective
                            conversations in Washington, in July, on the arrival of its commercial
                            mission now in Japan, and that little action is to be expected in the
                            interim.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, I have judged it expedient to call the
                            Ministry’s attention to the situation by means of a note.</p>
                        <p>I beg to transmit to the Department a copy of this communication dated
                            the 17th instant.</p>
                        <p>With special regard to the activities of the Exchange Control Commission,
                            which has assumed the role of the Embassy’s “bête noir” during the past
                            year or more, I have to report that Señor Urrejola has put himself out
                            to express to me and to Dr. Randall, the Acting Commercial Attaché in
                            Mr. Bohan’s absence, his great desire to assist in the solution of our
                            difficulties. This is a new departure for Señor Urrejola and it may be
                            that it is due in some measure to the reported desire of the new
                            Minister of Hacienda, Señor Francisco Garcés Gana, to curtail the
                            activities of the Commission.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the Compañía de Electricidad, Mr. Curtis Calder, now here
                            on a visit, has informed me that his Company recently has been granted
                            all the exchange promised under the Ross-Calder Agreement.<note n="57"
                                xml:id="d452fn57">This agreement was signed on November 26, 1935, by

                                president of the American and Foreign Power Co.; it provided for a
                                reorganization of the Compañia Chilena de Electricidad, Ltd., and
                                the settlement of its exchange difficulties.</note> Señor Urrejola
                            states that he has liquidated a number of the frozen or blocked American
                            credits, to which subject I have attached particular importance in my
                            conversations, and that he will shortly propose a plan for the closing
                            up of all these credits. <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0443"/>The

                        <p>On the whole, I feel that our general trade outlook in Chile shows an
                            improvement and it is to be hoped that further cabinet changes, which
                            are now rumored as the probable outcome of the political situation here,
                            will not affect this adversely.</p>

                                of merchandise, which come chiefly from the United States, while
                                imports of the same commodities from countries having compensation
                                agreements with Chile are granted exchange rates more favorable than
                                that governing such imports from the United States, my Government
                                would have no course other than to regard that rate as
                                discriminatory against the commerce of the United States.</p>
                            <p>I have been recently informed that in reply to a request to import
                                commercial airplanes from the United States, the Exchange Control
                                Commission has replied that such authorization would be granted
                                subject to the availability of Placer Mines (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Lavaderos de Oro</hi>) gold exchange.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy views with concern this apparent tendency of the Exchange
                                Control Commission to augment the list of items now requiring
                                payment in gold. Further, much of the merchandise on the gold list
                                is of prime necessity to Chile and it is evident that there is an
                                insufficient supply of Placer Mines gold exchange to cover the
                                requirements of Chilean importers. It has been reported to me that
                                deliveries of gold exchange are as much as three to four months
                                behind current demand.</p>
                            <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0444"/>
                            <p>In view of this general situation, and of the recent expression of
                                the Exchange Control Commission, I beg to request information as to
                                whether aircraft and aviation materials have now been
                                definitely-classified by the Government of the Republic as luxury
                                articles and, as such, to be imported from the United States only
                                against foreign exchange arising from Chilean produced gold and at
                                the rate of 35 pesos per U. S. dollar.</p>
                            <p>Feeling assured of the desire of the Government of the Republic to
                                facilitate in every way its trade relations with the United States,
                                I beg to avail myself of this opportunity to suggest that the
                                existing unsatisfactory situation might be ameliorated by the
                                transfer of numerous articles now on the gold list to the category
                                of those imported from my country with export draft exchange, should
                                the Exchange Control Commission agree to this partial solution of
                                the problem.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: Your Excellency has seen
                                fit, in Note No. 469 of May 17th last, to refer to the situation of
                                that merchandise imported from the United States which the Exchange
                                Control Commission classifies as luxury articles, permitting their
                                entry into the country only against exchange arising from Placer
                                Mines gold.</p>
                            <p>After recalling the position expressed in the Note of November 6,
                                1936,—that as long as the special rate of 35 pesos per dollar is
                                maintained, Your Excellency’s Government has no course other than to
                                regard it as discriminatory against the commerce of the United
                                States,—Your Excellency states that you have recently been informed
                                that the Exchange Commission, having been consulted upon the
                                importation of commercial airplanes, replied that this permission
                                would be granted subject to said Placer Gold exchange. For this
                                reason Your Excellency manifests your concern due to this apparent
                                tendency to augment the list of articles which require payment in
                                gold, for which you believe the availabilities to be insufficient
                                as, according to information received by Your Excellency, deliveries
                                of gold exchange are delayed three or four months. Your Excellency
                                ends by requesting me to inform you in this regard and by suggesting
                                that the situation referred to might be ameliorated by transferring
                                several articles which are now on the gold list to (the list of)
                                those payable in export draft exchange.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that I have
                                given careful consideration to the problems which Your Excellency
                                has mentioned and which have been a cause of concern to this
                                Chancery for some time, so as to find a just and harmonious solution
                                which would make possible a definite arrangement, as I had the honor
                                to <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0446"/>state to Your Excellency
                                in the <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> of the 29th of April
                                last. While we continue our efforts to find the formula which would
                                satisfy these desires, I have at present the honor to inform Your
                                Excellency that the Exchange Control Commission, in answer to the
                                specific requests embodied in Your Excellency’s note now being
                                answered, has stated to this Ministry that it has not established
                                that importations of commercial airplanes from the United States
                                must be covered with Placer Mines gold, but to the contrary that it
                                is disposed to authorize these importations with export draft
                                exchange.</p>
                            <p>I also take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that the Exchange
                                Commission has adopted extraordinary measures to bring up to date,
                                within the first weeks of this month, all pending requests to be
                                covered with this exchange. That Your Excellency may be more fully

                                precisely the aims which govern it, and I shall be most happy if my
                                personal action in this Ministry contributes to the establishment of
                                the solutions which we seek and which, for mutual benefit, should

                            noted that the declaration engages the Government to abandon the system

                            been settled. In this connection I refer to my telegram No. 63 of
                            October 26, 3 p.m., 1937.<note n="60" xml:id="d455fn60">Not

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The Minister of Colombia
                            came to see me this morning with a confidential message from the
                            President of Colombia. President Lopez wants us to know that about ten
                            days or two weeks ago a Japanese mission visited Bogotá ostensibly for
                            the purpose of furthering trade between Japan and Colombia. The
                            President is informed, however, that during the course of the visit of
                            this Japanese mission the members thereof were in close touch with
                            certain German nationals in Colombia, particularly with those who reside
                            on the Colombian coast between Cartagena and the Panamanian boundary as
                            well as in Buenaventura on the Pacific coast. Dr. Lopez states that he
                            has these German nationals now under surveillance. The suggestion was
                            made that because of the Far Eastern situation, this Government might
                            care to discuss with the Colombian Government certain matters of common
                            interest to the two Governments, namely, the surveillance of portions of
                            the coast of Colombia adjacent to the Republic of Panama and certain
                            measures in which both Governments might cooperate regarding the
                            surveillance of waters adjacent to the Canal.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that I was highly appreciative of this suggestion and
                            that I would convey it to you. I inquired of the Minister the methods
                            which his Government would consider the most appropriate for the purpose
                            of carrying on such conversations should they be deemed desirable. I
                            further asked the Minister whether his Government would prefer having a
                            representative of the Navy Department take a trip to Bogotá or whether
                            it would prefer having some representative of his Government come to
                            Washington in order to take the matter up here. He told me that he would
                            consult confidentially with his brother, the President, and let me know
                            if they had any preference in the matter.</p>
                        <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0449"/>
                        <p>It would seem to me that a step of this kind could do no harm and might
                            in fact prove advantageous. Will you let me know what your wishes may be
                            so that I may inform the Minister accordingly. I, of course, took the
                            precaution of telling him that we must consider our conversations
                            strictly confidential, and he told me that no one except his brother,
                            the President, knew anything about the matter.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                        <p>As no doubt you will recall, this Government has on more than one
                            occasion indicated to the Dominican Government informally that it would
                            be glad to give the most favorable consideration to any concrete
                            proposal advanced to it by the Dominican Government looking towards a
                            revision of the 1924 Convention.</p>
                        <p>There is little need for me to remind you of the fact which I feel sure
                            every Dominican realizes, that the loans obtained by the Dominican
                            Government since 1907 have been rendered possible on comparatively easy
                            terms primarily because of the commitments undertaken by the United
                            States. Dominican Government bonds have been purchased by nationals of
                            the United States as well as by nationals of other countries because of
                            the terms of the Convention, and consequently, this Government owes
                            these bondholders a very definite responsibility, so that it cannot
                            agree to abrogate the treaty unless the legitimate rights of the
                            bondholders are fully respected.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States believes that it has with increasing
                            frequency in recent years amply demonstrated its regard and sympathy
                            towards legitimate Dominican aspirations. As an instance of this, I
                            might mention the considerate attitude of this Government concerning the
                            emergency plan adopted in 1933.<note n="4" xml:id="d458fn4">See <ref

                            thereby, from the <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0451"/>strict and

                            the bondholders are respected, this Government has no interest in
                            continuing the present provisions of the Convention of 1924, nor the
                            general receivership as a treaty entity. On the contrary, in accordance
                            with its determined policy of refraining from any form of activity
                            involving participation by it, even through treaty right, in the
                            domestic concerns of the other American republics, the Government of the
                            United States would welcome the opportunity, upon the basis above
                            stated, of relinquishing the obligations which it assumed under the
                            terms of the Convention of 1924.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, as respects the negotiation of a commercial understanding, I am
                            glad to assure you that this Government will be most happy to examine
                            the question anew in a spirit of friendly and frank understanding. I
                            should be lacking in candor, were I not to remind you in this regard,
                            that the American Government has been concerned at the apparent delay of
                            the Dominican Government in extending full most-favored-nation treatment

                        <p>The Minister of Santo Domingo, accompanied by the Dominican Minister to
                            London, Dr. Enrique [<hi rend="italic">Henríquez</hi>] Ureña, came in
                            and handed me the attached note from their government.<note n="9"

                            that I would examine it with interest and care and give it the fullest
                            consideration. I repeated what so many times Mr. Welles<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d459fn10">Sumner Welles, Assistant Secretary of
                                State.</note> and I have said to them that our Government is very
                            desirous of clearing up every undesirable condition existing between
                            this Government and every government in Latin America; that I earnestly
                            hoped that the Government of Santo Domingo would be able to meet us half
                            way in this righteous undertaking; and that this Government, if
                            possible, is even more anxious than the Government of Santo Domingo to
                            get this undertaking accomplished. I added that, of course, if we should
                            fail to carry out our trusteeship for American bondholders, which was
                            assumed by a predecessor of mine, the United States Senate would not
                            ratify the agreement, and it would go for naught. I elaborated somewhat
                            upon the foregoing lines of conversation. They exhibited a thoroughly
                            agreeable and sympathetic attitude.</p>

                            February 10, 1937, addressed to Minister Pastoriza, Your Excellency,
                            after stating that you are informed of the desire of the Dominican
                            Government to undertake a complete revision of the Dominican-American
                            Convention <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0453"/>of 1924, declares
                            that you are disposed to hear the concrete suggestions on the matter
                            that our Government may wish to formulate.</p>
                        <p>In response to those indications, we have the honor to send to Your
                            Excellency a draft of a protocol containing the ideas of the Dominican
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe it necessary to reiterate our Government’s opinion that
                            the 1924 Convention must be replaced by another instrument more in
                            harmony with the needs of the present time and with the present trend of
                            Pan-American international life. Applying an identical opinion, and
                            taking as a basis the broad and shining “good neighbor” policy, the
                            United States has already modified other treaties of past epochs, such

                        <p>In proposing the modification of the 1924 Convention (which has been in
                            existence for thirty years, strictly speaking, since it was a

                            propose any stipulation tending to diminish even in the slightest

                            the holders of bonds of the Dominican public debt. The mechanism
                            established for the payment of the debt differs, undoubtedly, in
                            external details, in order to render it compatible with the idea of
                            Dominican sovereignty, but the guarantees are exactly the same, and
                            provision is still made for reestablishing the procedure provided in the
                            Convention which it is intended to replace, at any period of justified
                            uneasiness, while the causes for such uneasiness last. We believe that
                            such a contingency is outside any probability, not only because
                            conditions in the country are very different from those which prevailed
                            thirty years ago, but also because one of the defects of the two
                            Conventions, the one of 1907 and the one of 1924, was that of
                            establishing terms and conditions for amortization that were beyond the
                            economic capacity of the Republic, and those terms and conditions have
                            been expressly modified by means of an agreement with the bondholders,
                            in such a way that the Dominican Republic will be able to accomplish the
                            service on the debt at all times without difficulties, until its final
                            payment. But although such a contingency may be improbable, we have
                            wished to provide for it expressly, in order to make it impossible for
                            any creditor to think that he does not count on the same guarantees of

                        <p>Other points, the modification of which we consider essential, are those
                            referring to the concept of excessive limitation of the sovereign power
                            of the Dominican Republic to change its tariffs and the concept, also
                            too restricted, of what may be considered an increase in its public
                            debt. It is necessary to formulate explanations of both points to avoid
                            difficulties in interpretation in the future.</p>
                        <p>Our intention of presenting the concrete bases of revision proposed by
                            the Dominican Government with regard to the Convention of 1924 being
                            fulfilled, it remains for us only to mention the second point of Your
                            Excellency’s note: that which refers to the conclusion of a commercial
                            treaty between the United States of America and the Dominican Republic.
                            Your Excellency lays down as a preliminary question the necessity for
                            the Dominican Government to apply the most-favored nation clause to the
                            United States, in connection with the commercial treaty which it has
                            concluded with France. Reserving the right to discuss this point more
                            fully, we take pleasure in advising Your Excellency that the Dominican
                            Government has expressed its juridical opinion on the matter, as a
                            question of doctrine, but has the greatest desire to arrive at an
                            understanding with the Government of the United States as to the
                            application of that principle.</p>
                        <p>We believe it possible, in conversations on the subject to be held in the
                            near future, to arrive at a satisfactory and harmonious formula, in
                            order to initiate, immediately thereafter, the negotiations for the
                            commercial treaty between the two countries.</p>

                                Government in advance. It is understood that there shall not be
                                considered as contrary to this rule the contracts and financial
                                arrangements made by the Dominican Government for the execution of
                                public works and other services of national interest, provided they
                                be adjusted to the following conditions: firstly, as a guarantee of
                                those contracts or <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0458"
                                />financial arrangements there shall be set aside the revenue from a
                                given impost of the internal revenue service, which therefore does
                                not affect the customs revenue, and the contracting parties must
                                stipulate that they accept that as the sole guarantee for the
                                performance of such obligation; and secondly, the maximum period for
                                the liquidation of any of those contracts may not be greater than
                                four years counting from the date on which the contract goes into
                                effect. The Dominican Government expressly renounces the right that
                                it has to issue new bonds up to the limit of twenty million dollars
                                provided in the 1924 Convention. The Dominican Government may at any
                                time sovereignly dispose of the internal revenues and imposts not
                                set aside for guarantee and payment of the public debt and shall
                                freely dispose of those receipts.</p>

                            <p>The Dominican Government may change its customs tariffs in accordance
                                with the needs and advantage of its commerce, but pledges itself
                                expressly not to reduce import duties at any time to such a point
                                that, taking as a basis exports and imports of the same extent and
                                the same kind for the two years preceding the year in which it is
                                desired to make such modification, the net total of customs receipts
                                under the tariff so modified would not have amounted, for each of
                                the said two years, to at least one and a half times the sum needed
                                to insure the service of interest and amortization of the public
                                debt.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, there shall not be considered contrary to this rule the
                                advantages and reductions in duties which the Dominican Republic may
                                offer to other nations through commercial treaties or agreements and
                                which do not signify an integral lowering of the import tariff,
                                since they relate only to a given country; provided that such
                                reductions may not mean the risk that customs imports may be reduced
                                more than twenty percent, the computation being made from the
                                imports which took place in the two years previous and the numerical
                                proportion having been established by which the total customs
                                revenue could be diminished, if imports were maintained at the same
                                rate.</p>

                                Fiscal Agent and the Department of State of the United States, and
                                the said accounts shall be subject to examination and auditing by

                                channels. For the execution of this provision in each special case,
                                the Contracting Parties may, when the necessity for arbitration has
                                once been determined, conclude a special agreement defining clearly
                                the extent of the disagreement, the extent of the powers of the
                                arbitrators and the periods that are to be fixed for the
                                organization of the arbitral tribunal and the various stages in the
                                proceedings. The special agreement providing for arbitration must be
                                signed in all cases within a period of three months from the date on
                                which either of the Contracting Parties notifies the other
                                Contracting Party of its desire to have recourse to arbitration. It
                                is understood that such special agreements shall be made, on the
                                part of the United States, by the President of the United States, by
                                and with the consent of the Senate, and that, on the part of the
                                Dominican Republic, they shall be subject to the procedure required
                                by its Constitution and laws.</p>

                                files.</note> received yesterday, with its enclosures, being a copy
                            of the Secretary’s memorandum of February 11, 1937 recording a
                            conversation with Ministers Pastoriza and Henríquez Ureña of the
                            Dominican <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0460"/>Republic, and a copy
                            of their note of February 10 [<hi rend="italic">11</hi>] to the
                            Secretary with an attached draft protocol for revision of the
                            American-Dominican Convention of December 27, 1924.</p>
                        <p>In the last two paragraphs of the Dominican note I observe that the
                            readiness of the Dominican Government is intimated to lift the
                            discrimination against American imports here upon the condition that
                            negotiations for a trade agreement with the United States are initiated
                            “immediately thereafter.” Not having seen the Secretary’s note of
                            February 10 to which this intimation seems to be an answer, I can not
                            comment intelligently on this point but venture to refer to my letter to
                            you of February 1<note n="18" xml:id="d461fn18">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> suggesting that the Dominican Government considers the
                            discrimination a useful weapon in its relations with us. Rumors have
                            been current here lately and have perhaps been put out for our benefit
                            that the discrimination will be lifted shortly.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the first part of the Dominican note and the draft
                            protocol, the Dominican Ministers are certainly candid and unmistakable
                            in their statements of their Government’s aspirations. Little seems to
                            have been overlooked in the draft to strip from the holders of Dominican
                            external bonds issued under the Convention of 1924 the last tattered
                            remnant of the guarantees provided in the Convention, save only the good
                            faith of the Dominican Government. That, of course, is much, if we are
                            prepared to rely on it, and calls for no uncharitable comment in view of
                            the record of the Trujillo administration. Nevertheless, in view of the
                            Secretary’s reference to the possible attitude of our Senate towards the
                            proposal, some comments on the draft protocol suggest themselves, as
                            follows: <list>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Article 1</hi>. The phrase “customs duties”
                                    requires explicit definition in view of the Dominican
                                    Government’s past action in the matter of levying customs duties
                                    and so-called internal revenue taxes on imports.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Article 2</hi>. This article makes only
                                    incidental reference to the Fiscal Representative who under the
                                    language used lacks authority to see that the order of payments
                                    is followed.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Article 3</hi>. Under this language the
                                    Fiscal Representative will receive payments to be made by the
                                    Dominican Government but will not collect revenue. This is
                                    confirmed by the contingent power given him in Article 5 to
                                    collect. His role will be a passive one except that he must see
                                    that his office expenses do not normally exceed 3% of customs
                                    collections (presumably excluding internal revenue taxes levied
                                    on imports). If he is to collect, as distinguished from merely
                                    receiving, he will have to be granted the power.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Article 4</hi>. Since the supervisory powers
                                    of the Fiscal Representative as defined in this Article are
                                    illusory, the statistical service to be <pb n="451"
                                        xml:id="pg_451" facs="0461"/>rendered by him can not be
                                    effective. His ineffectiveness is greatly increased by the
                                    second paragraph of this Article which precludes his control
                                    over his own subordinates.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Article 5</hi>. Is our Government to
                                    determine when the Fiscal Representative shall take charge of
                                    customs houses? If so, this should be stated. But this seems not
                                    to be the intent of the language used.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Article 6</hi>. Due regard to the
                                    sovereignty of the Dominican Republic would, of course, counsel
                                    acceptance of this Article if the trusteeship for the creditors
                                    is to be vested in the debtor government.</item>

                                    of the draft protocol becomes almost superfluous. I see no
                                    middle course between accepting and rejecting it.</item>

                                    is obscure and its meaning uncertain but the considerations

                                    much “eye-wash.” We have shown (my despatch No. 3511 of

                                    Further, it seems inadvisable to insert in the protocol the “one
                                    and one half” protective provision, since the external funded
                                    debt service in 1936 required only 39% of customs revenue
                                    (excluding internal revenue taxes on imports) or about 10.6% of
                                    the Dominican Government’s total budget, and the cost of the

                        <p>These comments suggest the essential modifications which would have to be
                            made in the proposed protocol if it is decided that the Fiscal
                            Representative shall have real power to safeguard the interests of the
                            bondholders. If, however, he is not to interfere with control by the
                            Dominican Government over all its fiscal operations, the Dominican draft
                            would seem to require but little change or, better said, it is evident
                            that the Dominican proposals offer a practicable basis for an agreement
                            upon the hypothesis that the Fiscal Representative is to be a screen for
                            complete fiscal autonomy in this Republic.</p>
                        <p>I presume it would be possible to have the proposed Dominican National
                            Bank perform the functions of the Fiscal Representative unless the bank
                            scheme has recently been changed. In that event, it seems to be a case
                            of putting the cart before the horse to discuss the proposed protocol (I
                            should call it a treaty) in advance of the establishment of the National
                            Bank and consultation with the management of the proposed Bank. The
                            timeliness of the proposals embodied in the draft protocol is
                            correspondingly doubtful.</p>
                        <p>The present urgency of the Dominican Government in pressing for the
                            conclusion of the protocol and in responding so promptly to the
                            Secretary’s solicitation of proposals for revision of the Convention of
                            1924, is perhaps to be explained by the fact that the 1936 fiscal year
                            ended with an operating deficit of nearly half a million dollars (see my
                            strictly confidential despatch No. 3778 of February 22, 1937<note n="22"
                                xml:id="d461fn22">Not printed.</note>). It is doubtless a source of
                            no little anxiety to President Trujillo to achieve the settlement
                            represented by the proposed protocol and to achieve it at once. He feels
                            he must have even greater freedom than at present to manipulate the
                            finances, aside from the conspicuous political triumph the conclusion of
                            such an agreement would afford him.</p>
                        <p>There is still, so far as I can see, no half-way station between
                            enforcement and abandonment of the Convention of 1924. We have not
                            enforced it. On the presumption that we will not enforce it, I see no
                            advantage nor even international honesty in keeping up the fiction that
                            the two governments concerned are governed by it. At the same time, I am
                            well aware that the fiction remains a solace to a considerable body of
                            informed opinion, not to mention bondholders and floating debt creditors
                            of the Dominican Government.</p>

                            far as the elimination of the Receivership General is concerned, until
                            they can determine, in their opinion, whether it is practicable to
                            obtain the creation of an Executive Committee of the bondholders, and to
                            negotiate without further delay a convention modifying the Convention of
                            1924 in those points which relate to the Dominican tariff and to the

                            or other services of national interest, providing they are adjusted to

                            Convention. The Dominican Government may, at any time, freely dispose of
                            the internal revenues and imposts not pledged as a guarantee for the
                            payment of the public debt.</p>

                        <p>The fourth clause of the same Convention of 1924 shall read as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The Dominican Government may modify its customs tariffs in accordance
                            with the needs and advantage of its commerce, but pledges itself
                            expressly not to reduce import duties at any time to such a point that,
                            taking as a basis exports and imports of the same extent and kind during
                            the two years preceding the year in which it is desired to make such
                            modification, the net total customs receipts, according to the tariff so
                            modified, would not have amounted for each of the said two years, to at
                            least one and one-half times the sum necessary to insure the service of
                            the interest and amortization of its public debt, unless the said
                            Dominican Government shall have previously segregated from the proceeds
                            of its internal revenues, and special imposts which are not pledged, as
                            are the customs duties, to the payment of the debt, an amount equivalent
                            to the reduction in total customs revenues resulting from the proposed
                            modifications of its customs tariff. In such event, the Dominican
                            Government will not need to be guided by the formula stipulated; and on
                            the twentieth of each calendar month shall place at the disposal of the
                            General Receiver of Customs, a sum, segregated from its internal
                            revenues and special imposts, equivalent to one-twelfth of the amount by
                            which the annual customs revenues of the Republic shall have been
                            diminished as a result of such customs tariff modification.</p>
                        <p>The present protocol complementary to the Convention of December 27,
                            1924, shall be ratified by the high contracting parties in accordance
                            with their respective constitutional methods, and will enter into force
                            as soon as the exchange of ratifications shall have been effected and
                            will have the same duration as the said Convention may have.</p>
                        <p>In witness whereof the plenipotentiaries have signed this protocol in

                            initiate conversations with Your Excellency, in January of this year,
                            together with Minister Henríquez Ureña, towards a complete revision of
                            the 1924 Convention between the Dominican Republic and the United States
                                <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0472"/>of America, I was deeply
                            satisfied to hear Your Excellency express the sincere desire of the
                            United States Government, in harmony with the “Good Neighbor” policy, to
                            eliminate the said international instrument, which is the inheritance of
                            the past.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency thus confirmed with encouraging words the feeling which
                            had already been expressed in Your Excellency’s note of February 10,
                            1937, and set forth a fact of vital importance for the progress of such
                            conversations, namely, that however deeply interested the Dominican
                            Republic may be in recovering its full economic sovereignty, at present
                            restricted in several aspects by certain provisions of the said
                            Convention, which was consented to by previous representatives of the
                            Republic at a time when conditions in our life as a nation were
                            different—the interest of the United States Government is just as great
                            toward freeing itself from the embarrassing interference implied by the
                            assistance which it agreed to lend to the Dominican Republic and which
                            at a given moment may have been considered necessary.</p>
                        <p>It is evident, therefore, that both our Governments coincide in
                            considering the complete revision of the 1924 Convention as vitally
                            essential to our reciprocal advantage, and in particular, the
                            substitution of the machinery which it provides for the service of the
                            Dominican public debt, inasmuch as the Convention and the organization
                            thereby established are an obstacle to the free development of a
                            broad-minded economic policy in the Republic; require the Government to
                            surrender constitutional powers and prerogatives, which is contrary to
                            the spirit and to the letter of the Constitution itself; and result in
                            intervention on the part of the Government of the United States in the
                            internal affairs of the Dominican nation. The Dominican Republic has
                            valued to the extent of its worth, such assistance as has been rendered
                            to it by the United States Government, because that assistance was
                            requested by the Dominican Republic itself at a time now past; but the
                            Dominican Government recognizes that the desire of the Government of the
                            United States to free itself from the obligations and duties which the
                            continuance of such assistance would entail, is fully justified,
                            particularly so because, as a result of a radical change of conditions
                            in our country, such help is no longer required.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, in accordance with such identical purposes and desires on
                            the part of both Governments, conversations tending to the desired end
                            have taken place at the State Department from January to date, but
                            neither the first draft which we submitted for a proposed Convention,
                            nor a counter-project submitted by the State Department, have permitted
                            reaching an agreement acceptable to both parties; nor do we feel that
                            any additional progress may be made through our suggestion <pb n="463"
                                xml:id="pg_463" facs="0473"/>that the various points involved be
                            separated in studying the problem before us, and that each be made the
                            object of a separate convention, for even thus we have not been
                            successful in reaching satisfactory formulae.</p>
                        <p>The Dominican Republic, in stating its desire to relieve the Government
                            of the United States from the obligation to give assistance, and which
                            it requested and obtained from that Government, is anxious to arrive at
                            definite formulae which will eliminate all intervention on the part of
                            the United States Government in our national economy. The methods thus
                            far studied do not definitely solve the problem, and my Government
                            consequently feels that it is preferable not to continue to take any of
                            the drafts which have been submitted by either party as a basis of
                            negotiation, and proposes to submit new suggestions to the United States
                            Government in the near future, in order to continue the negotiations
                            from a different point of view.</p>
                        <p>In announcing this intention to Your Excellency for consideration at an
                            early opportunity, I avail myself [etc.]</p>

                        <p>When the Dominican Minister was in to see me on Friday he mentioned that
                            he was preparing a note to the Department on the subject of the
                            negotiations to terminate the Convention of 1924. In the attached
                                note<note n="24" xml:id="d466fn24"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Supra</hi>.</note> he states that his Government intends to submit
                            “new suggestions” in the future as a basis of negotiation. Orally the
                            Minister informed me that these suggestions would be along the line of
                            the bank plan regarding which we have been negotiating with Haiti. The
                            Government apparently intends to proceed immediately to purchase the
                            bank, and once having acquired the bank will propose that the bank
                            handle the collection and disbursement of customs. The Minister inquired
                            whether the proposed bank contract looked satisfactory. I told him that
                            if he meant satisfactory from the standpoint of the new plan which the
                            Government has in mind for customs collections and disbursements the
                            Department would have to give very careful consideration to it. The
                            Minister then said that he would not suggest further study of the
                            contract until after the Department had received his new
                            suggestions.</p>

                            continue negotiations for the modification of the United
                            States-Dominican Convention of 1924 upon the basis of the drafts which
                            have recently been exchanged, but proposes to submit new suggestions in

                        <p>The Dominican Minister called by appointment to see Mr. Duggan in
                            connection with his suggested additions to the draft protocol amending
                            the 1924 Convention between the United States and the Dominican
                            Republic.</p>
                        <p>In response to questioning Señor Pastoriza stated that his most recent
                            suggestions were not to be taken by themselves as a protocol, but were
                            to be incorporated with the previous suggestions for a protocol amending
                            the Convention submitted by him and by Dr. Enríquez Ureña. Señor
                            Pastoriza stated that the latest suggestions were purely unofficial and
                            represented merely his own ideas since they had not been officially
                            approved by his Government. Mr. Chapin pointed out that it was a little
                            difficult to analyze the suggestions as they stood by themselves and
                            that it would be preferable to see them physically incorporated with the
                            other draft and to examine the modified draft as a whole. Señor
                            Pastoriza stated he appreciated this and that this would be done
                            subsequent to his return to the Dominican Republic. He added that he
                            expected to leave at almost any time. Señor Pastoriza, <pb n="466"
                                xml:id="pg_466" facs="0476"/>in response to a question from Mr.
                            Duggan, said that he was quite willing to insert another paragraph in
                            his suggestions covering the rights and duties of the “Fiscal
                            Representative” who was to replace the General Receiver of Customs. It
                            was his idea that while the actual running of the customs would pass to
                            the Dominican Government, the Fiscal Representative to be appointed by
                            the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council would have the right to
                            inspect at all times and to make known his recommendations to the
                            Dominican Government. Señor Pastoriza was somewhat evasive as regards
                            Mr. Duggan’s direct question whether the Dominican Government would
                            consider itself bound to accept the suggestions and recommendations of
                            the Fiscal Representative in the case of the report of irregularities of
                            other similar defects in the administration of the customs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan then presented Señor Pastoriza with copies of our latest trade

                            to look them over, paying particular attention to the general
                            provisions. Señor Pastoriza promised that he would refer them to his
                            Government upon his return to the Dominican Republic with a view to
                            determining whether the general provisions were satisfactory in
                            principle to the Government. Mr. Duggan explained to the Minister that
                            we were prepared to go ahead with exploratory conversations on a trade
                            agreement touching these general provisions but that pending the final
                            outcome of the sugar legislation nothing could be done with respect to
                            granting a concession to the Dominican Republic on sugar or sugar
                            products.</p>

                            forwarded last night reporting Foreign Minister’s intention to reopen
                            negotiations for revision of the 1924 convention on basis of preliminary
                            consideration of the floating debt problem and respect for United States
                            responsibility to bondholders. <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0477"
                            />My reply to him was along the same lines as your press statement. An
                            editorial in this morning’s <hi rend="italic">Listin</hi> refers to the
                            convention as an “anachronism” and asks if the United States should not
                            evidence its interest in the cancellation of this arrangement. No
                            reference was made to your statement, a summary of which was published
                            here yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Although the Foreign Minister tells me he was appointed by the President
                            with the sole purpose of negotiating a revision of the 1924 convention,
                            I feel that the primary reason for drafting him to the Foreign Office
                            was the threatening situation with Haiti.<note n="30" xml:id="d470fn30"
                                >See <ref target="#pg_132">pp. 132</ref> ff.</note> I also am of the
                            opinion that this sudden cry for revision is an attempt to draw
                            attention from the Dominican-Haitian dispute by evoking a fancied
                            grievance against the United States.</p>

                        <p>32. The demands of the armed forces to strengthen the Government
                            culminated today in the resignation of the Cabinet. Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs and Minister of Public Works will probably continue in office
                            but military officers will replace the others. It is reliably reported
                            that the President is resentful of the interference of the military and
                            their opposition to the holding of the Assembly and that there will be
                            further developments.</p>

                        <p>62. Referring to my telegram No. 61, October 23, 9 a.m., <hi
                                rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> consummated without any apparent
                            opposition. Three army officers have been appointed to the Cabinet
                            including the previous Minister of Finance who is acting as Foreign
                            Minister. In view of the announced intention to remove corrupt elements
                            which was the ostensible reason for the movement, many changes in
                            Government officers are expected.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as constitutional succession was disregarded the question of
                            recognition arises upon which I shall report fully.</p>

                            your opinion the new government has the substantial support of public
                            opinion in Ecuador, whether it is able to discharge the normal functions
                            of government, whether it is capable of maintaining public order and
                            whether it intends to comply with its international obligations.</p>

                            discreetly as to recognition of new government by other nations having

                        <p>The Ambassador of Ecuador<note n="4" xml:id="d476fn4">Colón Eloy
                                Alfaro.</note> called to see me this morning. The Ambassador read to
                            me two cables which he had just received from his Government in which it
                            was made clear that the Ambassador would be requested to stay on in his
                            present capacity in Washington, although most of the other diplomatic
                            representatives of Ecuador abroad would have their resignations
                            accepted. Captain Alfaro made it evident to me that he is on the most
                            intimate personal relations with Colonel Enriquez, the new head of the
                            Government of Ecuador. He stated that in his judgment Colonel Enriquez
                            would be a more efficient president under present conditions than his
                            predecessor, although he expressed the greatest admiration and
                            confidence in the integrity of ex-President Paez.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that the cabinet was now complete with the
                            exception of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and he told me that he
                            understood that Señor Francisco Guarderas, former Minister of Ecuador in
                            Brazil and one of the delegates of Ecuador at the Buenos Aires

                            stated that the new set-up involved no change in political color. He
                            said that the new President was very open minded and pacific with regard
                            to the settlement of the boundary controversy with Peru.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d476fn6">See <ref target="#pg_46">pp. 46</ref> ff.</note> In
                            that connection he said that he was urging that the three Ecuadorean
                            delegates engaged in the negotiations in Washington be continued in
                            office.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that no change in policy with regard to the Vatican
                            would be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>He expressed concern at the report that all political refugees would be
                            permitted to return to Ecuador … would inevitably promote disturbances.
                            In conclusion he said, however, that he anticipated a period of complete
                            quiet and stability for some months to come and that he intended himself
                            before long to fly down to Ecuador for a personal summary of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had no instructions to ask recognition, and I replied
                            that for the time being we were in a position of expectancy in order
                            that we might determine our own policy with regard to recognition. I
                            made it evident that the sole considerations this Government would have
                            in mind would be the substantial support <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471"
                                facs="0481"/>on the part of the people of Ecuador for the new
                            Government, the ability of the new regime to maintain public order and
                            to carry out the normal functions of government, and its determination
                            to comply with its international obligations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In confirmation of my telegrams No. 61 of
                            October 23, 9 a.m., 1937, and No. 62 of October 24, 4 p.m., 1937, I have
                            the honor to report that the political situation which became acute on
                            October 18th with the resignation of General G. Alberto Enriquez,
                            Minister of National Defense, culminated on the morning of October 23rd
                            in the resignation of the Acting Constitutional President, Federico
                            Páez, the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, and the assumption of
                            the Supreme Power by General Enriquez.</p>
                        <p>It is still not certain as to what were the fundamental reasons which
                            caused the change in Government. The most persistent reports are that
                            during the celebrations at Guayaquil on October 9th, which were attended
                            by the President and most of the Cabinet, General Enriquez was informed
                            by certain prominent persons of that city of many incorrections in the
                            Government involving malfeasance of office, bribery and graft. One or
                            two notable cases were reported … It is said that upon the return of
                            General Enriquez he prepared a four hundred page report setting forth
                            the charges against different officers which was submitted to the
                            consideration of President Páez. Apparently the action taken by the
                            President was not satisfactory to General Enriquez who resigned on the
                            18th of October and left the city. President Páez went to the country
                            place of Enriquez that evening and induced him to withdraw his
                            resignation. The only information reported in the press during the
                            following days was to the effect that the resignation had been due to a
                            difference of opinion on administrative matters.</p>
                        <p>However, on the evening of October 22nd it was apparent that the
                            situation had reached a point where important developments must follow.
                            It is reported that General Enriquez, supported by the Minister of
                            Finance, insisted upon the immediate removal of many Government and
                            Semi-Government officials and the immediate dissolution of the
                            Constituent Assembly. It is understood that President Páez was disposed
                            to accede to the first suggestion, but that <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472"
                                facs="0482"/>as concerned the Assembly he categorically refused to
                            take any steps looking toward its dissolution. He held that the Assembly
                            was entirely of his making and that, therefore, he could not and would
                            not dissolve it. The Department will recall that the Armed Forces were
                            never in accord with the convocation of the Assembly. It is reported
                            that while Colonel Salgado, the Minister of Government, and
                            Lieutenant-Colonel Guerrero, the Minister of Social Prevision, were
                            opposed to the holding of the Assembly, they were of the opinion that
                            the Assembly should not now be dissolved. This opposition to General
                            Enriquez subsequently resulted in the retirement of these two officers
                            from the Government.</p>
                        <p>The exact nature of the dissatisfaction of General Enriquez with the
                            Assembly is not yet clear. It is reported that he was primarily
                            displeased with the fact that the Assembly has been in session some two
                            months without accomplishing anything definite. Also, individual members
                            were accused of improper practices contrary to the best interests of the
                            State. However, more important was the fact that the Assembly was not
                            representative of the country in view of the abstention of the organized
                            political parties in its election.</p>
                        <p>An important factor in the developments of Saturday morning was that
                            President Páez was not at all desirous of continuing as the Chief
                            Executive of the Nation which position he has made clear on innumerable
                            occasions both publicly and privately. It is reliably reported that if
                            he had wished to continue in power he could have done so since he had
                            the support of the majority of the armed forces. He finally decided that
                            he would withdraw and he presented his resignation to the Constituent
                            Assembly which had appointed him Constitutional President <hi
                                rend="italic">ad interim</hi>. Upon this decision a committee of ten
                            high army officers resolved to allow General Enriquez to assume the
                            Supreme Power and to ignore the Constituent Assembly. The decree
                            announcing this action stated that General Enriquez had assumed the
                            Supreme Power pending the convocation of a new Assembly elected by the
                            duly organized political parties. A further decree adopted the 1906
                            Constitution in so far as its provisions are not contrary to the
                            purposes of the new Government.</p>
                        <p>The situation on Saturday morning was potentially critical in view of the
                            fact that division of opinion existed among the armed forces. It is
                            reported that the majority preferred that President Páez continue as the
                            head of the Government. However, when the President made it clear that
                            he was determined to retire to private life, this had a steadying
                            influence on subsequent developments.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the day a Manifesto was issued stating the reasons
                            why the Army had again assumed the Supreme Power. The substance of this
                            statement was that the Government had degenerated <pb n="473"
                                xml:id="pg_473" facs="0483"/>into cliques which were enriching
                            themselves at the expense of the nation.</p>
                        <p>In view of the decision of the President to withdraw, all of the Cabinet
                            remained loyal to Páez and resigned, with the exception of
                            Lieutenant-Colonel Heliodoro Sáenz who was immediately reappointed
                            Minister of Finance and temporarily charged with the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs. Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Quintana was appointed Minister of
                            Government and Colonel Guillermo Freile Cruz, Chief of Staff, was
                            appointed Minister of National Defense. It is generally understood that
                            General Enriquez desires Carlos Manuel Larrea, the former Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, to continue in that post. The latter, out of personal
                            loyalty to President Páez, has repeatedly refused but this morning’s
                            press indicates that he will probably accept.</p>
                        <p>The President of the Constituent Assembly, Alberto Donoso Cobo, was
                            arrested. He was subsequently released but yesterday he was again put in
                            prison. The nature of the charges against him have not been revealed.
                            Alberto Wither Navarro, President of the Central Bank of Ecuador and
                            former Minister of Finance, has also been arrested. The Government
                            revealed that the charges against him are in connection with a decree
                            issued while he was Minister of Finance involving the payment of 400,000
                            sucres by the Government to the Central Bank. This morning’s press
                            contains a statement by the Directors of that bank which indicates that
                            the transaction was entirely correct. Under the circumstances it is
                            thought that Mr. Wither is being held in prison because of his outspoken
                            antipathy toward General Enriquez. It is known that these two gentlemen
                            have had many personal disagreements because of the excessive
                            expenditures by General Enriquez for armaments. Also, it is reliably
                            reported that Mr. Wither actively advocated armed resistance to the
                            pretentions of General Enriquez to assume power on the morning of
                            October 23rd.</p>
                        <p>It is anticipated from current reports that the Board of Directors of the
                            Central Bank as well as that of the Mortgage Bank will be required to
                            resign. A commission has already been appointed to investigate the
                            operations of the former and a like one will probably be designated in
                            the near future to examine into the affairs of the Mortgage Bank. It is
                            expected that other committees will investigate the contracts concluded
                            by the former Minister of Public Works with the purpose of determining
                            whether they are to the best interests of the State and, particularly,
                            whether there has been any bribery. The Scotoni contract<note n="8"

                        <p>63. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 48, October 27, 7 p.m. Carlos
                            Manuel Larrea took office today as Minister for Foreign Affairs and has
                            sent a note informing me of the change of government. He states that
                            complete tranquility and order prevails and that the Ecuadorean
                            Government in its foreign relations “proposes to continue its policy of
                            respect for law and the inviolability of international treaties and
                            conventions. It desires to offer to all nations its friendly cooperation
                            for the normal development of cultural and commercial interchange and
                            for the preservation of peace and progress.” He concludes with the
                            statement that his Government will be pleased to continue cultivating
                            the good relations of friendship which it happily maintains with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The situation is not yet sufficiently clarified to permit a categorical
                            answer on the points raised by the Department. However, consensus of
                            opinion seems to be that the new regime is not competent to cope with
                            the situation and that open dissension may develop within the armed
                            forces. For the moment public opinion is apathetic and awaiting
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>Diplomatic Corps with the exception of the French seems reluctant to make
                            favorable recommendation.</p>

                        <p>64. Referring to my telegram No. 63, October 28, 8 p.m., Colombia and
                            Mexico recognized yesterday. Peru, Great Britain, Panama, and Venezuela
                            have indicated that they are awaiting action by the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is still not certain that present stability will continue for any
                            considerable period. Attempts to reform, to punish former officials, <pb
                                n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0485"/>and to lower the price of
                            foodstuffs naturally will elicit opposition in some circles, but it is
                            believed these measures will receive general approval. The holding of
                            new elections would obtain the support of the political parties but this
                            step probably will not be taken within the near future. Consequently it
                            is my opinon that a military dictatorship under one guise or another
                            will continue in power in Ecuador for some time to come with possible
                            occasional changes in the supreme chief. The question, therefore, would
                            seem to be the recognition of that form of government which apparently
                            is accepted by the people of Ecuador because (1st) they have no other
                            choice and (2d) they seem resigned to the fact that constitutional
                            government cannot be had. Accordingly we shall probably have to continue
                            to deal with this form of government.</p>

                            Legation at Quito of the change in government. By means of a note signed
                            by the Minister of Foreign Affairs it advises this Government that
                            complete tranquillity and order prevail and that the Government of
                            Ecuador in its foreign relations “proposes to continue its policy of

                        <p>56. Department’s telegram No. 29, October 29, 3 p.m.<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d481fn10">See footnote 9, above.</note> The following very
                            confidential information has been obtained this morning <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0486"/>from the Minister of Foreign Affairs:
                            Some days ago the Papal Nuncio in Quito suggested to the Colombian
                            Minister that Colombia and the Vatican join in extending formal
                            recognition to the new regime. The purpose of this suggestion was
                            apparently to counteract opposition in Ecuadoran radical circles to the
                            recent <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> between the Vatican and
                            Ecuador the negotiation of which was supported by Colombia with a view
                            to improving its position as respects the revision of its own concordat
                            since the Vatican could hardly refuse to Colombia concessions made to
                            Ecuador. Under date of October 26 the Colombian Government instructed
                            its Minister in Quito that while neither formal nor joint recognition
                            was contemplated he was authorized to extend <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> recognition by continuing normal relations with the
                            Ecuadoran Foreign Office. He was further authorized to inform General
                            Enriquez that Colombia would view with satisfaction the continuation of
                            Ecuador’s friendly relations with the church as provided for in the
                            recent <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>. As respects the outlook for
                            the new regime the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that on the whole
                            his impression is favorable and that according to his information
                            General Enriquez was as Minister of War the real power in the former
                            regime, that he seeks for his new government a broader basis of popular
                            support by enlisting the cooperation of the various parties instead of
                            relying entirely on the army and that barring untoward contingencies
                            such a regime should offer better prospects of stability than the
                            previous one.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Chile called upon me today by instruction of his
                            Government. The Ambassador said that the Government of Chile was
                            preoccupied with the possible difficulties that might arise in the
                            negotiations between Peru and Ecuador for the settlement of their
                            boundary controversy as a result of the installation of the new
                            government headed by Colonel Enriquez in Ecuador. The Ambassador asked
                            if I would let him have the views of this Government with regard to the
                            extension of recognition to the new regime.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that his coming was a very happy coincidence, since
                            on Saturday evening I had made exactly the same move vis-à-vis Chile by
                            sending a cable to our Ambassador in Santiago asking him to inquire of
                            the Government of Chile what its views in this same matter might be. I
                            told the Ambassador of the reply received today from Ambassador Philip
                            and expressed my particular appreciation of the friendly advice and
                            information given us by his Government. I said that in view of the
                            information received, this Government had determined to instruct the
                            American Minister in Quito tomorrow, November 2, to advise the new
                            government of Ecuador that the United States was pleased to continue
                            friendly relations with that Government. The Ambassador expressed his
                            gratitude for the information given and said that he would at once cable
                            his Government in that sense.</p>

                            Argentina, Brazil and Chile as to recognition of the new Ecuadoran
                            Government, is awaiting action by them. Because of the boundary dispute
                            Peru does not wish to take independent action which can be construed as
                            having been occasioned by the boundary question. Brazil having already
                            acted, it is probable that if Argentina and Chile recognize, Peru will
                            promptly do the same.</p>
                        <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0488"/>
                        <p>The Peruvian Government has purposely not consulted the United States on
                            the subject of recognition in order not to embarrass Washington in view
                            of its position in the boundary question.</p>
                        <p>Although disturbed moderately by reports of continued arming in Ecuador,
                            parades with inflammatory speeches and a new military government, Peru
                            will not seek to hinder recognition in any way and will follow the lead
                            of the other South American countries.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian Government is satisfied with the new Ecuadoran Government
                            and insofar as it is able to appraise the present situation, has
                            confidence in its probable stability. There is no evidence in Government
                            or army circles of any intention to take any action as a result of the
                            change of Government in Ecuador which might tend to aggravate the
                            boundary dispute. There have been no unusual military movements or
                            purchases of arms and munitions and virtually no newspaper comment.</p>

                            his Government in its foreign relations intends to pursue the same
                            policy as that employed by the preceding Government, and that it is his
                            understanding that the present delegates of Ecuador in the Washington
                            boundary negotiations will be retained in that capacity. I am not
                            advised of any particular difficulties now envisaged.</p>

                            No. 50 of November 2, 12 noon, 1937, I have the honor to transmit
                            herewith a copy of the note<note n="13" xml:id="d490fn13">Not
                                printed.</note> presented to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in

                            will be forwarded to the Department.</p>
                        <p>I am annexing two articles<note n="13a" xml:id="d490fn13a">Not
                                reprinted.</note> which appeared in the local newspapers, <hi
                                rend="italic">El Comercio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">El Dia</hi>,
                            this morning emanating from the Associated Press in the case of <hi
                                rend="italic">El Comercio</hi> and that from <hi rend="italic">El
                                Dia</hi> from an unknown source. It is quite significant that these
                            newspapers apparently had information that the United States Government
                            was going to recognize Ecuador before this Legation had an opportunity
                            to even receive or decipher the cable, and it is surprising how the
                            local <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0491"/>newspapers were able to
                            obtain this information before it was officially received here. You will
                            note from the article attached and which appeared in <hi rend="italic"
                                >El Dia</hi> that the wording is the same as the concluding
                            statement of the cable. Whether or not said wording was obtained locally
                            from the cable of the Department before receipt thereof by the Legation
                            is not known but does seem strange. From information gathered it seems
                            that everyone here knew of the contemplated action to be taken by our
                            Government before knowledge thereof was brought to this Legation, and
                            especially in view of the fact that in the Department’s cable No. 48 of
                            October 27, 7 p.m., it was stated that pending authorization from the
                            Department, which meant receipt, that no action should be taken which
                            might be construed as constituting recognition.</p>

                            and that I would receive a note on the following day confirming his
                            assurance. Accordingly, I sent my telegram No. 63, December 29th, 7

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report the substance
                            of an informal conversation which I had this afternoon with Dr.
                            Francisco Banda, Chief of the Commercial and Consular Section of the
                            Ecuadorean Foreign Office. The conversation is of importance inasmuch as
                            Dr. Banda is the presiding officer of the Permanent Committee for
                            Studying Commercial Treaties (see despatch No. 366, May 12, 1936<note
                                n="18" xml:id="d492fn18">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation Dr. Banda stated that he desired to
                            talk with me regarding the contemplated trade agreement with Ecuador,
                            and particularly our unconditional most-favored-nation clause. After
                            going into considerable detail in describing the trade relations and
                            policy of his Government, he finally inquired whether it would be
                            feasible to grant the customs concessions which the United States might
                            seek in such a manner as would avoid the publication of the agreement.
                            He frankly admitted that the purpose in view was to avoid publicity so
                            that other nations enjoying most-favored-nation treatment with Ecuador
                            might not request the extension to them of the concessions granted.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. Banda that this was a matter upon which I should have to
                            consult with the Department. However, I did point out that in my
                            personal opinion agreements concluded under the authority of the Trade
                            Agreements Act must be publicly proclaimed by the President of the
                            United States before becoming effective, and that this procedure, if
                            correct, would seem to preclude the conclusion of a secret trade
                            agreement. It did not seem necessary to point out how impossible it
                            would be to maintain such an agreement secret, but I did feel it
                            desirable to reiterate the principles of American commercial policy
                            which also seem to preclude the contemplation of the <pb n="483"
                                xml:id="pg_483" facs="0493"/>procedure proposed. I explained that
                            our policy is based upon the principle of non-discriminatory treatment
                            in view of which we neither ask nor accord preferential discriminatory
                            treatment. In fact, through the application of our unconditional
                            most-favored-nation clause, we automatically extend to all nations not
                            discriminating against our trade the concessions we grant to any third
                            country. I added that while we are primarily concerned with the
                            treatment which Ecuador will accord to our commerce by virtue of the
                            contemplated trade agreement, namely, that certain reductions in customs
                            rates are granted and equality of treatment is assured on advantages now
                            or in the future granted to any third country, I felt that my
                            Government, in line with its commercial policy, could not view with
                            favor the negotiation of a secret trade agreement providing for a
                            preferential discriminatory treatment for American products.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Banda then stated that as our trade leaves an active balance for
                            Ecuador, the United States is entitled to enjoy under Ecuadorean
                            commercial policy the treatment granted to the most favored nation.
                            Moreover, it is the desire of his country to grant us the concessions
                            that may interest us. However, it wishes to consider such concessions as
                            bilateral and not extend them to all countries. He added in this
                            connection that Ecuador has already denied the extension to Germany of
                            the Chilean advantages (see despatch No. 563 of October 13, 1936<note
                                n="20" xml:id="d492fn20">Not printed.</note>), and that his
                            Government has maintained that position.</p>
                        <p>The question raised by Dr. Banda is complicated in some respects. From
                            one point of view it would be advantageous to the United States if
                            Ecuador refused to extend the tariff concessions it may grant to the
                            United States, but I am convinced that the Department would not be
                            prepared to enter into a secret agreement for such concessions. Also,
                            instruction No. 114 of March 27, 1936,<note n="20" xml:id="d492fn21">Not
                                printed.</note> indicates clearly that our commercial policy is to
                            discourage preferential discriminatory treatment, as such an agreement
                            must necessarily provide, with the ultimate objective of re-establishing
                            triangular or multilateral international trade as opposed to the
                            bilateral theory.</p>
                        <p>In my despatch No. 563 of October 13, 1936, I reported the remarks of Dr.
                            Banda with regard to his interpretation of the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation principle. It is my impression that Dr. Banda
                            understands well the principle involved, and that he is simply and
                            hopefully seeking some formula which will permit the inclusion in our
                            contemplated agreement of the conflicting principles of Ecuadorean
                            preferential discriminatory treatment and American non-discriminatory
                            treatment.</p>
                        <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0494"/>
                        <p>While I do not anticipate any difficulty, I should appreciate having the
                            Department’s instructions in the premises in the event that Dr. Banda
                            should again bring up the question. The Department may desire to have it
                            clearly understood in an informal manner that we should prefer that
                            Ecuador made no exception in the application of the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation principle with other countries with the end in view
                            that such precedents might not later be adduced as vitiating the
                            principle. We recognize that such interpretation or application is a
                            matter for Ecuador to determine according to its national interests.
                            However, as concerns the application of the principle in
                            American-Ecuadorean trade relations, we are vitally concerned and are
                            agreed that in the application thereof no exception is admissible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to previous despatches
                            reporting the desire of Ecuador to obtain a reduction in the existing
                            customs duties on naranjilla juice imported into the United States, I
                            have the honor to state that steps are now being taken with a view to
                            cultivating this fruit on a large scale for export purposes. A company
                            has already been organized, “Compañía Naranjillera del Ecuador, S. A.,”
                            which has concluded with the Government of Ecuador a contract providing
                            for the special privileges authorized by the Law of October 5,
                                1921,<note n="22" xml:id="d493fn22">Ecuador, <hi rend="italic"

                                    rend="smallcaps">i</hi> (Quito, 1922), p. 158.</note> for
                            companies attempting to establish new industries in the country. This
                            contract is published in the <hi rend="italic">Registro Oficial</hi> No.
                            377 of December 30, 1936, the date of the agreement. Under the terms of
                            the contract the company is exempted for a period of ten years from the
                            payment of import duties on all machinery and supplies necessary for the
                            development of the industry, and of export taxes.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that Dr. Guerrero Martinez, who holds the fishing and
                            hunting concession in the Galapagos Islands, is at present negotiating
                            with the company. It is understood that he would attempt to interest a
                            large American company which would furnish the capital necessary to
                            develop immediately the cultivation of the naranjilla on a large scale.
                            The said company would undertake to introduce the naranjilla in the
                            United States and commit itself to purchase the entire output of the
                            Ecuadorean company. Dr. Guerrero <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0495"
                            />expressed the belief that the bases exist for a mutually profitable
                            business provided that a substantial reduction can be obtained in the
                            present import duties on fruit juices.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing and previous conversations I have had with the
                            authorities on this subject, it is my opinion that Ecuador will exhibit
                            considerable interest in obtaining a reduction in the present duties on
                            naranjilla juice which are understood to be seventy cents per gallon,
                            plus five dollars per proof gallon on the alcoholic content. I further
                            believe that if it is at all feasible to grant an appreciable concession
                            on this article, it will facilitate considerably obtaining concessions
                            in this country on articles in which we may be interested.</p>

                            consider the granting of concessions to Ecuador, such list to accompany

                            and fixing dates for the presentation of formal briefs and for oral
                            hearings.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to ask the Ecuadoran Government to submit as soon as
                            possible descriptions of any products, in addition to those it has
                            already brought to this Government’s attention (as reported in your
                            despatch No. 632 of December 14, 1936<note n="25" xml:id="d494fn25"><ref

                            tariff reductions or bindings in the agreement. You should point out to
                            the Ecuadoran Government in this connection that the general practice of
                            the United States is to limit the concessions which it grants to a
                            country to products of which that country supplies a principal or an
                            important proportion of the total imports of each of such products into
                            the United States. Bearing this general practice in mind the list
                            submitted by the Ecuadoran Government <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486"
                                facs="0496"/>should be established with as great care as possible
                            since it will be difficult to add any new items to it once it has been
                            made public. It should however be clearly understood that the proposed
                            publication of a list of products in connection with the formal
                            announcement of intention to negotiate a trade agreement will not
                            constitute a commitment by this Government to grant concessions in
                            respect of all of the products so listed. The purpose of publishing the
                            list is to give notice to the American public of all the products under
                            consideration as possible subjects for the granting of concessions to
                            Ecuador, in order that all interested parties may know whether there is
                            occasion for presentation of their views.</p>

                            of the Foreign Office note of the same date setting forth the products
                            in which Ecuador is interested in obtaining bindings or tariff
                            reductions in the contemplated agreement. It is not thought that the
                            Ecuadorean Government will desire to add further items to that list, but
                            I shall inform the Department definitely as soon as I receive a reply to
                            my note.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs I felt it
                            desirable to explain to him our procedure in negotiating such agreements
                            since the Minister was not familiar with it as he has been devoting
                            practically his entire time to the boundary negotiations<note n="29"
                                xml:id="d495fn29">See <ref target="#pg_46">pp. 46</ref> ff.</note>
                            in Washington. The Department may be interested to learn that the
                            Minister expressed unqualified admiration of this, what he termed,
                            “unique and practical method” of negotiating a trade agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0497"/>
                        <p>I would add that the Minister had had a conversation in the morning with
                            Dr. Alberto Guerrero Martínez who is proceeding to the United States in
                            connection with the fishing concession in the Galapagos Islands and also
                            to attempt to interest an American company in the Naranjilla fruit (see
                            my despatch No. 671 of January 19, 1937). The Minister was most
                            enthusiastic about the prospects of this potential industry. I explained
                            to him our general practice to limit concessions to products which a
                            country supplies a principal or important proportion of the total
                            imports of such products into the United States. While the Minister
                            recognized the reasons for this practice, I gathered the impression that
                            Ecuador considers essential a concession on naranjilla fruit juice. I
                            would reiterate the opinion expressed in the last paragraph of my
                            despatch No. 671 of January 19, 1937, to the effect that a concession on
                            this article will facilitate considerably obtaining concessions from
                            Ecuador on articles in which we may be interested. In this connection I
                            venture to refer to the first paragraph on page three of my despatch No.
                            633 of December 15, 1936, in which I inquired whether it is feasible to
                            grant reductions on naranjilla juice without making the concession
                            applicable to all other juices. If such a procedure is possible it would
                            facilitate negotiations appreciably without affecting our bargaining
                            power on fruit juices in negotiations with other countries.</p>

                            December 15, 1936. It would seem that the internal revenue tax on this
                            product has already been reduced by 50%, from US$3.00 to US$1.50 per M
                            feet, under the Trade Agreement with Canada, in view of which no further
                            concession can be made except to bind the US$1.50 rate.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the concession desired on lentils, reference is made to
                            the first paragraph on page four of my despatch No. 632 of December 14,
                                1936,<note n="34" xml:id="d496fn34"><ref target="frus1936v05#pg_511"
                                        ><hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 511</ref>.</note> in which
                            I reported my observation made to the Director of the Commercial Section
                            of the Foreign Office that the export of <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489"
                                facs="0499"/>Ecuadorean lentils to the United States is practically
                            in the same class as is naranjilla juice, and that Dr. Banda recognized
                            at that time that a concession on this product would accrue principally
                            to Chilean lentils.</p>
                        <p>With regard to naranjilla and its juice, I venture to invite the
                            Department’s attention to my comments made in my despatch No. 680 of
                            January 30, 1937, and previous despatches, concerning the seeming
                            desirability, if not necessity, of making a concession to Ecuador on
                            this product. It occurs to me that if any concession made on naranjilla
                            juice must be extended to all fruit juices, the Department might desire
                            to give consideration to a contingent concession which would become
                            effective within a specified period after the conclusion of the
                            agreement, or when the exports of this product have reached a certain
                            quantity. I would reiterate my opinion that a concession on naranjilla
                            juice should facilitate appreciably the obtaining of concessions from
                            Ecuador in which we may be interested.</p>
                        <p>As concerns natural carbonic gas, I have the honor to refer to the second
                            paragraph of page four of my despatch No. 632 of December 14, 1936, in
                            which I reported my conversation with Dr. Banda on this subject. In this
                            connection Ecuador apparently seeks the abrogation of the prohibition of
                            the purchase of foreign products by American Government agencies.</p>
                        <p>The matter of a concession on Ecuadorean mineral waters is analogous to
                            that desired on naranjilla juice. These waters are undoubtedly of high
                            quality and, with a proper introduction into the American market, might
                            attain a large distribution in the United States. For the moment,
                            however, they are definitely only a potential export. Moreover, since
                            the containers must be imported inasmuch as there is no bottle factory
                            in Ecuador, it is not thought that these mineral waters could compete
                            with those supplied by other countries to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The inclusion of a request for a reduction of 50% in the existing duties
                            on manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco is the only addition to the
                            list previously prepared by the Ecuadorean Foreign Office (see
                            enclosures Nos. 1 and 2 of my despatch No. 633 of December 15, 1936).
                            This again is only a potential export. It is thought that upon pointing
                            out that the granting of such a concession to Ecuador, since it must
                            necessarily be extended to the principal supplying countries, Greece,
                            Turkey and Italy, would not improve the competitive position of
                            Ecuadorean tobacco in the American market, may be sufficient to convince
                            it that it would gain nothing by insisting on this concession.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your strictly confidential
                            despatch No. 660 of January 8, 1937, reporting a conversation which you
                            had with Dr. Francisco Banda, Chief of the Commercial and Consular
                            Section of the Ecuadoran Foreign Office, on the subject of the
                            contemplated trade agreement between this Government and Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>As you suggested to Dr. Banda, this Government could not consider his
                            proposal that no publicity be given to the tariff concessions which
                            Ecuador may grant this Government in the agreement.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Doctor Banda’s remarks concerning Ecuador’s desire not to
                            extend to other nations the concessions which it may make us in the
                            agreement, the Department regards this as a matter which the Ecuadoran
                            Government itself must decide. If the subject is brought up again, I
                            believe it would be entirely proper for you orally to review this
                            Government’s practice of generalizing concessions made in trade
                            agreements. This practice is in accord with the most-favored-nation
                            policy which this Government espouses and to which it adheres in its
                            commercial relations with other countries of the world. It is my
                            understanding that Ecuador seconded the efforts which this Government
                            made in favor of the principle of equality of treatment at the Pan
                            American Conference held in Montevideo in 1933<note n="35"

                                Printing Office, 1937), p. 240.</note> It is therefore assumed that
                            in general Ecuador likewise is convinced of the advantages of such a
                            policy. From an immediate and narrow point of view it would sometimes
                            seem to be desirable from the point of view of our trade if concessions
                            made to the United States were withheld from certain other countries,
                            thus giving American products a preferential tariff position. It is the
                            considered opinion of this Government, however, that such apparent
                            advantages are both transitory and illusory, since they cannot
                            compensate for the great damage to our trade as a whole which would
                            result from the abandonment on a larger scale of equality of
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>In the light of these circumstances this Government cannot help but hope
                            that Ecuador will see fit to follow an analogous procedure, <pb n="491"
                                xml:id="pg_491" facs="0501"/>even though, as stated before, this is
                            naturally a matter which Ecuador must decide for itself.</p>

                        <p>Consideration will also be given to the granting to Ecuador in its own
                            right of the reduction in the excise tax on imports of balsa wood not in
                            log form to $1.50 per thousand feet provided for at present in the
                            Canadian trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>Please bring this list to the attention of the Ecuadoran Government and
                            endeavor to obtain its acquiescence to the publication of it as a list
                            to which consideration of possible concessions by the United States to
                            Ecuador will be confined, emphasizing again the penultimate sentence of
                            the Department’s telegram No. 5. Cable results promptly in order that we
                            may, in the absence of objections, proceed with the publication of this
                            list as described in telegram No. 5.</p>
                        <p>Please request the Ecuadoran Government to withhold publicity on this
                            subject until date on which it is agreed that formal public announcement
                            and publication of the list will be made here.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for not including in the above list the other commodities in
                            which Ecuador expressed an interest in obtaining concessions are as
                            follows: In the case of rubber and its refuse, mangrove bark, lentils,
                            mineral waters, and manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco Ecuador is
                            an unimportant or negligible supplier. (With the possible exception of
                            pulverized bananas concerning which our information is not complete, the
                            only items included in the list in the first paragraph above of which
                            Ecuador is not, at least potentially, a principal or an important
                            supplier are items on which concessions have already been granted to
                            other countries.) With respect to wool rugs it has not been found
                            feasible to make a new tariff classification which would result in the
                            chief benefits of a possible concession on this product going to
                            Ecuador. As to carbonic gas no concession can be given for the reason
                            given in the last sentence of your despatch No. 632 of December 14,
                                1936.<note n="38" xml:id="d499fn38"><ref target="frus1936v05#pg_511"

                            supplier, is cinchona bark, which has been included in the above

                                >12</hi>], 7 p.m. The Foreign Office acquiesced in the proposed list

                            is very concerned over the omission of mangrove bark, rubber, and hides,

                            relinquishment of a privilege now enjoyed. I have emphasized the reasons
                            which make it impossible to accord binding on these products. I have
                            also set forth our policy seeking the liberalization of trade which
                            would make unlikely their removal from the free list. Nevertheless, in
                            order to refute anticipated local criticism the Foreign Office would be
                            pleased to have assurance that the failure to bind these products for
                            Ecuador implies no intention to remove them from the free list.</p>

                        <p>11. Your telegram No. 14, March 17, 6 p.m. The list in question will be
                            published soon as part of the formal public announcement of opening of

                            the near future as the products in respect of which the United States
                            will consider the granting of concessions to Ecuador in no way implies
                            that there is any intention on the part of the United States Government
                            to alter the tariff status of these three products. These products have
                            been omitted solely because Ecuador is a minor source of supply of the
                            imports of such products into the United States. If at some later date
                            any of these products now on the free list should be bound thereon under
                            trade agreements with countries which are the principal sources of
                            supply, Ecuador would, under the most-favored-nation clause, enjoy the
                            benefit of such assurances of continued free entry.</p>

                        <p>19. With the termination of the public hearings and expiration of the
                            period for submission of briefs in connection with the proposed trade
                            agreement with Ecuador, the Department is now hopeful that it can supply
                            you in the near future with a list of the concessions which this
                            Government would like to obtain in Schedule I together with drafts in
                            English and Spanish of the general provisions which it would like to
                            have inserted in the agreement. It would be helpful if you would report

                            states that it is prepared to negotiate promptly and favorably. If I can

                            I believe I can obtain prompt and favorable termination. After that time

                        <p>34. Department’s telegram No. 23, July 17, 2 p.m. The changes in the
                            tariff rates are for revenue purposes, increasing luxury items and
                            decreasing duties on certain necessities. An examination reveals <pb
                                n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0506"/>that the changes affect only a
                            part of the items in Schedule I and are slight as concerns those items.
                            However, the Foreign Office insists that in according consideration to
                            our requests for reductions it will be obliged to do so on the basis of
                            the new rates. On this basis and because of the reductions now made and
                            Ecuadoran commitment it would be possible to obtain rates of 7½ and 25
                            centavos on flour and lard respectively and lower rate bindings on tires
                            and inner tubes. Naturally on the items increased it will not be
                            feasible to obtain the full reductions contemplated.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend that we not seek lower rates than 10 and 30 centavos on
                            flour and lard and attempt to trade this difference for increased
                            reductions on other items. I anticipate that Ecuador is not prepared to
                            grant reductions as large as requested on the other items. Please answer
                            by telegraph.</p>

                        <p>42. A decree dated yesterday repeals impounding of the proceeds of

                            deposits for imports at the old official rate of exchange; requires the
                            payment in dollars of the customs charges on shipments arriving from the
                            United States after 10 days, rate of conversion of the charges to be
                            fixed by the Minister of Finance but the dollars to be obtained in the
                            free market; and authorizes unrestricted importation of specified
                            articles, other articles to be permitted under license.</p>

                            requests. In view of these circumstances and the confused situation
                            which may result after the meeting of the Constitutional Assembly on
                            August 10 it is my opinion that if negotiations could be initiated
                            before the end of this week the outlook for a prompt and favorable
                            termination would be more propitious. Accordingly I am hopeful that the
                            Department may be able to authorize me to present immediately Schedule I
                            with such changes and additions as it may deem necessary. Please answer
                            by telegraph.</p>

                            reporting the substance of my conversation with Doctor Francisco Banda
                            in the matter of the proposed trade agreement, I have the honor to state
                            that I have had three conversations with the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs on the subject. While these conversations have revealed that the
                            Foreign Minister will do everything in his power to reconcile the
                            conflicting points of view, I seriously doubt that he will be able to
                            convince his Government that acquiescence in an appreciable number of
                            the concessions sought is compatible with existing political and
                            economic conditions. I shall give the substance of these conversations
                            as well as my conclusions.</p>
                        <p>In my first interview with the Foreign Minister on August 16th, I stated
                            that in my conversation with Doctor Banda I had gathered that Ecuador is
                            prepared to grant in a very limited manner only a few of the concessions
                            and assurances which we seek. In fact, Doctor Banda had stated
                            categorically that local economic conditions did not permit the
                            according of favorable consideration on our requests in excess of those
                            already indicated (See page 6 of my despatch No. 868 of August 13,
                            1937). I told the Minister that I was unable to reconcile this attitude
                            with his very broad statement on foreign commercial policy made in
                            response to the statement of Secretary Hull of July 16th.<note n="43"

                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that his country is confronted with two
                            serious problems which have not yet been solved, namely, a deficit in
                            its international balance of payments and a deficit in the national
                            budget. He added that their solution is complicated by the recent
                            depreciation in the local currency, as well as by the fact that the
                            Government has always depended upon its customs receipts as the chief
                            source of budgetary revenue and that the people have become accustomed
                            to that practice. He emphasized that the customs policy of Ecuador is
                            primarily for revenue and that the present difficult fiscal situation
                            places his Government in a position where it cannot renounce any of this
                            very secure source of revenue. In fact, it finds itself where it must
                            seek to augment budgetary receipts and that this was the reason for the
                            recent increase in customs duties as well as in internal taxes. He
                            explained that while he and the President are of <pb n="499"
                                xml:id="pg_499" facs="0509"/>the opinion that steps must be taken to
                            reduce customs charges, they cannot ignore the fact that while the total
                            budgetary revenues of the country must be increased, the attitude of the
                            people is one of resistance to direct taxation. In view of these
                            circumstances he expressed the hope that the American Government would
                            understand why Ecuador cannot at this time accord to our requests the
                            favorable consideration which it should like to do.</p>
                        <p>I consider it appropriate at this point to add parenthetically that the
                            Foreign Minister made no mention of the purchases of armaments and of
                            the expenditures for military training and preparedness which, in my
                            opinion, are primarily responsible for the two acute problems now
                            confronting the country. Neither did he refer to the loans obtained from
                            Italy for some of these purchases (see my despatch No. 872 of August 19,
                                1937<note n="44" xml:id="d513fn44">Not printed.</note>) which have
                            not yet been taken up in the Budget. It is indisputable that these
                            purchases aggravated an already difficult national and international
                            financial situation, and it is thought that the additional budgetary
                            revenues now required are principally to cover those expenditures.
                            Furthermore, I am inclined to believe that this situation was an
                            important factor in the decision of the Government to cancel the highway
                            contract of the Foundation Company of New York (see my despatch No. 875
                            of August 19, 1937<note n="44" xml:id="d513fn50">Not printed.</note>),
                            and it will not be a cause for great surprise if a substantial
                            proportion of the taxes earmarked and now accumulating for the
                            construction of highways is diverted from that purpose and used to cover
                            the budgetary deficit caused by military expenditures. Verily, the state
                            of fiscal finances is both delicate and difficult, and the renouncement
                            of any existing revenues would probably serve to aggravate rather than
                            to remedy the situation.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to the Minister that several of our requests involve only
                            the binding of the present rates of existing duty on certain items, but
                            that Doctor Banda had stated that favorable consideration could not be
                            accorded these requests inasmuch as the conclusion had been reached from
                            experience in the operation of the Chilean Agreement that such a
                            commitment is not advantageous. The Minister confirmed this statement
                            and added that the Commercial Treaty with Chile is highly inexpedient
                            because of the clause binding the rates of duties on various articles.
                            He said that considerable study had been given this particular phase of
                            the treaty and that a decision had been taken to denounce it and that it
                            will expire in December of this year.</p>
                        <p>I then explained that we are seeking, in so far as may be compatible with
                            the situation existing in each country, to remove <pb n="500"
                                xml:id="pg_500" facs="0510"/>unnatural barriers to trade, to reduce
                            especially high duties and to stabilize normal duties. I added that the
                            reason advanced by Doctor Banda for the inability of his Government to
                            accord favorable consideration to binding normal duties was the recent
                            depreciation of the local currency and the necessity of having a free
                            hand to adjust the duties to the new exchange levels. I recognized that
                            this explanation seemed to cover specific duties but that I failed to
                            see the application as concerns ad valorem duties inasmuch as these
                            latter are effectively a percentage of the gold value of imported
                            merchandise. Under the circumstances, the binding of ad valorem duties
                            could in no way affect unfavorably the Government’s revenues in local
                            currency except to increase the amount thereof in proportion to any
                            depreciation which may occur. The Minister admitted this argument and
                            stated that he would discuss the point with the Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>With regard to specific duties I recognized that the Government of
                            Ecuador may desire to adopt a policy which would assure it of definite
                            revenues in foreign as well as local currency. In view thereof I
                            intimated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs might desire to make
                            some proposal for the stabilization of these rates which he agreed to
                            do.</p>
                        <p>I then referred to the statement of Doctor Banda with respect to the
                            reductions on hog lard and wheat flour in which he had indicated that
                            the Minister of Finance would not consent to a reduction greater than
                            50% of the old tariff rates. I explained that upon learning of the
                            tariff changes of July 5, 1937, I had inquired of Doctor Banda what
                            effect these would have on our requests for concessions, and that he had
                            stated that we must accept the new tariff as the basis for negotiation.
                            I added that I had remarked at the time to Doctor Banda that the
                            application of this principle would entitle us to a reduction of 50% of
                            the new reduced rates on wheat flour and hog lard which he had admitted.
                            The Foreign Minister immediately said that he considered this position
                            unreasonable and that it is the existing rates which must be taken into
                            consideration. He assured me that he would discuss this point with the
                            Minister of Finance and endeavor to have him accept the principle of 50%
                            of the present tariff rates.</p>
                        <p>In my second interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on August
                            24th, he read a memorandum prepared by Doctor Banda on the points raised
                            by me in our previous interview which simply restated the observations
                            reported in my despatch No. 868 of August 13, 1937. The only new point
                            brought forth was with regard to the general provisions, the memorandum
                            indicating the necessity of the inclusion of a provision similar to
                            Article X in the Treaty of <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0511"

                            Minister that I did not consider it feasible to include such a provision
                            in the proposed agreement for the reason that it must be interpreted as
                            a qualification and restriction of the broad scope of the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation clause upon which it had previously been agreed to
                            predicate the negotiation of the agreement. Accordingly, I agreed to
                            prepare a memorandum on this point which I would deliver to him on the
                            following day.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday I had a further conversation with the Foreign Minister and I
                            presented to him the memorandum on the unconditional most-favored-nation
                            clause, a copy of which I enclose herewith.<note n="46"
                                xml:id="d513fn46">Not printed.</note> The reaction of the Minister
                            was surprising to me notwithstanding it reflected the peculiar
                            interpretation which Ecuador has always endeavored to give to the
                            unconditional most-favored-nation clause. In effect, he indicated that
                            the clause in question is applicable only in cases where reciprocal
                            advantages might be received by Ecuador, such as in its trade relations
                            with France, Germany and the United States, but that advantages could
                            not be extended to other countries whose trade balances might be
                            unfavorable to Ecuador. I emphasized that the inclusion of the proposed
                            provision concerning the balance of trade must be construed as a
                            restriction of the unconditional clause, thus converting it into the
                            conditional rather than the unconditional most-favored-nation principle.
                            I believe that I was successful in making the Minister see that should
                            such a clause be included in the proposed trade agreement and should our
                            commerce at any time show a visible balance of trade unfavorable to
                            Ecuador, it would be incumbent upon his Government to withhold from the
                            United States the advantages of the Preferential Tariff. I added that he
                            must realize that in such an event we would be obliged to view such
                            action as a discrimination since we could not ignore the fact that there
                            was being accorded to a third country a treatment more favorable than
                            that granted to the United States. The Minister agreed to discuss this
                            situation further with the President and the Finance Minister.</p>
                        <p>During the discussion of this particular point the Minister remarked that
                            according to preliminary customs statistics for the first part of the
                            present year, the visible balance of American-Ecuadorean trade appeared
                            unfavorable to the latter country. I took advantage of this statement to
                            point out that under the circumstances the inclusion <pb n="502"
                                xml:id="pg_502" facs="0512"/>of the proposed clause would no longer
                            be a simple acquiescence upon our part to a principle of Ecuadorean
                            commercial policy with no possible adverse consequences, but would
                            become an immediate threat to our trade and an effective discrimination
                            in the treatment thereof upon importation into Ecuador. The Minister
                            then outlined briefly the objective sought by Ecuador in the application
                            of the Preferential Tariff and the attempt thereby to balance its trade
                            with foreign countries. In other words, his statement simply confirmed
                            that Ecuador adheres to the principle of the bilateral balancing of
                            foreign trade. He referred in particular to Ecuadorean-German trade
                            relations and called my attention to the increased purchases by the
                            latter country. This gave me the opportunity to observe that Ecuadorean
                            foreign commercial policy, in my opinion, would seem to be contributing
                            effectively to the dislocation of foreign trade from its natural
                            channels. I felt it incumbent upon me to point out informally that while
                            the bilateral balancing of trade may have some useful results in a
                            country having surplus exports which it is unable to dispose of in the
                            world markets, this situation does not appear to exist in Ecuador
                            inasmuch as, according to my information, Ecuador in latter years has
                            disposed without difficulty of its entire export production. Therefore,
                            the situation created by this dislocation will be that American
                            importers will be unable to purchase in this country the products which
                            they ordinarily require, not because of any indisposition upon their
                            part but simply because of the inexistence of such products. I remarked
                            that under these circumstances it would seem to me that Ecuador would
                            achieve more if its policy were directed to augmenting the production of
                            exportable products rather than to deliberately diverting them from the
                            natural channels of its trade. This point of view would not seem to have
                            been previously brought to the attention of the Minister. He was
                            apparently much impressed and agreed to discuss these views with his
                            colleague the Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>I felt that in my previous conversations the authorities had not
                            comprehended fully the concessions and assurances we are seeking with
                            respect to the items included in Schedule I. In fact, the Foreign
                            Minister on August 24th indicated his impression that we desired these
                            items included in the Preferential Tariff which would be in accord with
                            the present foreign commercial policy of Ecuador. While I felt that I
                            had made it clear that we desire the rates in Schedule I established as
                            net rates independent of the existence of any other factor, I decided
                            that it was indispensable to furnish him a memorandum in this respect, a
                            copy of which I enclose herewith for the information of the
                                Department.<note n="48" xml:id="d513fn48">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0513"/>
                        <p>After reading over the memorandum carefully the Minister appeared to
                            understand precisely what we seek. Nevertheless, he remarked that it was
                            his understanding that we are not interested in the Preferential Tariff
                            and that we would be willing to surrender the advantages thereof. I
                            immediately corrected this impression to the effect that while we have
                            little interest in the Preferential Tariff as a whole, there are
                            possibly several items contained therein, in addition to those already
                            listed in Schedule I, which may be of interest to our export trade. I
                            added, however, that aside from this fact I was unable to see how we
                            could relinquish whatever advantages might accrue to us through the
                            enjoyment of that Tariff, or the right to enjoy that Tariff regardless
                            of whether or not the items listed therein are of interest to us,
                            because of our adherence to the principle of the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment.</p>
                        <p>Our position with respect to the Preferential Tariff and our rights under
                            the unconditional most-favored-nation clause would appear to be so clear
                            that no further argument or discussion would seem necessary.
                            Nevertheless, I am obliged to admit that I find a definite reluctance
                            upon the part of the Ecuadorean authorities to admit this position. I
                            can only explain this situation as being due to the conflict in the two
                            commercial policies, and that Ecuador reserves the granting of the
                            Preferential Tariff and the inclusion of new items therein as a
                            bargaining power to obtain advantages from other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that in a brief conversation
                            with the President he had touched upon the subject of the proposed trade
                            agreement. He added that the President had indicated to him that he must
                            be extremely reluctant to grant any major reductions in customs rates
                            for the reason that Ecuador cannot now afford to relinquish an
                            appreciable part of its customs revenue—in fact, it should seek an
                            increase in these revenues in order to cover the deficit in its
                            Budget.</p>
                        <p>Another point emphasized by the Minister for Foreign Affairs concerns the
                            extension to third countries of the advantages which might be conceded
                            to the United States. During the course of my three conversations he
                            repeatedly referred to that point and indicated the indisposition to
                            grant us concessions because of the necessity immediately to extend them
                            to Germany, Italy, Chile and France. I again outlined to him our general
                            policy under the most-favored-nation clause to generalize all advantages
                            that we grant. I added that while we hoped that Ecuador might see its
                            way clear to follow this same practice, it is a matter which must, of
                            course be decided by Ecuador. While the Minister understood the point
                            made I feel that it will be extremely difficult to obtain concessions on
                            items of which the countries mentioned are important suppliers. One
                            commodity in <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0514"/>particular is
                            tariff item No. 372–c, Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Preparations.
                            According to the statistics compiled by the Department for the year 1935
                            Germany supplied 34%, France 24% and the United States 32%. The Minister
                            indicated that Germany’s participation in 1936 and particularly during
                            the current year had increased appreciably. Therefore, he desires to
                            retain the present rate of duty for subsequent negotiations with
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>Before making any recommendation as to procedure, it would seem desirable
                            to review briefly the different factors in the present situation:</p>
                        <p>1. Ecuador is faced with two serious problems, first, a deficit in its
                            international balance of payments and second, a deficit in its Budget.
                            The first problem may be solved by an increase in the world price of its
                            exports, by an increase in production, or possibly by a restriction in
                            imports. The possibility of an appreciable and immediate increase in
                            world prices would seem to be purely conjecture for the moment. An
                            effort is being made to increase production, but this is subject to
                            climatic conditions and other incontrolable factors. In the absence of
                            the first two solutions Ecuador has apparently decided upon the
                            restriction of imports (see my despatch No. 856 of August 2, 1937<note
                                n="49" xml:id="d513fn49">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>The deficit in the Budget is possibly a more urgent and serious problem
                            since the depreciation of the currency aggravates the situation by
                            increasing the local currency value of the already excessive purchases
                            made abroad. A measure has been taken to stabilize this situation by the
                            conversion of customs charges into United States currency at the rate of
                            twelve sucres to the dollar and by the payment thereof in United States
                            currency. This measure results in an increase of approximately 13% in
                            the local currency revenue, but at the same time it causes a loss of
                            approximately the same percentage in the foreign currency revenue of the
                            Government. This latter is important in view of the payments which the
                            Government must make abroad for armaments purchased. These
                            circumstances, and particularly that the Budget does not cover all
                            armament purchases made or contracted abroad, create a situation where
                            the Government cannot afford to abandon its present revenues.</p>
                        <p>2. The conflict between American and Ecuadorean foreign commercial policy
                            is now apparent. Ecuador, in attempting to enforce the theory of
                            bilateral balancing of trade, would insist upon the inclusion of a
                            provision stipulating that the visible balance of trade must be
                            favorable to it, upon the failure of which we should be denied the
                            advantages of the Preferential Tariff. While the latter may interest
                            American export trade only slightly, it is thought that the provision
                            would be a specific restriction and qualification of the <pb n="505"
                                xml:id="pg_505" facs="0515"/>unconditional most-favored-nation
                            clause and, therefore, unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>3. Ecuador insists that it is unable to bind or reduce rates of duty
                            because of the depreciation of the local currency. While this reason is
                            apparently reasonable, I fear that the underlying cause is the necessity
                            for budgetary revenue outlined in the second paragraph of No. 1 above. I
                            consider that it might be possible to convince the authorities of the
                            feasibility of binding the present ad valorem import duties. Also, it
                            may be possible to work out an arrangement for the stabilization of
                            specific duties by their conversion at a specified rate into United
                            States currency and their payment in that money. For example, it might
                            be possible to take advantage of the system which has been recently
                            established by the Government providing for the conversion of customs
                            charges into United States currency at the rate of twelve sucres to the
                            dollar and the payment thereof in dollars. It will be necessary, of
                            course, to include some provision to the effect that this system must
                            obtain for all import duties.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendations.</hi></p>
                        <p>The international financial and the fiscal situations, and the consequent
                            attitude of the Ecuadorean Government, would seem to make the present
                            moment inauspicious for the negotiation of the proposed trade agreement.
                            However, I feel that we should anticipate the arising of a difficult
                            situation as a result of the large purchases by Germany which will
                            undoubtedly reduce Ecuadorean exports to the United States, possibly to
                            a point where the visible balance of trade may be unfavorable to this
                            country. In view of this circumstance I would recommend that we proceed
                            with the negotiations in an attempt to have the Ecuadorean Government
                            withdraw from its present position in the matter of the Preferential
                            Tariff and the penalty for the failure to show a balance of trade
                            favorable to this country. It might be desirable to include some
                            provision on this point in the Agreement in view of the question having
                            again arisen when it was apparently settled when our <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi> was negotiated. I feel that I may be able to
                            obtain bindings on ad valorem duties and possibly on specific duties if
                            an arrangement for their stabilization can be worked out. I also believe
                            that it may be possible to obtain the 50% reduction on the existing
                            duties on hog lard and wheat flour. However, on this point I must
                            reiterate that it would be unwise to accept this additional advantage
                            and I strongly recommend that I be authorized to forego the extra
                            reduction in the duties on these two products. I am certain that such an
                            authorization would be welcomed by the Ecuadorean Government and would
                            permit me to obtain concessions or assurances on other items which would
                            not be so open to local criticism.</p>

                        <p>40. In several of your recent despatches reporting conversations on the
                            trade agreement you have indicated that Ecuador will not consent to bind
                            any tariff rates unless they are specified in dollars. Presumably this
                            would also apply to items on which reductions are requested. The trade
                            agreements program envisages the reduction of tariff and other barriers
                            to international trade and the stabilization of the conditions under
                            which such trade is carried on. Since to specify bound or reduced rates
                            in dollars would be to permit them to fluctuate in sucres, which would
                            not appear to furnish the stability sought, the Department is reluctant
                            to accede to the proposal. If this proposal is made by the Minister of
                            Finance because of revenue considerations, it may be pointed out that
                            barring a substantial devaluation of the sucre, the expenditures of the
                            Government of Ecuador (which are principally in local currency) will not
                            increase or decrease with each change in the exchange value of the
                            sucre. In this connection it would be helpful to have your opinion as to
                            the probability of a further decline in the exchange value of the
                            sucre.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to discuss this matter again with the appropriate
                            Ecuadoran officials along the lines indicated above with a view to
                            ascertaining how insistent they are on the collection of duties on <pb
                                n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0517"/>schedule articles in terms of
                            the dollar and the reasons therefor. You should find out their position
                            in this regard with respect to reductions and bindings of both specific
                            and ad valorem rates in the schedule.</p>
                        <p>Report fully by telegraph the outcome of your conversations together with
                            your comments thereon. In this connection indicate also what prospect
                            you believe there is for a fairly speedy and successful termination of
                            the negotiations. With a heavy program scheduled for the coming months
                            the Department is anxious to have this agreement out of the way as soon
                            as possible.</p>

                        <p>54. Referring to Department’s telegram number 40, September 20, 2 p.m.,
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs insists upon the inclusion of the
                            clause which would make the concession of the preferential tariff
                            conditional upon our trade showing a balance favorable to Ecuador. I
                            again pointed out that this position would seem unacceptable since it
                            could be construed only as a qualification of the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation principle whereupon the Foreign Minister admitted
                            that the commercial policy of his Government is based on the conditional
                            principle. I recalled that the Ecuadorian Government adhered to the
                            principle of equality of treatment in the Montevideo and the Buenos
                            Aires Conferences and, moreover, that it agreed formally that the
                            proposed agreement would be predicated on the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation principle. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied
                            that the whole Ecuadorian commercial treaty structure is based upon the
                            conditional trade clause and that an exception in favor of the United
                            States cannot be made. He added that his Government is determined upon
                            this policy and that if necessary it will publicly renounce its
                            adherence to the unconditional principle.</p>
                        <p>Preliminary statistics indicate that the diversion of Ecuadorian exports
                            has been so great that the trade balance with the United States this
                            year may be passive. The reluctance to include the value of cyanide
                            precipitates notwithstanding the pertinent law refers to the visible
                            balance of trade and not of payments, may make that balance even more
                            passive. Should this situation arise we would be faced with the threat
                            of classification in the second or third categories mentioned in my
                            despatch number 503, August 26, 1936,<note n="50" xml:id="d516fn50">Not
                                printed.</note> with the consequent penalties and
                            discriminations.</p>
                        <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs offered to make bindings of ad valorem
                            and specific duties in dollar equivalents and a few additional
                            reductions. While he believed the schedule rates could be maintained he
                            said that his Government must reserve the right, so that it could have a
                            free hand, to increase the whole tariff proportionately if found
                            necessary for revenue purposes.</p>
                        <p>The commitments of the Government in foreign currency demand
                            stabilization of customs charges in dollar equivalents. I am informed
                            that even these revenues are insufficient and that additional amounts
                            must be purchased in the open market. The outlook for next year is
                            obscure and failing a halt in armament purchases financial conditions
                            may be expected to become increasingly critical.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing I am of the opinion that the negotiations should
                            be suspended until a more propitious moment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 909 of
                            September 25, 1937,<note n="51" xml:id="d518fn51">Not printed.</note>
                            reporting my conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the
                            matter of the proposed trade agreement, I have the honor to transmit
                            herewith a Memorandum with English translation <pb n="509"
                                xml:id="pg_509" facs="0519"/>received this morning which sets forth
                            the concessions which Ecuador is prepared to make.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the percentage reductions, those in tariff items Nos.
                            684–a, –b, –c, –d and –e, the percentage reductions are slightly higher
                            than those indicated since for example in No. 684–a the duty would
                            actually be reduced from 45% to 35% (see page 3 of my despatch under
                            reference).</p>
                        <p>With regard to the last paragraph of the Memorandum I deemed it desirable
                            that the Department have the exact text of the reasons for Ecuador’s
                            insistence upon the inclusion of the trade balance clause, in view of
                            which I incorporated it in my telegram No. 55 of September 27, 1 p.m.,
                            1937. What the Foreign Office desires to express is that the visible
                            balance of trade must show an active balance for Ecuador in order to
                            cover the appreciable invisible items of ocean freight, insurance,
                            capital remittances, and the appreciable proportion of the value of
                            petroleum and cyanide precipitates shipments which appear in export
                            statistics but which do not return to the country. In order to achieve
                            that favorable visible balance Ecuador has committed itself to the
                            exigency that all countries must show a passive balance in their trade
                            with Ecuador in order to obtain and continue to enjoy the maximum
                            concessions and benefits granted under the Preferential Tariff and other
                            trade arrangements.</p>

                        <p>42. The Department has learned with regret of the developments reported
                            in your telegram No. 54, September 25, 11 a.m. Before considering the
                            undesirable step of suspending negotiations, the Department believes the
                            situation should be thoroughly and frankly discussed with the Ecuadoran
                            Government. Accordingly, I am arranging to call in the Ecuadoran
                            Ambassador with whom I shall go over the facts in the hope that he may
                            use his influence to have the Foreign Minister recede sufficiently from
                            the position he has taken to allow negotiations to continue.</p>
                        <p>I suggest, if you perceive no objection, that you also see the Foreign
                            Minister again, pointing out, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, that <list>

                                <item>At Ecuador’s behest and on the strength of that country’s

                                    most-favored-nation principle, this Government has devoted
                                    considerable time and personnel in an effort to work out an
                                    agreement with Ecuador at a time when other countries have been
                                    pressing for trade agreements.</item>

                                <item>This Government had been encouraged to believe both by
                                    Ecuador’s interest in having a trade agreement with the United
                                    States and the record of its participation in the conferences at
                                    Montevideo and Buenos Aires where liberal trade policies were
                                    endorsed by the American Republics that Ecuador was prepared to
                                    translate them into reality and thus assist in the difficult but
                                    urgently needed task of freeing world trade of the mass of
                                    artificial barriers which are choking its growth and thus
                                    slowing down economic recovery and engendering international ill
                                    feeling. The effective cooperation of the Republics of America
                                    toward these goals has never been more needed than at this
                                    present disturbed moment in world relations.</item>

                                <item>This Government believes that were Ecuador to join with the
                                    increasing number of countries which are actively participating
                                    in the movement to liberalize trade, such action would be of
                                    general benefit to international trade relations as well as of
                                    cumulative advantage to Ecuadoran economy. The Government of the
                                    United States hopes therefore to have Ecuador’s continuing
                                    cooperation in order that present negotiations may be brought to
                                    a successful conclusion in the near future.<note n="51a"

                        <p>57. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 42, October 6, 7 p.m. I again
                            discussed the matter exhaustively this morning with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs in an effort to persuade him to recede from the position
                            taken. He reiterated previous arguments and stated categorically that
                            his Government is not prepared to abandon the conditional trade balance
                            clause. While I have obtained his agreement to reconsider the whole
                            question in the light of the points made in the Department’s telegram
                            and of other practical considerations I am not hopeful that he will
                            recede sufficiently to allow the negotiations to continue.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Ecuador called this afternoon at my request, and I
                            handed him the memorandum<note n="52" xml:id="d521fn52">See footnote
                                51a, <ref target="#pg_511">p. 511</ref>.</note> which had been
                            prepared for him with regard to the trade agreement negotiations between
                            Ecuador and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador read the memorandum carefully in my presence and then
                            stated that he was entirely surprised and completely at a loss since he
                            had not received a single word from his Government regarding any change
                            of attitude on the part of the Government of Ecuador. He reminded me
                            that he received personal letters from the President of Ecuador at least
                            twice a week in addition to his official communications from his Foreign
                            Office and said that in none of these communications had any indication
                            been received of any change of attitude on the part of Ecuador. He asked
                            if I didn’t think that Mr. Gonzalez might have misapprehended
                            representations which had been made to him. I replied that Mr. Gonzalez’
                            statements seemed to be so full and so definite that I could hardly
                            apprehend that any misunderstanding had occurred. I told the Ambassador
                            that this whole situation gave us a great deal of disquiet and
                            disappointment.</p>
                        <p>I said there were two points which I would like for him particularly to
                            consider: First, that both Governments had obviously reached the
                            conclusion after much consideration that a trade agreement between <pb
                                n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0523"/>the two countries would be a
                            very positive advantage to the commercial interests of both nations;
                            second, that in view of Ecuador’s unreserved support of the resolutions
                            for a liberal trade policy on the part of the American republics
                            presented by the United States and adopted unanimously by all of the
                            American republics at Buenos Aires, it seemed inconceivable that Ecuador
                            should now insist upon taking a position which was completely at
                            variance with all of the principles inherent in those resolutions and
                            that in addition thereto, such an attitude on the part of Ecuador at a
                            time when the United States was doing everything within its power to
                            further those liberal trade principles in international relations which
                            it believed essential for world rehabilitation, would necessarily and
                            inevitably be regarded as a discouragement and as a set-back by all of
                            the many nations who are now working with us towards those ends.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he would at once transmit our memorandum by air mail
                            to his Foreign Minister and that he would likewise immediately transmit
                            an air mail letter to the President of Ecuador asking for full
                            information and urging his Government to consider favorably the point of
                            view expressed in the memorandum I had handed him. He told me that he
                            would advise me as soon as he received some response.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Department’s
                            telegram No. 42 of October 6th, 7 p.m., 1937, and in confirmation of my
                            telegram No. 57 of October 8th, 4 p.m., 1937, I have the honor to report
                            that I interviewed the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday morning
                            during which we discussed the situation which has arisen because of his
                            insistence upon the inclusion of the Ecuadorean trade balance clause in
                            the proposed trade agreement. I anticipated no success in persuading him
                            to recede sufficiently from the position taken in view of his previous
                            categorical statements on the subject and his assertion that the
                            President and the Minister of Finance share the same views.
                            Notwithstanding, I thought it desirable to go over the whole question
                            again in the hope that he might reconsider his position.</p>
                        <p>I told the Foreign Minister that my Government had learned with keen
                            regret of the incident which had developed in the negotiations, and that
                            it was not disposed to take the step of considering the suspension of
                            the negotiations pending a frank and thorough <pb n="514"
                                xml:id="pg_514" facs="0524"/>discussion of the conflict which had
                            developed. I then permitted him to read a memorandum in which I had
                            incorporated the three points made in the Department’s telegram under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>The Minister immediately replied that the situation has not changed and
                            that he must state categorically that his Government is not in a
                            position to abandon the conditional trade balance clause. He then
                            proceeded to cite arguments previously presented and he emphasized, in
                            particular, that the abandonment of this clause would imply the
                            abrogation of the several Commercial Treaties recently or about to be
                            concluded by Ecuador with foreign countries. He stated that the primary
                            purpose of the clause and the policy based thereon, is to stimulate
                            foreign markets for Ecuadorean products, and that the policy has had
                            signal success in support of which he referred to the increase in
                            exports to Germany, France and Japan. He also stated that the policy has
                            been a means of increasing the price of many Ecuadorean products,
                            especially vegetable ivory which is now being purchased in large
                            quantities by Japan. He said that in previous years the price had been
                            so low that Ecuadoreans were little disposed to collect the nut, but now
                            with the increased demand and the easy placing of this product in
                            foreign markets, the price has improved and there has been a consequent
                            increase in exportation. The Minister also stated that the abandonment
                            of the trade balance clause would involve a complete disregard of the
                            pertinent law. I ventured to point out that it is my understanding that
                            the clause is not the subject of a law but of an Executive Decree, in
                            view of which an amendment or change would seem to require action only
                            by the Executive Department.</p>
                        <p>At this point I called to his attention the statistics on export trade
                            for the first seven months of this year (see my despatch No. 916,
                            October 4, 1937<note n="53" xml:id="d522fn53">Not printed.</note>), and
                            explained that exports to Japan, France and Germany appear to have
                            increased about 21,000,000 sucres, but that this increase has been made
                            at the expense of exports to the United States inasmuch as a
                            corresponding decrease seems to have occurred in their value. Under
                            these circumstances the consequences of the policy seem to be a direct
                            dislocation of the exports from their natural channels. The Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs immediately replied that this dislocation of trade is
                            due to the policy but also to the fact that the price paid for the
                            articles is higher in those countries than in the American market which
                            accounts for their being diverted to those markets. I would add
                            parenthetically that I learned this morning that this question was
                            bitterly debated in Quito a few days ago at a bankers conference on the
                            internal credit situation. One banker pointed out forcibly that the
                            Central Bank of Ecuador now has in its <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515"
                                facs="0525"/>portfolio credits of 14,000,000 sucres of askimarks,
                            and he charged the Board of the Central Bank as being directly
                            responsible for the present stringent credit situation. He added that
                            the higher prices paid by Germany is a myth since they are entirely
                            dependent on the quotation of the askimark in sucres which he considers
                            excessively high. He further said that the present accumulation of
                            credits in Germany might be better described as the poor country of
                            Ecuador’s having made a loan to Germany in that amount.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then proceeded to state that Ecuador is a small country and
                            that it cannot afford to make any innovations in the restrictive systems
                            practiced by the larger countries. I immediately pointed out that we had
                            already concluded trade agreements on the unconditional principle with

                            the position of those countries appeared to be in a great number of
                            respects analogous to that of Ecuador. The Minister immediately changed
                            his tactics and replied that Ecuador could not afford to make any
                            sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then referred to financial conditions within the country and
                            stated that his Government could not afford to reduce substantially its
                            customs revenues. I stated that while my Government is seeking to
                            stabilize customs charges and to reduce excessive rates, it would be
                            disposed to view the situation sympathetically and not demand more than
                            Ecuador is in a position to grant.</p>
                        <p>I then asked the Foreign Minister whether he would be disposed to
                            reconsider his position in the light of the points made in the
                            Department’s telegram under reference. I added that it would seem
                            desirable in doing so to determine whether the consequence of a change
                            in the principles of Ecuadorean commercial policy would be as
                            detrimental economically to the country as he seemed to think. In this
                            connection I ventured to express the opinion that Ecuador’s adoption of
                            the unconditional most-favored-nation principle would be an important
                            contribution to the improvement of world trade which, according to my
                            knowledge of local economic conditions, could be made without any
                            sacrifice to national economy. I also reminded him that the Constituent
                            Assembly has designated a special committee to formulate a complete plan
                            for the financial and economic reorganization of the country and that he
                            might desire to obtain their views. The Chairman of this Committee has
                            broad views and I intend to discuss with him the principles and reasons
                            of our trade policy which <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0526"/>may
                            be helpful. The Foreign Minister agreed to reexamine the whole matter
                            and to consult again with the President of Ecuador and the Minister of
                            Finance. Inasmuch as today through the 12th are local holidays I do not
                            believe that a decision in the matter will be taken before the end of
                            next week at the earliest.</p>

                        <p>46. Referring to your telegram no. 57, October 8, 4 p.m. The Under
                            Secretary discussed on October 8 the trade agreement situation with the
                            Ecuadoran Ambassador in Washington who stated that he would communicate
                            at once with the Foreign Minister and the President urging them to
                            consider favorably this Government’s point of view in the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Department hopes that the Foreign Minister’s promise made to you to
                            reconsider the question combined with Ambassador Alfaro’s
                            recommendations will result in the situation taking a more favorable
                            turn. You are, of course, correct in your belief that this Government
                            could not consider any such limitation of the most-favored-nation
                            principle as the Ecuadoran Government has proposed.</p>

                        <p>60. Referring to my telegram No. 57, October 8, 4 p.m. I have just
                            received a long memorandum from the Minister for Foreign Affairs stating
                            that the application of the Montevideo and Buenos Aires declarations on
                            commercial policy was contingent upon the local economic situations
                            permitting the same; that the declarations have not been ratified by the
                            Government of Ecuador precisely because the economic situation obliged
                            the adoption of a policy which would permit the payment of the
                            appreciable invisible imports, that the Government of Ecuador is
                            determined to make any sacrifice to encourage and strengthen commercial
                            relations with the United States but that no exception can be made with
                            regard to the trade balance clause since this would involve a complete
                            change of policy; that the conclusion last year of the visa waiver
                            agreement is proof of this special <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517"
                                facs="0527"/>deference to the United States since it is more
                            favorable to the United States because of the greater number [of]
                            Americans travelling; that Ecuador practices most-favored-nation
                            treatment with all countries whose balance of trade is favorable to it;
                            that the preferential treatment granted by the United States to Cuba
                            shows that exception must be made at times to the unconditional
                            principle; that the unconditional principle is not applied by many
                            American countries including Cuba which maintains three tariffs applying
                            the maximum to Ecuador to which no objection has been made because it is
                            felt that the policy is in conformity with Cuba’s economic interests;
                            that in view of the foregoing the Government of Ecuador is confident
                            that the United States will consider sympathetically the special
                            conditions which obliged Ecuador to adopt its commercial policy and will
                            take into account that the trade balance between the two countries will
                            continue to be favorable to Ecuador and therefore will accept the
                            principle which is of capital importance for the economy of the country.
                            No reference is made to the formal commitment of last December.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 929 of
                            October 21, 1937,<note n="57" xml:id="d525fn57">Not printed.</note> and
                            previous correspondence, regarding the insistence of the Ecuadorean
                            Government upon the trade balance clause in the proposed Trade
                            Agreement, I have the honor to inform the Department that during a
                            social visit I paid yesterday evening on the Chief Executive and his
                            wife, the subject of trade came up, and General Enríquez declared that
                            he regretted that the United States and Ecuador could not reach an
                            agreement, since Ecuador was so poor and entirely dependent on its
                            customs receipts that it was unable to make the necessary concessions.
                            The Dictator went on to say that the most-favored-nation clause was so
                            different from Ecuador’s policy that should Ecuador adopt it now, it
                            would have to change all its treaties concluded with other countries. In
                            reply, I pointed out the benefits of the most-favored-nation policy and
                            called the General’s attention to the large number of countries with
                            which the United States had already concluded agreements on this basis,
                            which were proving mutually advantageous to the parties thereto. General
                            Enriquez asserted that he would discuss the matter again with his
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0528"/>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the Chief Executive does not seem inclined to change, on his
                            own initiative, the policy of his predecessor in this respect, and as
                            Sr. C. M. Larrea, the same Foreign Minister is in office under the
                            present régime, it appears unlikely that the Ecuadorean Government will
                            recede from its position regarding the trade balance clause.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the United States has deeply regretted the fact that
                            there have been unforeseen delays in the negotiations for a trade
                            agreement with the Government of Ecuador. This Government has looked
                            forward to the active participation of the Government of Ecuador,
                            through the medium of a trade agreement, in its program for the
                            liberalization of world trade, and has continued to hope that a mutually
                            satisfactory solution would be found at an early date of the problems
                            that have arisen during the course of those negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is firmly convinced of the advantages
                            to be gained by all trading nations from the progressive removal of
                            restrictive barriers to the free flow of international trade in its
                            natural channels. The diverse and often complementary nature of the
                            products of the various trading countries indicates the necessity for
                            generally expanding markets rather than limited markets. The latter are
                            the inescapable result of restrictive measures and the artificial
                            diversion of trade through bilateral balancing between pairs of
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>In the current negotiations for a trade agreement between Ecuador and the
                            United States, the Government of Ecuador has made the observation <pb
                                n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0529"/>that it would be very difficult
                            for it to make any reductions in its import duties which might have the
                            effect of weakening its financial position at a time when existing
                            revenues were already declared to be insufficient for the country’s
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>With reference to this observation, it may be pointed out that the
                            Government of the United States expects in a trade agreement with
                            Ecuador only such concessions and assurances as the Government of
                            Ecuador believes can be given without prejudice to the national economy.
                            At the same time, this Government believes that while reductions in
                            import duties in a trade agreement may temporarily lower government
                            revenues from this source, increased imports made possible by such
                            reductions may well result in customs revenues as large as, or larger
                            than, those collected prior to the duty reductions.</p>
                        <p>It is stated, however, that it is impossible for Ecuador to increase its
                            purchases because in order to buy more it must sell more, and the
                            proposed trade agreement with the United States does not seem, in the
                            opinion of the Government of Ecuador, to promise the attainment of the
                            last-named objective. The Government of the United States calls
                            attention to the fact that possible concessions and assurances to
                            Ecuador, on the basis of 1935 Ecuadoran statistics embrace 94.4 percent
                            of Ecuador’s exports to the United States, deducting mineral earth and
                            precious metals from the totals. This extremely high trade coverage
                            deserves careful consideration in appraising the value of a trade
                            agreement such as the United States has proposed. It would of course not
                            be just for the United States to be penalized for having permitted the
                            largest part of its imports from Ecuador to enter this country free of
                            import duties in past years. This would imply that only by having
                            granted less favorable customs treatment to Ecuadoran products in the
                            past, could this Government now extend more favorable treatment.</p>
                        <p>Another consideration merits mention at this point. In addition to the
                            direct benefits accruing to Ecuador from association and cooperation
                            with the United States in liberal trade policies as worked out in a
                            trade agreement are the indirect benefits arising from trade agreements
                            made by the United States with countries constituting important markets
                            for Ecuadoran products. Benefits for Ecuador cannot help but result when
                            the purchasing power of its customers is improved. This Government has
                            only recently announced intention to negotiate an agreement with the

                            relations between these countries and the United States on an
                            unconditional most-favored-nation basis should stimulate the demand for
                            Ecuadoran products in those countries.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the desire expressed by the Government of Ecuador that
                            the proposed trade agreement contain a proviso limiting the extension of
                            unconditional most-favored-nation treatment to the United States to such
                            periods as the trade balance between the two counries is “favorable” to
                            Ecuador, this Government does not question the need of Ecuador to
                            maintain an active merchandise trade balance in the total of its
                            international accounts with all foreign nations in order to meet
                            “invisible” obligations. However, this Government has consistently
                            maintained the view that it is a practical impossibility for this
                            condition to be worked out successfully by pairs of countries, that is,
                            by the bilateral balancing of the trade one country has with each other
                            country with which it carries on business. In fact, attempts so to apply
                            this principle inevitably tend to nullify many of the gains that result
                            from international trade, by artificial diversion of trade from its
                            natural channels. Various studies made in recent years have shown
                            incontrovertibly that when trade is forced into artificial channels, its
                            volume tends to decline and supply and cost factors have to be
                            disregarded to some extent.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is most gratified to note the
                            increasing number of important trading nations which are joining with it
                            in the furtherance of its trade-agreement program. It is hoped that in
                            the near future the negotiations already begun with the Government of
                            Ecuador, may culminate in the conclusion of a mutually advantageous
                            trade agreement.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit the following
                            additional data concerning the actual political situation as regards the
                            next Presidential period.</p>
                        <p>President Martínez’ quiet efforts to sound out public opinion and enlist
                            support for his program of “constitutional reform”, which really means
                            extension of his period in the office of President, have become a matter
                            of general knowledge. There has been no press publicity but the news has
                            spread by word of mouth and public opinion is being formed. This opinion
                            is divided, but the trend seems to be adverse to the proposal. The
                            wealthiest Salvadorans and leaders of the foreign groups as well as the
                            political job-holders encourage the continuance in office of President
                            Martínez. The foreign businessmen and wealthier Salvadorans are inspired
                            by fear of the menace of “communism” and remember his record in that
                            regard. They feel that he can suppress any efforts of radical elements
                            to assume control. They are ruled by fear rather than love.</p>
                        <p>Desire to retain their present positions is the guiding motive of the
                            group in Government service who favor the continuance. The present
                            Government officials are by no means united in this regard. I should say
                            that two cabinet ministers favor continuance, one is neutral, and one
                            has told me that he would resign rather than support the proposal. <pb
                                n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0533"/>A large part of the population
                            is voiceless, but nearly all elements of the country intelligent enough
                            to have an opinion resent the idea of “continuismo”, the word commonly
                            used to express the idea of continuance in office by a President beyond
                            his legal term.</p>
                        <p>I have a number of close contacts among physicians who look upon me as a
                            medical colleague and are wont to discuss freely in my presence the
                            things that interest them. They come in contact with all elements, and
                            their conversations are illuminating as to the ebb and flow of public
                            opinion. Continuation in office of General Martínez has now become a
                            matter of general discussion. Censorship of the press is rigid, but
                            freedom of verbal expression can not be suppressed in Salvador. At
                            social gatherings, groups of intimates collect and political discussion
                            begins. Up to the present they have been conducted without heat, but
                            signs are plentiful that this matter of “continuismo” will become a
                            burning question long before the date of the next election.</p>
                        <p>Powerful elements in the Martínez administration oppose the program. As
                            reported above, one cabinet minister … told me he would resign if
                            Martínez persisted in his efforts to prolong his period beyond the time
                            for which he was elected, and he has been one of Martínez’ steadiest
                            supporters. Two other cabinet ministers … are using their powerful
                            influence in favor of prolongation of the Presidential period. Their
                            influence and the apparent desire of the Executive seem to be dominant
                            at present. … maintains a neutral attitude.</p>
                        <p>Indications are plentiful that there will be fierce and determined
                            opposition from important sections of the Army as well as the general
                            public. If the characteristic stubbornness of the Executive manifests
                            itself in a determination to force the issue, even in the face of an
                            adverse public opinion, there is likely to be a reaction fraught with
                            troublesome possibilities. Disturbance of public order may well
                            occur.</p>
                        <p>Motivated by the belief that its influence as representing the Government
                            of the United States could be a determining factor in the controversy,
                            various efforts have been made by both of the opposing camps to sound
                            out or influence the attitude of the Legation.</p>
                        <p>Some of these efforts have been referred to in previous despatches (No.
                            1033 of May 25, 1937, and No. 1054 of June 30, 1937<note n="2"

                        <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0534"/>
                        <p>Consideration of the Department is now invited to the probability that
                            maintenance of this completely negative attitude will weigh heavily in
                            favor of the program of constitutional “reform” and “continuismo” by
                            giving it tacit approval. It is bound to be so construed. I trust that I
                            have correctly interpreted the Department’s policy, but as the
                            responsibility is very grave and since the instruction referred to was a
                            general one, I would appreciate instructions applying to the case in
                            point for further guidance of the Legation’s attitude as the situation
                            becomes more acute.</p>
                        <p>So that the Department may be fully informed in the premises, I hope that
                            I may be pardoned for expressing a personal viewpoint which, of course,
                            in no way affects my official actions as directed by the Department’s
                            instructions. There arises in this instance the old question of
                            reconciliation of the completely cold “hands off” interpretation as
                            against the warmer implications which seem to me to be inherent in the
                            “Good Neighbor” policy. I am heartily in accord with the policy of
                            non-interference in Salvadoran affairs. Forcible intervention in America
                            properly belongs to an age that is past. However, the moral influences
                            of this and other missions in the American republics continues to be a
                            potent factor which can be utilized for good ends. I am sure no American
                            would wish these missions to lose prestige so long as that prestige is
                            based on good will and fair dealing. It would be premature to try to set
                            forth at once the policies that should be adopted so as to best utilize
                            this power for good. Emphasis up to the present has been placed upon the
                            negative, or “hands off” phase of our continental policy. The present
                            situation in El Salvador shows clearly that a negative attitude may have
                            a positive result, and perhaps one not to our liking. The actual
                            replacement of democratic institutions by dictatorial or Fascist régimes
                            in many Latin American countries, and the imminence of its happening
                            here, brings up the question of whether there is not a moral
                            responsibility implicit in the interpretation of the “Good Neighbor”
                            policy. The simile of a fire in the neighbor’s barn is here in
                            point.</p>

                                York.</note> is still actively interested in a loan of the nature
                            outlined in the said enclosures and was this week sending a
                            representative to Washington to ascertain the Department’s attitude
                            toward such loan so that he (Darnet) hoped to Send Vincent something
                            more definite on or before March 6.</p>
                        <p>Leger said that if such a refunding loan could be arranged there is no

                            Schroder and Company had an interview with Duggan<note n="9"

                                American Affairs.</note> on March 1 in which he stated that Schroder
                            and Company were still interested in forming a banking group in which
                            presumably substantial American interests would participate for floating
                            a refunding and construction loan for Haiti. Bogdan stated Schroder’s
                            interest was predicated on a substantial portion of this proposed loan
                            being exchangeable for German marks in order to release frozen credits
                            in Germany of American firms. These marks would be used in the purchase
                            of equipment and supplies for construction and for the payment of the
                            services of Swiss Brown Bouverie as public works contractors. Bogdan
                            affirmed that Darnet produced several letters from Leger which made it
                            clear <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that Haiti had no objection to a
                            certain amount of blocked marks or to the use of German construction
                            equipment and that for a refunding loan Haiti would sell or pledge the
                            Bank and permit customs control by the bankers.</p>
                        <p>With reference to paragraph 3 of your telegram, while the Department
                            agrees that it is regrettable that negotiations for a protocol should be
                            further delayed, it does not feel that it would care to take any steps
                            which might later give the Haitian Government any grounds for alleging
                            that this Government intervened to prevent Haiti obtaining a refunding
                            loan at this time.</p>

                        <p>5. Department’s telegram No. 5, March 6, 1 p.m., refers to alleged
                            letters from Leger, making it clear that for a refunding loan Haiti
                            would permit customs control by the bankers (see also my despatches Nos.
                            434 and 439 of March 8 and 9, respectively<note n="10" xml:id="d532fn10"
                                >Neither printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>I am now informed that in conversations this week between Leger and the
                            fiscal representative,<note n="11" xml:id="d532fn11">Sidney de la
                                Rue.</note> the former stated categorically that <pb n="528"
                                xml:id="pg_528" facs="0538"/>the Haitian Government would not grant
                            such customs control. The fiscal representative pointed out that if
                            Darnet is representing in New York that the Haitian Government will
                            grant such customs control, and the Government is determined not to do
                            so, a situation will eventually be precipitated where Haitian credit is
                            likely to suffer. Leger agreed but insisted that on the present occasion
                            Schroder could not have received any such false impression from Darnet
                            as he (Leger) had been careful to tell Darnet specifically that the
                            Haitian Government would not assign customs control.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that it would clarify matters and help bring them to a
                            head if the Department would authorize me to tell Leger that I have been
                            informed that although the Haitian Government is not prepared to grant
                            customs control for a refunding loan, in New York, Darnet is
                            representing that the Haitian Government is prepared to do so; also, at
                            the same time I think it would also be helpful to point out that Leger
                            is in error in believing and stating that the Department has
                            affirmatively stated that it has no objection to this new loan
                            proposition and that it is friendly thereto.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s instructions will be appreciated.</p>

                                n="13" xml:id="d533fn13">Despatch not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Department has given careful consideration to the remarks made by Mr.
                            Bogdan with respect to the proposed loan plan in which Schroder and
                            Company is interested. In keeping with its present policy, the
                            Department will not express any views regarding the loan project to
                            Schroder and Company. It does desire, however, to lay certain
                            observations before the Haitian Government and to urge their most
                            careful consideration. Accordingly, unless you perceive objection to the
                            observations set forth hereafter, you should request, at the first
                            opportunity, an interview with President Vincent, or if <pb n="529"
                                xml:id="pg_529" facs="0539"/>you deem it preferable, with the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, and present to him orally the following
                            views of this Government.</p>
                        <p>You may say that this Government is prompted to present certain
                            considerations to the Haitian Government because of its truly sincere
                            interest in the welfare of Haiti. It feels confident that the Haitian
                            Government will receive these observations in the same spirit they are
                            made, and will appreciate that they arise out of a desire that the
                            Haitian Government be in possession of certain information and matured
                            judgments before making any decision as to a loan. This Government,
                            moreover, far from desiring to see any obstacles raised to the security
                            of a refunding loan would welcome a loan that would terminate its
                            financial responsibilities in Haiti.</p>
                        <p>I. After this preliminary statement, you may say that the Department
                            understands that the sole interest of Schroder and Company in a loan to
                            Haiti is to liberate all or part of blocked mark credits in Germany
                            belonging to certain clients of Schroder and Company. Inasmuch as these
                            blocked mark credits can be only employed for purchases in Germany, it
                            is presumed that the Haitian Government would use them for the purchase
                            of construction equipment and materials in Germany to be used in its
                            public works projects, and, if possible, for the remuneration of the
                            engineering and other services to be performed in connection with such
                            projects by some European contracting firm such as Brown, Bouverie and
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>It is the understanding of the Department, from various conversations
                            which its representatives have held with representatives of the Haitian
                            Government, that leaving aside for the moment the question of the

                            desire of the Haitian Government in contracting at this time for a
                            public works loan, has been twofold:</p>
                        <p>First, to undertake projects which will augment directly the economic
                            prosperity of the country, such as the building of new roads and the
                            improvement of existing roads and trails, the construction of drainage
                            and irrigation ditches, of drying platforms for coffee, and of harbor
                            facilities in the ports of secondary importance.</p>
                        <p>Second, to provide ample funds for absorbing Haitian labor in these
                            economically sound public works projects, pending the increased general
                            prosperity so confidently expected as a result of President Vincent’s
                            wise encouragement and development of the coffee, banana and other
                            industries, which would be directly benefited by the public works in
                            question.</p>
                        <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>Public works projects of the type mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs
                            require, as a general rule, a minimum of equipment and a maximum of
                            labor. Aside from bridges, road construction equipment, tools, cement
                            and other materials, and the services of a few foreign experts, the
                            goods or services which need to be purchased outside of Haiti are
                            limited. Unless the works to be undertaken are much vaster in scale than
                            has so far been indicated, and unless the prices for the material to be
                            imported are higher than those obtaining for such material throughout
                            the world generally, it is consequently difficult to see how, from an
                            economic point of view, any considerable quantity of blocked mark
                            credits could be advantageously employed by Haiti. It is presumed that
                            the Haitian Government is bearing this in mind.</p>
                        <p>II. It is well known that with the unfavorable exchange situation, and
                            the imperative necessity for concentrating the best class of raw and
                            finished materials and equipment to their own uses, some of the European
                            Governments are exercising very severe control over the selection of
                            commodities which are permitted to be exported against blocked exchange
                            credits. In production, frequent resort is had necessarily to
                            substitutes at the expense of quality in raw materials, and prices are
                            apt to be substantially higher than those in countries whose currencies
                            have international acceptance. Moreover, it is reported that certain
                            countries are actually having difficulty in supplying non-armaments
                            construction material. This uncertainty as to prompt deliveries of
                            material, appears to increase in proportion to the emphasis that is
                            being placed in these countries upon augmenting their own armaments.</p>
                        <p>III. It has been and is the policy of this Government to assist the
                            Haitian Government and Haitian people in securing, at the earliest
                            possible moment, complete control over the conduct of their own affairs.
                            In keeping with this policy, the United States was happy to terminate,
                            prior to the expiration of the treaty, its connections with Haitian
                            affairs, with the exception of financial matters which were the subject
                            of a special accord in 1933.<note n="15" xml:id="d533fn15">Agreement of

                            indicated his entire willingness to negotiate a new accord<note n="16"

                            States financial control would be substituted by an arrangement for the

                            affairs. For this reason this Government cannot give credit to the
                            representations alleged to have been made by <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531"
                                facs="0541"/>Mr. Pierre Darnet to the J. Henry Schroder Banking
                            Corporation on the basis of letters said to have been written by
                            responsible Haitian officials to the effect that the Haitian Government
                            would, in return for a refunding loan, consider offering the control of
                            the recently acquired National Bank of Haiti and the collection of the
                            Haitian national customs revenues to bankers with whom might be
                            associated foreign bankers and through them foreign governments. In this
                            connection, the Department recalls the frequently reiterated
                            affirmations of various Haitians prominent in public and private life
                            that once free, Haiti would never again submit to foreign control,
                            fiscal or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>This Government was, accordingly, most heartened by the affirmation of
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Finance to the Fiscal
                            Representative that the Haitian Government did not at this time
                            contemplate the assignment of customs control.</p>
                        <p>IV. In conclusion, and as an earnest of its confidence that Haitian
                            policy still is directed towards the complete recovery of its financial
                            sovereignty, this Government desires to reiterate that it stands ready
                            at any time to continue the negotiation of a protocol to terminate
                            official United States financial control in Haiti under such suitable
                            guarantees as may adequately protect the holders of the bonds of the
                            1922 Haitian loan. The Minister of the United States is prepared to
                            carry forward the negotiations at the convenience of the Haitian
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>8. I have just presented orally to the Foreign Minister our Government’s
                            views as set forth in the Department’s instruction No. 458 of March 15.
                            In the ensuing conversation which lasted an hour the Foreign Minister
                            made the following statements:</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government has no intention of granting customs control in
                            return for a refunding loan. If necessary, the Haitian Government would
                            be prepared to set up something in the bank in the nature <pb n="532"
                                xml:id="pg_532" facs="0542"/>of an attenuated “bank plan” to
                            guarantee the service of the loan; so far, however, nothing of the kind
                            has been suggested and the Foreign Minister’s proposal to Schroder has
                            only dealt with this point by stating that the bank would remain the
                            exclusive agency for receiving Government moneys upon which there would
                            be a first lien for the service of the loan.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister has made the following proposal to the potential
                            lenders: the Haitian Government to sell them a two-thirds interest in
                            the bank for $1,000,000 in cash—all profits made by the bank to be
                            distributed prior to the sale—the capital to be increased by $500,000,
                            to be taken by the Haitian Government which would thus retain a
                            one-third interest in the bank with proportionate representation on the
                            Board of Directors; concessions under which the bank operates to be made
                            conterminous with the life of the loan.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister declared that he intended immediately to write
                            Schroder to clear up the discrepancy arising from statements being made
                            in the United States that the Haitian Government is willing to grant
                            customs control.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government has no special interest in buying German
                            construction material; if a reasonable refunding loan proposition were
                            presented to the Haitian Government which included the purchase of
                            American building material the Haitian Government would be better
                            pleased. However, if the only feasible refunding loan proposition made
                            to the Haitian Government comprises the purchase of German building
                            material the Foreign Minister was willing to buy with blocked marks just
                            as much of such material as he needed and no more; his position in this
                            respect remains as he had stated it to the fiscal representative for
                            communication to Schroder (see enclosure No. 2 to my despatch No. 426 of
                            February 25<note n="18" xml:id="d534fn18">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>I spent some time stressing the considerations set forth in section II of
                            the Department’s instruction under reference. The Foreign Minister said
                            he understood these points and that he was prepared to take all
                            necessary precautions. I told him that, speaking personally, I had had
                            considerable opportunity to observe at first hand a [apparent omission]
                            to unload blocked marks as well as to unfreeze exchange credits of other
                            denominations and after pressing this point upon him in some detail he
                            did seem to be somewhat impressed.</p>
                        <p>As regards the point of granting customs control to bankers with whom
                            might be associated foreign bankers and through them foreign
                            governments, the Foreign Minister said that he knew nothing of any
                            foreign bankers being connected with the Schroder proposition. When I
                            asked him about Brown Bouverie and reminded him that when the Debachy
                                loan<note n="19" xml:id="d534fn19">See <ref

                                <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0543"/>represented as having both
                            a contracting and a financing interest, he said that as far as he knew
                            they were only in it as contractors and he was unaware of their having
                            any interest in the financing of the scheme; he had thought that through
                            the London house of Schroder some English money might be participating
                            in the loan but he knew nothing definite even as to this and was unaware
                            of any other foreign money being involved. It was evident that the
                            Foreign Minister felt that he had made considerable progress in the
                            Schroder negotiations and was quite sanguine of the loan going through.
                            One interesting piece of information was that White, Weld and Co. had
                            recently sent a representative to see him. The Foreign Minister said he
                            told this representative that he had authorized Schroder to proceed with
                            the formulation of a loan proposition and the formation of an
                            underwritings group and had suggested that White, Weld might desire to
                            participate in the Schroder group. I take it that a permissible
                            inference therefrom is that White, Weld had nothing more attractive to
                            offer than Schroder. The Foreign Minister agreed that if in spite of his
                            expectations the loan were to break down on the question of customs
                            control it was better to know it at once than to proceed further under a
                            misapprehension, and it was desirable to clear this up and bring the
                            matter to a head as soon as possible; he also admitted that if the loan
                            were to break down it was high time to proceed actively with the
                            negotiations for a protocol terminating our financial control.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 4.64 of
                            April 6,<note n="20" xml:id="d535fn20">Not printed.</note> reporting
                            that President Vincent professed to believe that the Schroder
                            negotiations were progressing well, I have the honor further to report
                            that the Foreign Minister yesterday expressed the same view to the
                            Fiscal Representative and said that he now had good reason to believe
                            that the negotiations would lead to a satisfactory agreement, and from
                            letters he had received he felt that this agreement would be reached
                            prior to August 1; while he realized that the money from the loan would
                            probably not be forthcoming until the autumn, he hoped in the loan
                            contract to include a stipulation for an advance, at the time of signing
                            the contract, sufficiently large to enable the Haitian Government to
                            start on its public works program.</p>
                        <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0544"/>
                        <p>M. Léger said he accordingly felt that it would be futile for him to
                            conduct conversations with the Fiscal Representative looking to the
                            formulation of a satisfactory Bank Plan and the consequent signature of
                            a protocol terminating our financial control.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: During the last week, the new Haitian
                                Minister<note n="21" xml:id="d536fn21">ElieLescot.</note> has called
                            a number of times at the Department for informal conversations with
                            regard to the proposed loan by the J. Henry Schroder Banking
                            Corporation, and the suspended negotiations with this Government for the
                            termination of official United States financial control in Haiti. The
                            attached memoranda,<note n="22" xml:id="d536fn22">Not printed.</note>
                            and other documents, fully summarize these conversations.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the Minister has stated his belief that the
                            negotiations for conclusion of the protocol which will terminate United
                            States financial control in Haiti should be resumed and expedited.
                            Furthermore, in his undated memorandum which was communicated under
                            cover of a personal letter to Mr. Welles of April 30, 1937,<note n="23"
                                xml:id="d536fn23">Neither printed.</note> the Minister appears to
                            advance only two main points of difference between the two Governments
                            with respect to the proposed protocol, namely, (1) the amount to be
                            allocated to the National Bank for carrying on the “Treasury” and other
                            services to be entrusted to it upon the abolition of the office of the
                            Fiscal Representative, and (2) the size of the personnel that is to form
                            the so-called “Government Side” of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>It will also be noted that the Department with regard to the first point,
                            has suggested for consideration a fixed annual amount of 800,000
                            gourdes, and with regard to the second, has pointed out that the plan as
                            suggested by this Government envisages a curtailment of fifty percent in
                            the number of Americans now in the service of the Fiscal Representative,
                            who are to be transferred to the National Bank. The Haitian Minister
                            expressed the belief that his Government would be satisfied with these
                            two proposals and added that he would, on his part, urge the acceptance
                            of this solution upon his Government.</p>
                        <p>At some appropriate time in the near future you are requested, unless you
                            perceive objection to these most recent proposals, to inform the <pb
                                n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0545"/>Minister of Foreign Relations
                            that this Government not only stands ready, but desires to conclude the
                            negotiations for the termination of United States financial control in
                            Haiti, and that as a solution of the only two important points which it
                            is understood, stand in the way of a final agreement, the Department is
                            prepared to suggest for consideration the proposals above mentioned. You
                            may add that the Department has arrived at these proposals only after
                            mature consideration, animated as always by its desire to meet
                            legitimate Haitian aspirations as far as may be consistent with the
                            responsibilities which both Governments have assumed with respect to the
                            holders of the bonds of the Haitian loans of 1922.</p>
                        <p>It seems scarcely necessary to say that the Department relies on your
                            discretion not to embarrass the Haitian Minister here. M. Lescot has
                            given every evidence of being extremely frank and helpful in his
                            approach to the Department … M. Lescot, it may be added in conclusion,
                            has admitted that his knowledge of the more intimate and detailed phases
                            of the Schroder loan proposal and the protocol negotiations is somewhat
                            limited, and the Department, therefore, is unable to judge how much of
                            his belief that the Haitian Government would accept the two new
                            proposals of this Government, is founded in fact on the position of the
                            Haitian Government and how much is founded on his own desire to be
                            cooperative.</p>

                        <p>15. With reference to the Department’s instruction No. 478 of May 7,
                            received this morning and more especially the last sentence thereof, I
                            greatly fear that Lescot’s belief is principally founded on his own
                            desire to be cooperative.</p>
                        <p>My despatch No. 470 of April 8 and previous communications to the
                            Department show that Leger has consistently been unwilling to proceed
                            with protocol negotiations as long as he thought he had any chance of
                            getting a refunding loan. He now professes to think that this chance is
                            better than ever and in view thereof he suggested to de la Rue (who
                            arrives in New York today) that he take his vacation now rather than in
                            August.</p>

                                oblige the Government, after the eventual repayment of the 1922
                                loan, to undertake a new reorganization of the said services.
                                Moreover, Haitian public opinion, which has always understood that
                                the Haitian Government <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0547"/>had
                                made the purchase of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti for
                                the purpose of terminating the control of the Office of the Fiscal
                                Representative, would not understand why the operation simply
                                resulted in transferring the said Office as it is now organized and
                                with almost the same powers to the National Bank of the Republic of
                                Haiti.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Haitian Government is of the opinion that the Office of the Fiscal
                            Representative should be Haitianized and should be kept as a permanent
                            part of the Haitian financial organization. It thinks that, furthermore,
                            in order to give satisfaction to the American Government and the holders
                            of 1922, an additional Service of Control should be organized in the
                            National Bank of the Republic of Haiti, which Service would be scheduled
                            for elimination as soon as the 1922 loan was repaid.</p>
                        <p>Such is the fundamental opinion of the Haitian Government, which opinion
                            has been set forth and developed at length.</p>

                            honor to transmit herewith a copy of a note received this morning from
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<note n="30" xml:id="d541fn30"><hi

                                540</ref>.</note> As he only transmitted this one copy and I am
                            anxious to get it off today before I leave, I am enclosing it without
                            waiting to have further copies made. A translation of the note will be
                            forwarded by the next air mail.</p>
                        <p>I have made a few pencil notations on this copy of points in the note
                            which seem to me especially defective, which I trust will be
                            self-explanatory. It will be noted that Leger has not attempted to
                            formulate counter-proposals to the proposals which I submitted to him on
                            December 23, as he has frequently indicated that he would do. As the
                            Department will observe the note closes by saying that if the American
                            Government has any modifications to propose to the original Haitian
                            proposals of last November the Haitian Government will be glad to
                            examine them, quite regardless of the fact that this is just what we
                            did—six months ago.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with Léger I pointed out to him that this note does not
                            advance matters; it merely reiterates objections to our position which
                            he and I had gone over time and again and which I have reported to the
                            Department, and gets us nowhere. I said that as I had submitted to him a
                            detailed and carefully worked out plan of organization, the logical
                            procedure was for him in his turn to work out a plan of organization
                            differing from ours in the respects which he did not find acceptable,
                            and that the most practical way to set about this—as he had already
                            expressedly realized—was to get down to the discussion of specific
                            details with the Fiscal Representative.</p>
                        <p>Léger then said that this was true and that on reflection he thought that
                            this was just what he would do in the near future.</p>
                        <p>I shall be glad to report more fully orally, when I reach the Department
                            next week, this conversation with Léger.</p>

                            <p>You have been good enough to note the agreement which exists between
                                your Government and the Haitian Government with regard to the text
                                of the proposed protocol transmitted by Your Excellency the 18th of
                                November, 1936, and to express the sentiment that the several points
                                with regard to the proposed note which would form part of the
                                protocol, and concerning which disagreement persists, do not seem to
                                you to be important points nor to raise difficulties of a kind to
                                prevent the conclusion of a final agreement. In this connection, you
                                have gone on to show that when the question of the purchase of the
                                National Bank of the Republic of Haiti by the Haitian Government and
                                that of the termination of financial control in Haiti were raised in

                                Governments, as this is understood by the American Government, was
                                that the essential services of the office of the Fiscal
                                Representative should be transferred to the National Bank of the
                                Republic of Haiti. Your Excellency adds that although there have
                                been changes in the personnel of those who were the negotiators in
                                1934, its common intention has remained unchanged and consequently
                                your Government believes it necessary to record in writing certain
                                obligations of the Haitian Government which, according to Your
                                Excellency, although they were assumed verbally are nevertheless in
                                existence.</p>
                            <p>It is scarcely necessary to say that the Haitian Government does not
                                intend to escape from any obligations it has taken, but, since Your
                                    <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0551"/>Excellency has wished
                                to recall from the beginning of your communication of December 21,
                                1936, the circumstances which surrounded the negotiations of 1934,
                                and the conditions which, according to what your Government
                                understands, were determined upon with a view to the purchase of the
                                National Bank of the Republic of Haiti and of the termination of
                                American financial control, I take the liberty of setting forth the
                                viewpoint of the Haitian Government in this regard.</p>
                            <p>The purchase of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti was
                                effected by the Haitian Government at the price of a very great
                                sacrifice considering the financial resources of the Republic. The
                                goal which the Haitian Government aimed at in making this purchase
                                was that it might be enabled to put an end to the financial control
                                of the American Government in Haiti. The Haitian Government indeed
                                consented to accord reasonable guarantees to the holders of the loan
                                of 1922, but it never entered its mind to substitute purely and
                                simply the control of these bondholders for that of the American
                                Government. The conversations which took place between the
                                representatives of the two Governments with regard to the extent of
                                the new control to be organized in favor of the bondholders in the
                                National Bank of the Republic of Haiti, ended with the drawing up of
                                a draft letter and of a memorandum, the text of which was
                                satisfactory to the two high contracting parties. The signature of
                                these drafts has been deferred only by reason of the fact that
                                delays occurred in concluding and putting into force the final
                                contract of purchase of the National Bank of the Republic of
                                    Haiti.<note n="33" xml:id="d542fn33">See <ref
                                        target="frus1935v04#pg_703"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                        pp. 703</ref> ff.</note></p>
                            <p>The Haitian Government believes and supports the contention that this
                                proposed letter and proposed memorandum of 1934 are the final
                                results of the conversations of 1934. Your Excellency, moreover, in
                                the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> which you kindly
                                communicated to me November 18, 1936, recognized explicitly that the
                                American Government for the past two years has at all times been
                                disposed to sign these agreements only with the modifications which
                                would bring them up to date.</p>
                            <p>The Haitian Government believes that there should be no question now
                                of modifying these drafts in the sense of an aggravation of the
                                conditions of control granted to the bondholders. From May 1934 to
                                date the debt of the Republic of Haiti has considerably diminished,
                                the Series B bonds of the loan have been entirely paid off, thus
                                relieving the budget of the Republic of quite a heavy annual charge
                                and rendering more certain the situation of the creditors of the
                                State; it seems therefore that in all logic, if changes have to be
                                made in the documents of 1934, these should be rather in the sense
                                of a relief from the proposed control.</p>
                            <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0552"/>
                            <p>Now it is indisputable that the new texts proposed by Your Excellency
                                constitute an aggravation and an extension of the rights of control,
                                already very large, which the Haitian Government has accepted to
                                give the bondholders, and which had been agreed to by your
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Notably the obligation which your Government desires to impose on the
                                Haitian Government of obtaining the previous agreement of the Bank
                                as to the availability of funds before opening supplementary or
                                extraordinary credits is a new addition to the draft agreement of
                                1934 and an aggravation of that agreement. Since the Haitian
                                Government undertakes not to open credits unless funds are
                                available, it is certain that it will take care to assure itself,
                                before opening any credits, that funds are available, but it does
                                not intend to find itself under the obligation of having to obtain
                                the agreement of the Director of the National Bank of the Republic
                                of Haiti in such circumstances. Such an obligation, if it were
                                accepted by the Government, would perpetuate practically the same
                                situation created by the Agreement of August 7, 1933.</p>
                            <p>I permit myself once more to remark that the texts of 1934 in no wise
                                imperil the interests of the bondholders for, if the Government
                                should forget itself by taking credits when no funds existed, the
                                Bank could always refuse to issue the checks. Your Excellency has
                                kindly expressed the satisfaction of the American Government with
                                the Haitian Government in the counter-project which it has submitted
                                retaining what Your Excellency denominates the essential phrase of
                                Article 10 as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p rend="flushleft">“It (the Bank) would also have the duty of
                                        informing the Secretary of State for Finance of any error
                                        which might creep into an order sent to it for payment or in
                                        the documents of justification which accompany this
                                        order.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>Your Excellency thinks that the Ministry of Foreign Relations will
                                agree that such a stipulation calls for the installation in the
                                National Bank of a “Service of Prior Examination (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Controle</hi>) of Government Payments”, of a “Service of Public
                                Accounting”, as well as of a “Service of Issuance of Checks”, all of
                                these things which are stipulated in the first phrase of Article 10
                                of the project proposed by your Government.</p>
                            <p>I regret that I am not able to give the agreement of my Government in
                                this matter. The Haitian Government does not believe that in order
                                to enable the Bank to point out “any error which might creep into an
                                order for payment”, it ought to be necessary to transfer to the said
                                Bank the complete financial organization of the Republic of Haiti.
                                Most of the work, in the opinion of the Haitian Government, should
                                be performed by the permanent cogs of the machine of the <pb n="543"
                                    xml:id="pg_543" facs="0553"/>public finance organization in the
                                Republic of Haiti, such as these cogs are at present organized,
                                which cogs should be retained in the Service of Receipts and
                                Disbursements of the Republic to be created in accordance with the
                                plan which I have had the honor to submit to Your Excellency. The
                                control which the Bank is called upon to make in the interest of the
                                bondholders, would be in this case only one of ultimate control as
                                to the regularity of the documents and would demand only a limited
                                personnel, this personnel in accordance with the Haitian
                                Government’s project would always have the right of access to and of
                                inquiry in the permanent Services created by the Haitian
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Here again I permit myself to insist on the fact that the Haitian
                                Government proposes to rest upon the text which was agreed upon in
                                1934, and that it does not seek consequently in any way to modify
                                the conditions mutually agreed upon between the parties for the
                                termination of financial control by the American Government in
                                Haiti.</p>
                            <p>The Haitian Government willingly gives its consent to the desire of
                                the American Government to see the laws voted by the Haitian
                                legislative chambers which would complete the protocol and the
                                proposed note. The Haitian Government notes with regret that your
                                Government considers that the three proposals submitted to it are
                                based on concepts which the American Government considers different
                                from those which had been envisaged in 1934 and which are those on
                                which the agreement of the American Government for the termination
                                of American financial control had been based. I must not fail to
                                remark, however, that these drafts which I have had the honor to
                                submit to you are the only ones which permit the strict application
                                of the texts of the agreement of 1934 as well as the 2% recognized
                                as due the Bank by the Contract of July 1935. It is evident that the
                                two Governments were not parties to the Contract of Sale of the
                                National Bank of the Republic of Haiti signed July 8, 1935, but it
                                remains true nevertheless that the conditions of this Contract were
                                determined upon with the approbation and under the good offices of
                                the American Government. The Haitian Government was therefore right
                                to think that the precise stipulations in Article 13 of the Contract
                                of July, 1935, could be considered as definite and all the more so
                                since these same stipulations were reproduced in the drafts of 1934
                                decided upon between the Governments. Nevertheless the memorandum
                                which Your Excellency has kindly submitted and which the Haitian
                                Government has studied with greatest interest—a memorandum which
                                shows, as your Government conceives it, the nature and extent of the
                                control to be granted the Bank—implies necessarily the modification
                                of the conditions agreed upon in 1934 and which appears in the
                                Contract of Sale of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti. The
                                2% which had <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0554"/>been foreseen
                                as the Bank’s commission is very evidently insufficient to take care
                                of a budget which would necessitate an organization of the sort
                                proposed by Your Excellency, and if such a plan were to be adopted
                                it would be necessary either to increase the 2% directly or, as Your
                                Excellency suggests, indirectly, by giving the Bank a guaranteed
                                minimum commission which would greatly exceed the probable yield of
                                a 2% commission.</p>
                            <p>The Haitian Government does not deny the friendly spirit with which
                                the American Government has treated the different problems arising
                                out of the liquidation of the Treaty of 1915.<note n="34"

                                will realize the sincere desire which the Haitian Government
                                manifests to give all possible appeasement to the bondholders of the
                                loan of 1922. The Haitian Government believes that it is possible to
                                guarantee entirely the rights of these bondholders by holding to the
                                terms of the conditions agreed upon in 1934 and which have been
                                accepted by the American Government. The proposals which it has
                                formulated and which I have had the honor to submit to Your
                                Excellency have as a basis these proposed agreements of 1934. The
                                Haitian Government, if the American Government has modifications to
                                propose to these projects, will be happy to examine them in the
                                highest spirit of conciliation and it remains persuaded that a
                                common examination of these projects will achieve a solution giving
                                full satisfaction to both Governments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department refers to Mr. Gordon’s
                            despatch No. 499 of June 2, transmitting a copy of a note from the
                            Haitian Minister for Foreign Affairs dated May 31, 1937, which purported
                            to answer the Legation’s note and accompanying documents of December 21,
                            1936.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to call on the Haitian Minister for Foreign Affairs at
                            your early convenience and to make certain observations which are set
                            forth below in reply to the note of May 31, 1937, leaving an <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of your remarks.</p>
                        <p>You may say that the Government of the United States has examined
                            attentively the Minister’s note of May 31, 1937, but regrets to say that
                            in its opinion the statements of the Minister appear to indicate <pb
                                n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0555"/>that the points of view of the
                            two governments seem to be no closer together than was the case some
                            months ago.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States does not feel that to attempt to
                            reply point by point to the arguments raised by the Minister would be
                            profitable to either government, although it cannot let pass unanswered
                            the statement contained in the seventh paragraph of the Minister’s note.
                            The Government of the United States feels sure that upon mature
                            reflection, the Minister will agree that the assertion of the Haitian
                            Government that the new texts proposed by the Government of the United
                            States “constitute an aggravation and an extension of the already large
                            rights of control which the Haitian Government had agreed to give to the
                            bondholders and which were agreed to by your Government” is far from
                            “indisputable (<hi rend="italic">indiscutable</hi>).”</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is convinced for its part that it
                            should be possible without serious difficulty to elaborate a plan
                            satisfactory to both governments for the termination of United States
                            financial control in Haiti, based upon the documents which it has
                            already submitted to the Haitian Government. More specifically, the
                            Government of the United States desires to advance the earnest
                            suggestion that upon Mr. de la Sue’s return to Haiti in the immediate
                            future his services be availed of by the Haitian Government to elaborate
                            with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Finance a plan for the
                            organization of the fiscal or Government side of the National Bank of
                            the Republic of Haiti. The Government of the United States recalls in
                            this connection that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Finance
                            has himself several times advanced the opinion that such a course was
                            the most logical one to follow, and Mr. de la Rue has on his part
                            expressed his readiness to cooperate with Mr. Léger in every way
                            possible to develop such a plan step by step, in the hope of reaching a
                            solution satisfactory to both governments and adequately safeguarding
                            the rights of the bondholders of the 1922 loans.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                        <p>31. Department’s air mail instruction June 17. The Department’s
                            observations with respect to the Haitian Government’s note of May <pb
                                n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0556"/>31, 1937 were communicated to
                            Leger this morning. He said that he was pleased that discussion of the
                            details of the organization of the Government side of the bank could now
                            proceed between de la Rue and himself. He thought something could be
                            worked out. The points of view of the two Governments were not far apart
                            and he stated very plainly that he does not consider the question of the
                            cost of the organization as important as that of its kind. What he
                            really wanted was physically to retain the services now performed by the
                            fiscal representative’s office in the Ministry of Finance where he
                            thought they belonged. These services he believed could be Haitianized
                            just as in the case of the Garde by duplicating personnel during the
                            training period. He wished to see installed in the bank only such
                            control officers as would protect the interests of the bondholders.
                            Discussions with de la Rue would begin as soon as the latter returned
                            unless of course there was some new prospect of a refunding loan in
                            which case they would not be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Proceeding then to the question of acquisition of the possible loan he
                            told me of Bogdan’s prospective arrival today and repeated that the
                            Haitian Government was under no obligation to Schroder but would of
                            course examine any plan that Bogdan had to offer. He said he was not
                            interested in German marks and he also made a point of saying that,
                            following Bogdan’s visit to France this summer, he thought the latter
                            might propose some sort of scheme which would link up a loan with the
                            question of the 1910 bonds. This, he said, he would not tolerate. The
                            two were entirely separate propositions. He would keep me informed as to
                            any developments which might take place.</p>
                        <p>Coming next to the French commercial convention he said that he
                            personally through a third party and not on behalf of the Haitian
                            Government had told the French that he might be willing to adjust the
                            1910 loan question on the basis of the payment of francs 10 million over
                            a 15-year period.<note n="35" xml:id="d544fn35">See <ref
                                    target="#pg_560">pp. 560</ref> ff.</note> I understood him to
                            say that he would not go beyond that figure. The French were apparently
                            holding up the convention because they did not think this adequate. He
                            was very anxious on the other hand to conclude the convention because
                            there were good prospects for a large coffee crop and because they would
                            need the French market this year. In reply to my question he again said
                            that while the conclusion of the convention was not explicitly bound up

                        <p>39. Following interviews he had yesterday with Vincent and Leger, De la
                            Rue informed me that the object of his conversations had been to
                            communicate to them Eberstadt’s new proposal for a $15,000,000 refunding
                            and public works loan. The proposal was, he stated, that $2,500,000
                            should be made available as soon as the loan could be prepared and
                            approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission; another $2,500,000
                            to be made available as soon as possible but within 90 days and the
                            balance to be taken “after October 1, 1937”. The price at which the
                            bonds would be taken would be subject to discussion but Eberstadt would
                            be given the right to handle the refunding operation. The latter would
                            come to Haiti in the near future after he had been invited by the
                            Haitian Government and after receiving assurances from the Haitian
                            Government that it is not already pledged to do business with another
                            firm.</p>
                        <p>De la Rue further stated that both Vincent and Leger have expressed a
                            desire to have Eberstadt come to Haiti at the earliest possible date.
                            Meanwhile, the conversations with regard to the protocol which were
                            agreed upon in the Department on June 14 will, De la Rue states, be
                            postponed.</p>
                        <p>I am forwarding by next air mail the text of De la Rue’s letter to Leger
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Since this is an entirely new <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> concerning
                            which the Legation has only the above information, will the Department

                            believed the terms of the proposal unduly onerous, the ultimate decision

                            Eberstadt has since telegraphed De la Rue that he thought it would take
                            him until about September 1, to push his preparatory work to the point
                            where he could come down here with a fairly definite proposition. Leger
                            feels that it is undesirable to wait that long before even beginning
                            negotiations and accordingly he has sent another message to Eberstadt
                            asking him to come down in the near future even if his proposition has
                            not yet taken definite shape, emphasizing that it seems preferable that
                            there should be discussion of the nature of the security contemplated
                            for the proposed bond issue before Eberstadt’s plans are further
                            advanced.</p>

                            Eberstadt has now informed Leger that the flotation by him and his
                            associates of a refunding and public works loan for Haiti would involve
                            in all probability the nomination of a board of directors of the bank
                            consisting of five members, two of whom would be nominated by the
                            Haitian Government, two by the trustees of the loan and one “by a
                            mutually acceptable agency of the United States Government”. De la Rue
                            understands that Eberstadt has the Federal Reserve Bank in mind as this
                            mutually acceptable agency. Government collections and disbursements
                            would of course be made through the bank.</p>
                        <p>Eberstadt told Leger that the attitude of his prospective associates is
                            lukewarm and that he does not look for much success unless the
                            guarantees can be substantially as stated above. He also stated that he
                            did not see how he would be able to come to Haiti before early
                            September.</p>

                        <p>33. Your 52, July 30, 11 a.m. On July 28, in a conversation with the
                            Chief of the Division of the American Republics, Eberstadt made
                            essentially the same statements regarding the conditions under which he
                            and his associates would undertake the flotation of a public works loan
                            for Haiti which your telegram under reference reports he made to
                            Leger.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Eberstadt was informed that it would be entirely contrary to the
                            policy of this Government to have anything whatsoever to do with the
                            appointment of the fifth member of the Board of Directors of the Bank or
                            in any way assume any responsibilities in connection with the new
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>If inquiry is made by the Haitian Minister for Foreign Affairs as to the
                            attitude of this Government with regard to the Eberstadt proposal, you
                            may make the same statement to him.</p>
                        <p>In concluding his conversation, Mr. Eberstadt said that there might be
                            some other formula which could be worked out which would protect to the
                            same degree the interests of the bondholders and that if such a formula
                            were suggested he, of course, would be only too glad to accept. He
                            stated, however, that he did not wish to recommend to his clients any
                            loan that he himself did not feel was adequately safeguarded and he
                            expressed great doubt as to the possibility of finding any other
                            arrangement which would afford the same degree of protection as that
                            which now exists under the 1922 loan.</p>

                                between the Chief of the Division of the American Republics and Mr.
                                Eberstadt, reported in telegram No. 33, August 2, 4 p.m., <hi

                            certain that Leger, when he replied to Eberstadt was entirely unaware
                            that <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0561"/>the latter proposes to
                            have powers conferred on the fifth member of the bank board
                            substantially identical with those now exercised by the fiscal
                            representative. I am equally certain that he entertained no idea that
                            the American Government would be willing to nominate the fifth member.
                            What he probably had in mind was that the Federal Reserve Bank might, as
                            I understand it recently did in Brazil, name a panel of experts from
                            which the choice could be made or failing that that the Foreign
                            Bondholders Association might do so.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me that the positions of the two parties to this affair are
                            much farther apart than either realizes. De la Rue is hopeful that
                            Eberstadt’s next letter to Leger will make his position clearer and that
                            meanwhile Lancaster and Dulles will have given him a clearer picture of
                            Leger’s position. He has written Lancaster.</p>

                                    1933</hi>.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States, in harmony with its consistent
                                policy of clearing up as rapidly as may be possible the vestiges of
                                its special relationships with certain countries of the Caribbean
                                area, is desirous of concluding a protocol with the Haitian
                                Government which will liquidate official American financial control
                                in Haiti, and will <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0562"/>abrogate
                                the Protocol of October 3, 1919, and the Accord of August 7, 1933.
                                Although equally desirous of recognizing as far as may be possible
                                legitimate Haitian aspirations to obtain complete autonomous control
                                over the collection and allocation of the revenues of the Republic,
                                the Government of the United States, mindful of the responsibilities
                                which it together with the Government of Haiti has assumed towards
                                the holders of the bonds of the 1922 loan, feels that it would not
                                be warranted in agreeing to a protocol whose terms did not provide
                                adequate guarantees for the bondholders. Accordingly, the Government
                                of the United States believes that a protocol with accompanying
                                letter along the broad lines of that submitted to the Haitian
                                Government on November 18, 1936, as amplified by a memorandum of the
                                proposed organization of the National Bank of Haiti, submitted to
                                the Haitian Government on December 23, 1936, represents
                                approximately the minimum guarantees which would adequately
                                safeguard the rights of the bondholders of the 1922 loan. It should
                                be understood, however, that while the Government of the United
                                States holds to the broad basis of the plan which had already been
                                agreed upon between the two governments in 1934, it has no desire to
                                insist rigidly upon the details of this plan.</p>

                                    Construction Loan to Haiti.</hi></p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States would be greatly pleased to see,
                                as a most happy solution of the existing special relationship, a
                                refunding loan to Haiti underwritten by a group of responsible
                                bankers either in this country or elsewhere. While the terms of such
                                a loan can be of no direct concern to this Government, which in any
                                case must stand aloof, the United States would naturally be
                                disappointed, as a sincere friend of Haiti and of the Haitian
                                people, if such terms were unduly onerous or disadvantageous as
                                respects Haiti or if they imply any possibility of future impairment
                                of Haiti’s sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, the Government of the United States feels that the
                                decision whether the Haitian Government prefers to contract a
                                smaller loan in the absence of a refunding loan and the terms upon
                                which any loan might be obtained, are matters purely of concern to
                                the Haitian Government.</p>
                            <p>As has been made clear on various occasions to the Haitian
                                Government, the Government of the United States is unalterably
                                opposed to any new arrangement which might extend or be construed as
                                extending the present American financial control in Haiti.
                                Therefore, the Government of the United States is unable, either
                                directly or indirectly through one of the semi-autonomous
                                organizations under control of this Government, to nominate any
                                official who might serve in any capacity in connection with a future
                                loan to Haiti.</p>

                            <p>The Government of the United States was pleased, at the instance of
                                the Government of Haiti, to exercise again its good offices with
                                respect to the French Government in connection with the demand by a

                                beyond that offered in 1922–23 to the holders of the 1910 Haitian
                                franc loan. The Government of the United States has consistently
                                endorsed the point of view set forth by the Haitian Government, that
                                full and equitable settlement was tendered to the holders of the
                                1910 loan in 1922–23.</p>

                            other basis than that which he seems most unwittingly to have envisaged.

                        <p>In a conversation Pixley<note n="41" xml:id="d555fn41">Rex A. Pixley,
                                Deputy Fiscal Representative.</note> had this morning with Leger the
                            latter discussed in strict confidence the question of a French loan
                            through Barclay’s Bank. The Minister for Foreign Affairs gave Pixley the
                            definite impression that he was momentarily expecting word from France
                            that the situation there had reached such a point that he would be given
                            full powers from the President of Haiti and would immediately return to
                            the United States by air en route to France to sign the documents. The
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs added that the only obstacle to the loan
                            was fear in France of hostilities between Haiti and Santo Domingo.<note

                            the Department transmits to you the text of two telegrams received from
                            the Embassy in Paris sent in reply to an instruction to obtain such
                            information as might be possible with regard to the reported French
                            negotiations for a loan to Haiti. The telegrams are as follows:</p>
                        <p>(Here quote 1602, November 13, 6 p.m., and 1617, November 17, 2 p.m.,
                            from Paris).<note n="44" xml:id="d556fn44">Telegrams not printed.
                                Ambassador Bullitt reported inquiries at the French Treasury,
                                Foreign Office, and Bank of France which indicated that neither the

                                in regard to the Haitian project. (838.51/3482, 3484)</note></p>
                        <p>The contents of these telegrams have been made available to de la Rue who

                        <p>When Leger informed me of the pending negotiations with French interests,
                            I stated to him that the matter was one, of course, solely for
                            determination by the Haitian Government; that I assumed, of course, that
                            the Haitian Government would enter into no loan contract which could in
                            any sense be construed as counter to the prior interests of United
                            States bondholders, nor which would in any way involve political
                            influence in Haiti on the part of European interests, nor which in a
                            general sense would be prejudicial to the best interests of the Haitian
                            people. I added that I knew of the repeated efforts made by the Haitian
                            Government to obtain financial accommodation in the United States and
                            that in view of the failure up to date of these efforts, I recognized
                            the legitimate desire of the Government of Haiti to turn to other
                            sources for such accommodation. I concluded by saying that I trusted
                            that any negotiations which might be consummated would be satisfactory
                            to the Haitian Government and to the best interests of the Haitian
                            people.</p>

                        <p>62. De la Rue informs me that the financial situation in Haiti is
                            becoming alarming and has been further aggravated by the recent drop in
                            coffee prices which threatens to curtail almost entirely the exportation
                            of coffee unless the price to the peasant cultivator can be
                            increased.</p>
                        <p>He has been informed by Leger that the latter is not in favor of the
                            proposed temporary reduction of 33 per cent in the coffee export duty
                            since he is reluctant to change tax structure in view of negotiations
                            for French loan which he believes should be brought to successful
                            conclusion within 20 days. De la Rue feels that internal economic
                            conditions can not continue without some stimulation of coffee trade for
                            that long a period and that meanwhile Haiti’s place in the American
                            coffee market so laboriously gained may be endangered.</p>

                        <p>121. During conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs this
                            morning I inquired regarding the progress of his loan negotiations.
                            (Department’s 59, November 17, 4 p.m.)</p>
                        <p>Leger said that he had explained the matter to the Department as fully as
                            he knew at the time. He was glad, however, to give me the following
                            further information which he had written to De la Rue and assumed had
                            been communicated by the latter to you.</p>
                        <p>This new French loan idea originated in a visit here of a French engineer
                            at the Entreprise Lajoinie who was introduced to Leger in a letter from
                            “his good friend” the French Minister at Ciudad Trujillo recommending
                            this engineer highly and saying that he had the backing of the French
                            Foreign Office. This letter dated October 16 was shown to me by Leger.
                            The matter then proceeded to a point of a firm offer being about to be
                            sent to Leger when difficulties arose, according to him, through French
                            apprehension of the Haitian-Dominican affair. Now, however, as I
                            indicated later in this telegram this obstruction seems to be removed.
                            (There seems to be a certain contradiction in the attitude of the
                            Haitian Government in regard to the Haitian-Dominican affair and the
                            fact that apparently this no longer is considered an obstacle to the
                            French loan.)</p>
                        <p>The loan in the amount of some $20,000,000 is to come from moneys in the
                            possession of a semi-official French institution which originated after
                            the war as a depository for certain funds. As there is no employment
                            locally for these funds the French Government is glad to have them used
                            for the present purpose and the French Foreign Office has approved the
                            same. The issue price will be around 95 and the interest rate apparently
                            quite satisfactory. Leger said nothing regarding the duration of the
                            loan. As the French authorities do not wish to appear in the matter the
                            money will be loaned in the first <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557"
                                facs="0567"/>instance to Barclays Bank who will in turn loan the
                            money either directly to the Haitian Government or through the
                            Entreprise Lajoinie. Leger was a little vague about this point. There is
                            no question of customs control which apparently had not been requested.
                            The guarantee demanded by the French was a continuation of the National
                            Bank of Haiti’s present position with regard to Government funds. Leger
                            felt that eventually some form of foreign overseeing would be requested
                            in the bank on behalf of the creditors. This Leger hoped could be worked
                            out by appointing an American, preferably De la Rue himself.</p>
                        <p>Leger added that he had recently received a cablegram from Paris that a
                            firm offer had been mailed to him November 18. Upon its receipt (if it
                            is satisfactory) he will at once fly to New York, meet De la Rue,
                            apparently discuss the matter further with the Department, sail to
                            France accompanied by De la Rue to settle and sign the loan
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>Leger admitted that the matter seemed to him most extraordinary and
                            miraculous. I indicated discreetly that his own prestige as well as that
                            of his Government was involved in this affair (having in mind the
                            Debalway [<hi rend="italic">Debachy</hi>] affair)<note n="45"
                                xml:id="d559fn45">See <ref target="frus1935v04#pg_667"><hi

                            I had not previously encountered French, or indeed any other, financiers
                            in the role of Santa Claus. Leger agreed to all of this but still felt
                            that remarkable as it was the loan was assured and that everything would
                            work out beautifully. He thought that a loan at this time would be
                            exceedingly helpful not only for Haitian economy but with regard to the
                            Dominican affair.</p>

                        <p>126. Legation’s 124, November 23, 3 p.m.<note n="46" xml:id="d560fn46"
                                >Not printed.</note> In a conversation Pixley has just had with
                            Leger concerning the French loan the latter said that he had now
                            received a telegram signed “Bellamy” from the principals in Paris
                            stating that they were awaiting his arrival there to sign the contract.
                            The principals presumably are the “fonds des bien privees” the
                            semiofficial French institution mentioned in the fourth paragraph of my
                            121, November 22, 4 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>] p.m. According to Leger
                            Entreprise Lajoinie is to have charge of public works construction and
                                <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0568"/>to collect six or seven
                            percent commission on them; that there is no provision that materials
                            must be bought in France and that the loan is in dollars. Leger further
                            indicated to Pixley that his reason for wishing to keep the loan matter
                            secret for the time being was in order to prevent the 1910 bondholders
                            from learning of the loan as there is nothing in it to satisfy them and
                            they might bring influence to bear on the Foreign Office to block
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Leger further informed Pixley that he expected to receive on Sunday the
                            letter said to have been mailed in Paris on November 18 (see second
                            paragraph of my 124, November 23, 3 p.m.) and anticipated leaving by
                            plane on Tuesday en route to France to be accompanied by De la Rue.
                            While in the United States Leger would discuss the whole affair with the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>In order to have everything prepared Leger said that there was to be a
                            Cabinet meeting this morning to approve the loan and to give Leger
                            authority to go to Paris to sign the contract. Leger added that he would
                            permit news of this meeting to leak out today in order to encourage
                            public opinion and help divert it from the Dominican affair. Pixley
                            indicated to Leger the danger of such action if the loan project should
                            not eventuate but Leger thought that this was not a sufficient reason to
                            change his proposed procedure with regard to the Cabinet meeting, et
                            cetera.</p>
                        <p>Pixley understands that this famous letter of November 18 was mailed by
                            Barclay’s Bank in Paris.</p>
                        <p>We also understand that the engineer of the Entreprise Lajoinie with whom
                            Leger dealt here and with whom he has been communicating in Paris is
                            named Dauvin.</p>

                                November 26, 4 p.m., from the Ambassador in France which reported
                                further inquiries at the Foreign Office and Paris branch of
                                Barclay’s Bank, both of which disclaimed any knowledge of the
                                proposed Haitian loan (838.51/3491).</note> Pixley has just learned
                            from Leger that the letter of November 18 has arrived; that since
                            receiving the letter Leger feels that “it is practically certain” that
                            the loan will be worked out and that he is leaving by plane tomorrow
                            night for New York en route to France. Leger has not as yet informed me
                            of the arrival of the letter as he said he would do.</p>
                        <p>If Leger calls me over and discusses the matter, I feel it is only fair
                            to give him the information contained in the Department’s 64, November
                                <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0569"/>27, 3 p.m., in an effort to
                            assist him in every proper way to an understanding of the situation
                            before he takes the final step of leaving Haiti for France. On the other
                            hand from what I now know I am inclined not to volunteer this further
                            information. It seems to me that to do so might only be interpreted by
                            Leger as an effort to block a loan which he appears to believe in his
                            pocket, especially since similar accommodation has not been made to
                            Haiti in the United States. I am all the more of this view because the
                            Department and De la Rue will perhaps have even more definite
                            information by the time Leger should reach the United States and they
                            could then go into the matter with him if they so desired.</p>
                        <p>Would appreciate telephonic instructions if the Department desires me to
                            act otherwise.</p>

                        <p>131. Legation’s 130, November 29, 10 a.m. I have just seen Leger off on
                            the plane to the United States. He called me over to the Foreign Office
                            this morning to say that he had received his letter from Paris, which he
                            did not show me, but which he said satisfied him that there was every
                            probability that he could arrange the loan. He realized the personal
                            risk he was taking but felt that there was justification for going. He
                            would stop off at Washington to talk with the Department. I had the
                            impression, however, that Leger is less certain about the loan, after
                            receipt of the letter; that the matter of guarantees is still unsettled
                            although Leger said he felt that this would work out all right.</p>
                        <p>I told Leger the substance of telegram No. 1666 of November 26, 4 p.m.
                            from the Embassy in Paris to the Department.<note n="48"
                                xml:id="d562fn48">See footnote 47, <ref target="#pg_558">p.
                                    558</ref>.</note> I said that this further information had come
                            in and it seemed only proper that he should have everything we had on
                            the subject, not with any idea whatsoever of obstructing the loan but
                            merely to be helpful. Incidentally, Leger confirmed that the French
                            Chargé d’Affaires had spoken to him recently pursuant to instructions
                            from the Foreign Office in Paris and presumably along the line indicated
                            in the Embassy’s telegram from Paris.</p>
                        <p>Leger said he entirely understood our position in the matter but was
                            somewhat disturbed that our inquiries in Paris might get the matter
                            noised about. I felt it necessary to remark at this juncture that as a
                            matter of fact the object of his trip seemed to be rather generally <pb
                                n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0570"/>known here. For example a
                            private individual had volunteered to us several days ago not only news
                            of the loan project and his trip but actually the names of the
                            negotiators. For the Department’s strictly confidential information this
                            Haitian claimed to have this direct from the President which I believe
                            is correct. Furthermore, the British Minister yesterday told me that
                            Leger himself had spoken to him recently about the loan and his trip to
                            Paris.</p>
                        <p>All the inconsistencies and somewhat incredible circumstances surrounding
                            the French loan negotiations inspire the feeling that we may not know
                            the whole story either of the loan negotiations or of an ulterior motive
                            which may also be involved. Indeed, British Minister indicated to me
                            last night his feeling that Leger may be glad to escape from a political
                            situation here in which he would not wish to be involved.</p>

                        <p>164. President Vincent has received a telegram from Leger stating that in
                            spite of the firm offer of the Biens Privees they are now unable to
                            proceed with the loan. Leger states he has seen the President of the
                            Council who promised to discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance
                            with a view to the immediate conclusion of a loan and a commercial
                            convention. Leger consequently has requested Vincent to hold off further
                            reduction of the coffee export tax for 8 days, but Vincent has,
                            apparently, telegraphed Leger that the situation here is grave and that
                            Paris negotiations must be hastened.</p>

                            exporters were pessimistic as to the possibility of disposing of the
                            next coffee crop in the United States or on European markets other than
                            the French, the President declares that the opinion of the Government,
                            based on thorough inquiries, was that the opening of new markets for
                            Haitian coffee could be realized—on condition of better cooperation from
                            planters and exporters—and in conclusion he says: “This matter seems
                            definitely to be working out to our advantage. In fact, we have a new
                            market and the buying offers which our exporters are receiving greatly

                            Spring and early Summer of 1936 when the President was a prey to
                            constant indecision concerning the possibilities for marketing his next
                            coffee crop outside of France, and consequently concerning his policy
                            towards that country—and the unremitting efforts necessary to keep him
                            from giving way to pessimism and relapsing supinely into a policy of
                            unreasonable dependence upon France, coupled with a yielding to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to amplify as follows my
                            telegram No. 14 of this date.</p>
                        <p>I called upon the Foreign Minister this morning to inquire concerning
                            Franco-Haitian commercial treaty negotiations, stating that I had been
                            informed that more conciliatory instructions had lately been received by
                            the French Minister, and that consequently negotiations were now going
                            ahead on a basis more favorable to Haiti; that I had also been informed
                            that a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> pending the consumption of
                            these negotiations would probably be signed today.</p>
                        <p>M. Léger confirmed this information and stated that as a result of an
                            instruction received yesterday by the French Minister clearing <pb
                                n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0574"/>up the last point at issue, an
                            exchange of notes had been signed today effecting the <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi> in question, according to the terms of which
                            France gives Haiti a quota of approximately 37,000 sacks of coffee to be
                            shipped from here between now and September 1,—the original French
                            proposal for a Haitian coffee quota was predicated upon Haitian coffee
                            stocks in Havre, which of course was not of much interest to the Haitian
                            government. The French receive straight minimum tariff treatment, and in
                            the exchange of notes there is no mention of an <hi rend="italic"
                                >avenant</hi> or of specific tariff reductions for additional
                            non-specialty articles (see my despatches Nos. 447 of March 16 and 453
                            of March 24<note n="63" xml:id="d568fn63">Neither printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>The terms of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> will be published
                            in an official communiqué to be issued this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>M. Leger further informed me that the Haitian and French governments are
                            now quite close together on all important points of the forthcoming
                            commercial agreement, though he anticipates that the treaty will not
                            actually be signed for a month or more because, he said, if he might
                            speak confidentially, “the French are such terrible skinflints (<hi
                                rend="italic">grippe-sous</hi>)”.</p>
                        <p>The basis of the new treaty will be a Haitian coffee quota of some
                            150,000 sacks, with an additional approximately 6,250 sacks for every
                            one million francs worth of French imports into Haiti above a minimum
                            importation by Haiti of ten million francs worth of French goods
                            annually. In this connection Léger said that as Haiti had practically
                            never imported less than ten million francs worth of French goods
                            annually, even when the franc was around 15 to the dollar, he thought
                            there was little chance of this amount of imports proving artificial—i.
                            e., more than the Haitians needed to, or normally would, import—now that
                            the franc was getting nearer to 25 to the dollar.</p>
                        <p>Another point on which he had had trouble with the French was with
                            respect to Haiti’s purchases in France of material for public services.
                            In the earlier stages of the negotiations the French had tried to
                            obligate Haiti to purchase nearly ten million francs of such material
                            annually, which Léger had flatly refused; negotiations now concern a
                            figure of below two million francs annually.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my question as to what he proposed to do concerning the
                            percentage of coffee to be shipped to France in French bottoms, Leger
                            replied that in this connection, as well as with respect to the question
                            of Haitian purchases of French coffee sacks, he did not feel that he
                            could insist on less than the French had had by the exchange of notes
                            and so called gentlemen’s agreement of 1935 (restoring the lapsed treaty
                            of 1930 and <hi rend="italic">avenant</hi> of 1934), but that he had not
                            agreed to anything above those quantities, and he felt that the French
                            would <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0575"/>be satisfied therewith. I
                            may parenthetically observe here that I do not see why M. Léger should
                            not attempt to get better terms at least with respect to the purchase of
                            French coffee sacks, inasmuch as I understand that the local coffee
                            merchants have been very dissatisfied with this provision of the 1935
                            exchange of notes, feeling that the price of French jute coffee sacks is
                            much too high.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of the French 1910 loan claim, Leger recalled
                            that in one of our first conversations after he came into office he had
                            told me that while he would not consent to submit this claim to
                            arbitration or to the Permanent Court, or to make any substantial
                            compromise payment, he would make a “symbolical” payment if that would
                            dispose of the matter (see my telegram No. 46 of October 27, 1936<note
                                n="64" xml:id="d568fn64"><ref target="frus1936v05#pg_680"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1936, vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, p. 680</ref>.</note>). He said he
                            wished now to tell me a little more fully what he had had in mind. The
                            interest collected on 1910 loan bonds of holders who had refused to take
                            paper francs for their holdings amounted to some $521,000. Léger’s idea
                            was to pay ten million francs—approximately $448,000 at present rates of
                            exchange—out of this fund to French claimants if this would dispose of
                            the case once and for all. He felt that a settlement of this nature
                            would be the only kind of an arrangement which would not admit the
                            principle that the Haitians were obligated to pay the 1910 loan in
                            gold.</p>
                        <p>He had not made such a proposal to the French Minister here, but he had
                            let him know that certain Frenchmen interested in the claim had proposed
                            such a scheme and that he, Léger, did not disapprove thereof, so that if
                            the French Government wished to propose such a measure to him as a way
                            of settling the 1910 claim he would be disposed to agree thereto; the
                            French Government, through its Minister here, had replied that any such
                            idea was entirely unacceptable. However, said Léger, the French had
                            abandoned their last year’s position that they would refuse to proceed
                            with negotiations for a new treaty until the Haitian Government had made
                            a concrete step toward settlement of the 1910 claim, and had proceeded
                            with negotiations which now were nearing consummation; consequently
                            Léger said that he wouldn’t be surprised if eventually the French did
                            agree to such a proposition. Even if they did, Léger concluded, he said
                            he had made it clear that the Haitian treasury at present had no cash to
                            pay even this relatively small amount, and he did not intend to do more
                            by way of covering this obligation, if it were incurred, than to give
                            five or ten year bonds carrying 4% interest.</p>
                        <p>My final comment on the above would be, first that I do not consider that
                            Leger’s argument that a settlement of this nature would not constitute
                            an admission of the claim of principle that the 1910 bonds are payable
                            in gold, is at all convincing; and, secondly, that Léger’s <pb n="566"
                                xml:id="pg_566" facs="0576"/>other argument stops far short of its
                            logical conclusion: i. e., if the French, after very categorically
                            stating that they would not, have proceeded with negotiations for a
                            commercial treaty without the Haitians taking any steps whatsoever
                            towards settling the 1910 claim, it seems clearly to mean that the
                            French made their bluff and it was called, and that therefore all the
                            Haitians have to do is sit tight in confident expectation that the
                            French will not be likely to venture the same bluff a second time. I
                            understand that the 1910 bonds continue to come in steadily so that in
                            the near future those still outstanding and represented by active
                            claimants of gold payment will total a relatively small amount. M. Léger
                            of course is equally aware of this, so that it would appear that he is
                            prepared to give away something for nothing—at least as far as the
                            Haitian Government is concerned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 482 of
                            April 29, dealing with Franco-Haitian commercial relations, I have the
                            honor to report that during a call on the Foreign Minister this morning
                            I asked him how the treaty negotiations were coming along and he said
                            that whereas the last time he had spoken to me he did not think a treaty
                            could be signed until towards the end of August, things had developed
                            quicker than he had anticipated, and he now expects to sign up sometime
                            in June. In fact he said that he and the French Minister had already
                            drafted a treaty and had sent it to Paris for approval.</p>
                        <p>I then asked him if he still felt like giving away some money
                            unnecessarily on the 1910 loan claim. Léger said he did not think it was
                            entirely unnecessarily, to which I replied that when I last spoke to him
                            I understood him to say he had made no commitments. Léger said that was
                            true in that he had agreed to nothing on paper and that he had only told
                            the French that if he did settle the claim it would only be on the basis
                            mentioned in my despatch under reference. Leger said that the French
                            were still saying that such a basis was unsatisfactory, but that they
                            had by no means given up the idea of trying to get something out of this
                            claim; only yesterday, he said, in haggling over the price of jute
                            coffee sacks which the Haitians will agree to buy under the new treaty
                            (as they did in the former treaty), <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567"
                                facs="0577"/>the French had advanced as a counter-proposition to one
                            of Leger’s propositions that the Haitians should agree to pay one
                            thousand francs a bond for all bonds still outstanding.</p>
                        <p>Léger said that while he still would tell me that technically the signing
                            of the treaty and a settlement of the 1910 claim were not linked up, and
                            while, as stated in the preceding paragraph, the French still declared
                            that they would not accept what Leger said would be the only possible
                            basis for settlement, nevertheless he had given the French every reason
                            to think that they could have a settlement on his basis when they wanted
                            it, and he had to admit that he was at least under a moral obligation to
                            make a settlement of that kind. So much so, he added, that if he were
                            now to tell the French that he would not settle on any basis he was sure
                            they would refuse to sign a commercial treaty.</p>
                        <p>I asked him if he did not really feel that what had compelled the French
                            to negotiate for the renewal of the trade treaty was their own
                            self-interest and the fact that the Haitians had for the first time in
                            history demonstrated their independence of the French coffee market. In
                            other words did he not believe that the Haitians had called the French
                            bluff and only had to sit tight to avoid giving away something for
                            nothing. Léger had no answer to make except to say that perhaps this was
                            so, but he still felt that he would not get the treaty if he announced a
                            refusal to settle, and he thought he would be acting in bad faith if he
                            succeeded in getting the treaty signed and then turned around and
                            refused to make any settlement of the claim.</p>
                        <p>I said that perhaps I was being more Catholic than the Pope, but that as
                            long as the Haitians had spent the interest fund, whose equivalent Léger
                            was prepared to pay out in 4% bonds, it irked me to see the Haitian
                            Government taking this amount out of its treasury when there is no
                            necessity to do so. I recalled to him that under the Agreement of August
                            7, 1933,<note n="65" xml:id="d569fn65"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_755"

                                        rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, p. 755</ref>.</note> we had an
                            interest in such a proposed increase of the public debt. Léger said that
                            he realized that, but that he had not supposed that our Government would
                            object to an issue of bonds of this nature. He said that if there was
                            any chance of our Government objecting he hoped that the question might
                            be examined at its earliest convenience, and that the Legation would
                            inform him of our Government’s attitude so that he would know just where
                            he stood. I told him that I would be glad to take the matter up when I
                            arrived in the Department next week, and he said he would be grateful if
                            I would do so.</p>

                            only today received from the Fiscal Representative’s Office copies of
                            correspondence which has recently taken place with regard to a case in
                            Paris in which one, Moulin, appointed a sequestrator by a French court
                            has been directed by that court to present five hundred 1910 Haitian
                            bonds to the Banque de I’Union Parisienne for redemption in depreciated
                            francs under a reserve that a future claim may be lodged for the
                            difference between that value and the value of the bonds on a gold

                        <p>The Government of the United States has learned that the Haitian
                            Government has under serious consideration the offer of a further
                            settlement of certain alleged claims advanced by the holders of the
                            outstanding bonds of the 1910 Haitian loan, in addition to the just and
                            equitable payment offered to all bondholders of this loan at the time

                        <p>It will be recalled that the Haitian Government has for many years
                            consistently maintained that the 1910 loan contract and the bonds
                            themselves did not stipulate payment in “gold” French francs, and that
                            in the phrase “Haitian 5 percent gold loan of 1910” the word “gold”
                            merely referred to the security for the loan which was stipulated in the
                            contracts and the bonds as based upon the collection of one dollar
                            United States gold for every 100 pounds of exported coffee and fifteen
                            percent special surtax in United States gold on the imports created by
                            the law of August 20, 1909.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States on its part has likewise consistently
                            sustained the Haitian position that the service of the 1910 loan was not
                            payable in gold francs, and as the Haitian Government is well aware, the
                            Government of the United States has on numerous occasions in the past,

                            good offices to the Haitian Government, when requested so to do by the
                            Haitian Government, in making representations to the French Government
                            on behalf of this position.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government will recall that in 1922 the United States
                            underwriters of the loan to Haiti issued that year stipulated as a
                            condition precedent to underwriting the loan that all outstanding
                            Haitian loans should be retired. More specifically, the bankers stated
                            that they could not approve the new loan unless they received assurances
                            that the lien of the bonds of the 1910 loan upon Haitian revenues would
                            be discharged by their call for redemption by the Haitian Government <pb
                                n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0580"/>and the tender of the amount of
                            the principal and interest thereof in French francs then in ordinary use
                            and circulation. These assurances were given by the Department of State
                            after consultation with the Haitian Government on November 22, 1922.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is unaware of any subsequent
                            developments in law or equity which would warrant an alteration of the
                            attitude of the Haitian Government or of this Government towards the
                            settlement of the 1910 loan. The Government of the United States is
                            reluctant to believe, therefore, that the Haitian Government should so
                            completely reverse its consistently maintained policy as now to be
                            considering a further settlement with the intransigent holders of the
                            outstanding bonds of the 1910 loan.</p>
                        <p>If the Haitian Government inclines to the view that a settlement on the
                            outstanding bonds might create good will in French official and
                            financial circles, it may be pointed out that the former holders of the
                            bonds of the 1910 loan who accepted in good faith the just and equitable
                            settlement offered them, would appear to have as good a right in equity
                            to an additional settlement as have the holders of the outstanding
                            bonds. It seems probable that far from disposing of the 1910 loan
                            question the offer of a settlement when made, may cause a renewal of
                            agitation in France for a settlement of the entire loan, and thus
                            nullify any good will engendered by the restricted offer of payment.</p>
                        <p>It seems scarcely necessary to remind the Haitian Government that French
                            investors who hold obligations of many other loans, including the Dawes
                            and Young loans<note n="71" xml:id="d571fn71">For the Dawes Plan, see

                            various international issues floated under the auspices of the League of
                            Nations, whose contracts provide for payment in “gold” of a fixed weight
                            and fineness, have accepted payment in depreciated paper francs.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States wishes to remind the Haitian
                            Government that while the 1910 contract and bonds did not contain any
                            clause stipulating payment in gold, the 1922 loan contracts and bonds
                            all contained very carefully worded gold clauses. Notwithstanding these
                            last-named carefully worded “gold” clauses, the service of the 1922
                            loans both as respects interest and amortization has, following the
                            devaluation of the dollar in 1933, been fulfilled in devalued dollars.
                            The United States Government has in existing circumstances no intention
                            of supporting any claim on the part of its citizens for service either
                            as to interest or amortization of the 1922 bonds in United States
                            dollars of the weight and fineness specified <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571"
                                facs="0581"/>at the time that the 1922 loan contracts were made
                            valid. Moreover, it does not appear that so far the bondholders of the
                            1922 loan have seriously questioned the action of the Haitian Government
                            in maintaining the service of the loan by payments in the present United
                            States dollar.</p>
                        <p>It will be obvious to the Haitian Government, however, should a special
                            further settlement be offered to the holders of the outstanding bonds of
                            the 1910 loan, and no corresponding additional settlement be offered to
                            holders of the bonds of the Haitian 1922 issue, that the charge of
                            discrimination in favor of the holders of the French loan probably would
                            be raised by the holders of the bonds of the 1922 loan.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that during my
                            visit to the Foreign Office yesterday, when another matter was
                            discussed, Minister Léger took occasion to raise the question of the
                            1910 bonds. He said he had just received the Department’s memorandum on
                            this subject from M. Lescot.<note n="72" xml:id="d572fn72">Elie Lescot,
                                Haitian Minister in the United States.</note> Since I had not yet
                            received a copy of this memorandum, M. Léger permitted me to read the
                            original he had received.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then said that he wished to discuss this question somewhat
                            at length, and that he would instruct Lescot what reply should be made.
                            Meanwhile he wished to tell me frankly what his views are. He said that
                            when he assumed office last October the question of the disposal of the
                            1936 coffee crop was of pressing importance. He for one was rather
                            pessimistic as to the possibility of selling enough Haitian coffee in
                            the United States to compensate for the loss of the French market
                            following the renunciation of the French commercial convention. Four
                            days after he had taken office he had had a long conversation with
                            Minister Gordon on this subject (see Legation’s telegram No. 46, October
                            27, 1 p.m., 1936<note n="73" xml:id="d572fn73"><ref

                                    680</ref>.</note>) and he had asked the Minister what he thought
                            the Department could do to aid Haiti vis-à-vis the French. Mr. Gordon,
                            he said, had referred this inquiry to the Department, and that after
                            several days the reply had come <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0582"
                            />back that the Department felt that it had done just about all it could
                            in this direction at that time.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">M. Léger then went on to say that he understood at this
                            time that Haiti would have to tackle this problem unassisted by
                            Washington. He felt then as he does now that the French bondholders have
                            no legal claim against Haiti, and neither then nor now does he have any
                            sentimental or other reason which would influence him to pay them one
                            franc. Money was too hard to come by these days.</p>
                        <p>But he did as Foreign Minister have to find ways and means of disposing
                            of Haiti’s coffee crop, and in looking around for some way to appease
                            the French it occurred to him that something more than $500,000 had been
                            received by the Haitian Government as interest on the money which the
                            French bondholders had declined to accept in depreciated francs. Since
                            the American Government felt unable to assist him, could he not find a
                            way to appease the French by a token payment of this interest amounting
                            to about $500,000 or in terms of francs, Frs. 10,000,000? It was true
                            that this money was not available in cash to the Haitian Government
                            since this interest had been currently considered an ordinary revenue of
                            the Government and only a small amount remained available. His idea,
                            therefore, providing the French were found to be receptive, was to issue
                            bonds for this amount bearing 4% interest and payable in 15 years which
                            might be turned over to the French Government for distribution as it saw
                            fit.</p>
                        <p>In order not to compromise himself with the French, he determined to
                            sound out the French Minister through the intermediary of M. Lespinasse,
                            President of the French Chamber of Commerce in Port-au-Prince. He asked
                            M. Lespinasse to find an occasion to talk with M. de Lens, French
                            Minister to Haiti, and incidentally and casually to inquire whether the
                            Minister thought that Frs. 10,000,000 payable in 15 years would satisfy
                            the bondholders of the French Government and thus put an end to this
                            thorny question. The French Minister, acting upon this inquiry, referred
                            the matter to his Government but received no reply thereto.</p>
                        <p>In due course, however, M. de Lens was authorized by his Government to
                            open new negotiations for a commercial convention. Nothing was said as
                            these negotiations proceeded with regard to the Frs. 10,000,000
                            settlement, and he, M. Léger, took this to mean that for all <pb n="573"
                                xml:id="pg_573" facs="0583"/>practical purposes the French had
                            accepted this indirect offer and so he went on to conclude the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> and later to draft the new
                            commercial convention. The latter is now practically in its final form
                            and ready for signature.</p>
                        <p>However, when it came time to sign the convention, the French Government
                            proposed that this conclusion be accompanied by a settlement of the 1910
                            question on the basis of Frs. 1,000, per bond or approximately Frs.
                            20,000,000 in all. This was double what the Minister had offered
                            indirectly. M. Léger said that he called in M. de Lens and told him in
                            so many words that his Government could “<hi rend="italic">aller au
                                diable</hi>”; if he decided to give them anything he would not give
                            them one franc more than Frs. 10,000,000. There the matter apparently
                            rests and the French are showing no haste in concluding the convention.
                            The French Commercial Attaché has left for other parts and the French
                            Minister to Haiti has retired to Kenscoff.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Léger said that the 1937 coffee crop bids fair to be a large
                            one. While American purchases of Haiti’s coffee continue to be
                            satisfactory, they are not yet large enough to warrant the belief that
                            Haiti can dispense with the French market during the coming season.
                            Moreover, it appears that the prices paid for Haitian coffee in the
                            French market are somewhat greater than those paid in the United States.
                            He therefore feels he must have this convention concluded as soon as
                            possible. At this point the Foreign Minister again pointed out that he
                            had never admitted the legality of the French claim against Haiti; that
                            Haiti had no legal obligation to pay them anything; and he did not want
                            to pay them anything. In order to settle the perennial difficulty,
                            however, he had told them indirectly that he might be willing to settle
                            for Frs. 10,000,000 if that would put an end to the matter; accordingly,
                            if the French signed the commercial convention, he would feel morally
                            bound to pay this sum. In no case would he pay them more.</p>
                        <p>M. Léger then asked me to put these views before my Government and
                            inquire whether the Department now felt that it could use its good
                            offices with the French Government to help Haiti obtain its objective in
                            the French coffee market. He pointed out that the Haitian Government
                            could not increase its public debt without the approval of the United
                            States; also that this question of the 1910 bonds had had its origin
                            during our Occupation and he felt that Haiti ought to receive our help
                            in lifting this iron from the fire. He said in terminating the
                            conversation that he intends to call in M. de Lens and let him read the
                            Department’s memorandum.</p>
                        <p>I told M. Léger that I had already reported the attitude of the Haitian
                            Government on this subject in so far as he had made it clear to me, and
                            that I would again be glad upon his request to amplify what had already
                            been sent to the Department.</p>
                        <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0584"/>
                        <p>In order to give the Department a clear picture of the present status of
                            the 1910 bond account in New York, I have asked the Assistant Fiscal
                                Representative<note n="75" xml:id="d572fn75">Rex A. Pixley.</note>
                            to give me an inclusive memorandum which he has promised to do next
                            week. Meanwhile, I enclose a statement<note n="76" xml:id="d572fn76">Not
                                printed.</note> showing the rate at which these bonds have been
                            redeemed from January, 1935 through April 1937.</p>
                        <p>During our conversation yesterday M. Leger expressed himself as being
                            angry with Bogdan<note n="77" xml:id="d572fn77">Norbert A. Bogdan, Vice
                                President of the J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation.</note> and
                            his associates in Paris for having entered into any discussion with the
                            French Bondholders Council regarding this question. He said that Bogdan
                            had no authorization from the Haitian Government to do this, and that
                            experience has shown in the past that the 1910 bonds are redeemed at a
                            relatively slower rate following any such hair-brained discussion as may
                            have gone on in Paris this summer.</p>

                            June 22.</p>
                        <p>Confidentially, the Minister expressed to me the hope that the good
                            offices of the United States might once more be exercised in behalf of
                            Haiti with the Government of France in order that the French Government
                            would give Haiti direct assurances that no obstacle would be placed in
                            the way of Haiti selling to France that portion of her coffee crop which
                            she cannot market in the United States and which customarily is
                            purchased by French importers and, second, that the French Government
                            would likewise agree to regard as liquidated this long standing
                            controversy over the 1910 bond payments.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he thought the arrangement which was now being
                            discussed between Haiti and France with regard to some compensation to
                            the holders of the 1910 bonds was in the highest degree prejudicial to
                            Haiti and would only open the door to further attempts on the part of
                            the French bondholders for additional compensation in the future and was
                            entirely unnecessary and required neither in law nor in equity.</p>
                        <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0585"/>
                        <p>I told the Minister that we would be very glad once more informally to
                            approach the French Government with a view to utilizing our good offices
                            in behalf of Haiti but that of course I could give him no assurance at
                            all that these steps would meet with any success.</p>

                        <p>In reply to the Memorandum of June 22nd last, relative to the claim of
                            the holders of the 1910 loan, the Haitian Government is happy to be able
                            to dissipate the uneasiness which the United States Government appears
                            to feel with respect to its attitude towards the claim of the said
                            holders.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the Haitian Government is not conducting any negotiations with
                            France that would imply the abandonment of the thesis which the Republic
                            of Haiti, in full accord on this point with the Government of the United
                            States, has always firmly maintained, that is, that the loan contract of
                            1910 does not involve any obligation to repay anything but paper
                            francs.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government is just as much aware as the United States
                            Government of the danger there would be in acknowledging the principle
                            of a debt in gold francs, and it does not hesitate to give formal
                            assurance that it will never acknowledge such an obligation against
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government has been good enough to recall the good
                            offices it has rendered the Haitian Government in the past, in the
                            controversies on that subject that have existed. The Haitian Government
                            highly appreciates this friendly attitude of the United States
                            Government, and it does not fail to recognize either the scope of the
                            assurances given the bankers who financed the 1922 loan. However,
                            despite those good offices, it is undeniable that a serious controversy
                            exists between the French Government and the Haitian Government
                            concerning the 1910 loan. This controversy has had the consequence of
                            leading France to denounce the treaty of commerce which bound her with
                            the Republic of Haiti, which has provoked, as a measure of reprisal, the
                            application of the maximum Haitian customs tariff to French goods and
                            has resulted, in fact, in the almost complete breaking off of trade
                            relations between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government believes it should emphasize that the normal flow
                            of the coffee crop is at the basis of the economic and <pb n="576"
                                xml:id="pg_576" facs="0586"/>fiscal life of the Republic of Haiti.
                            Great efforts, crowned with a certain amount of success, have been made
                            to introduce Haitian coffee into the United States market. It is the
                            intention of the Haitian Government to continue these efforts and to
                            neglect nothing, in order to win an advantageous position for the
                            Haitian product in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, despite the efforts just spoken of, the United States
                            market absorbed only the quantity of about fifty thousand sacks of
                            Haitian coffee during the crop year 1936–1937 and at prices which, on
                            the whole, have been a little below those given by Havre. On the other
                            hand, despite the denouncement of the Franco-Haitian Convention, Havre
                            was the largest purchaser of Haitian coffee during the last crop year.
                            Such purchases have doubtless been made because of the hope which the
                            trade of Havre had that a prompt solution would be found for the
                            difficulties between France and Haiti. Those hopes have not been
                            realized. The result is that a large part of the coffee purchased during
                            the last crop year is still in stock in Havre warehouses. It is certain
                            that if no agreement is reached the Republic of Haiti cannot count on
                            purchases by Havre for the coming crop year and, consequently, that the
                            Republic of Haiti will run the twofold risk of being unable, on the one
                            hand, to count on the Havre market for the 1937–1938 crop year and, on
                            the other hand, of seeing its French customers form the fixed habit of
                            buying coffees of other origin.</p>
                        <p>For another thing, it is reported that the 1937–1938 crop is to be
                            unusually large. But nothing indicates that the United States market
                            will absorb the coffee coming from the new crop in a larger amount than
                            last year. There is also to be pointed out the considerable drop in
                            profit that would result for the Haitian trade by the loss of the French
                            market; in fact, while New York generally pays only the Santos price, or
                            a price even below Santos, for Haitian coffee, the Havre market has, on
                            the contrary, always given Haitian coffee a premium over Santos.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government believes that the United States Government will
                            agree that the circumstances just pointed out constitute a <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> situation which amply justifies the
                            efforts it believes it must make to put an end to the difficulties with
                            France.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government will likewise consider that it is not
                            possible for the Haitian Government, responsible to the Haitian people
                            for the management of its affairs, to remain indifferent to the danger
                            which menaces the general Haitian economy. The Haitian Government found
                            itself under all the greater obligation to seek for a solution, in that
                            it had been informed in October 1936 by the United States Minister at
                            Port-au-Prince that his Government did not think <pb n="577"
                                xml:id="pg_577" facs="0587"/>that it was possible for it to make any
                            new effort, for the time being, to aid in settling the 1910 matter.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations have therefore been conducted with the French Government.
                            These negotiations have not yet led to any definitive arrangement. The
                            basis considered does not impair in any way the juridical position
                            assumed in the past and which the Republic of Haiti continues to assume.
                            The Haitian Government has taken into consideration the fact that from
                            the approximately 25,000,000 frs. representing the sum of the 1910
                            obligations not presented for payment, it has, from 1923 to this date,
                            received interest exceeding the amount of $500,000. The Haitian
                            Government thinks that it might agree to pay to the holders of the 1910
                                [loan],<note n="79" xml:id="d574fn79">Brackets here and elsewhere in
                                this document appear in the file translation.</note> through the
                            French Government, a sum representing nearly the total of that interest.
                            In order to avoid any embarrassment to the Treasury of the Republic of
                            Haiti, the payment of 10,000,000.00 francs has been envisaged (which, at
                            the current rate, represents a little less than the $500,000 collected),
                            by means of an emission of obligations payable in fifteen years and
                            bearing 4 percent interest. The Haitian Government wishes to dwell upon
                            the fact that such an arrangement, if concluded, would not impair in any
                            way its juridical position with respect to repayment in paper francs,
                            would only return to the holders of the 1910 [obligations] money which
                            the Haitian Government would never have received if the bonds had been
                            presented for redemption and, if the terms are considered, would
                            constitute a very slight burden on the Republic of Haiti, particularly
                            in view of the advantages the national economy derives from the Havre
                            market. The drop in profits which would result from the loss of the
                            Havre market for as large a crop as that which may be expected for
                            1937–1938, would probably exceed for that one year the total amount of
                            the compensation to be given the holders of 1910 [obligations].</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Haitian Government can hardly see in what way such an
                            arrangement could injure the rights of the holders of the 1922 loan. The
                            Haitian Government highly appreciates the assurance that the United
                            States Government has just been good enough to give it, that it does not
                            intend to support any claim that its citizens might make on the occasion
                            of the payment of the 1922 loan in devalued dollars. It notes with
                            satisfaction that it does not seem that the holders of 1922
                            [obligations] are thinking of calling in question the Haitian
                            Government’s absolute right to effect the payment in this way.</p>
                        <p>By reason of this assurance which the United States Government has been
                            good enough to give it, the Haitian Government does not believe it
                            necessary to set forth the reasons which, in its opinion, <pb n="578"
                                xml:id="pg_578" facs="0588"/>would render such a claim of the holder
                            of 1922 [bonds] hard to maintain. It desires to lay emphasis on the fact
                            that the arrangement with the French Government that is envisaged would,
                            assuming that it is made, constitute neither favored treatment of the
                            holders of 1910 [bonds] nor an act of discrimination against the holders
                            of 1922 [bonds]. The arrangement contemplated would only permit holders
                            of 1910 [bonds] who have not been paid yet to recover a part of the
                            interest on the funds that were deposited in order to be paid to them.
                            The question of determining whether in law, such interest does not
                            belong to such holders is evidently a question that may give rise to
                            controversy, but it is certain that as a matter of equity the holders of
                            1910 [bonds] have grounds for cleaning such interest. Hence it appears
                            that such an arrangement would not give them any privileged treatment of
                            such a nature as to disturb the susceptibilities of the holders of the
                            1922 loan.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government wishes to add that the agreement contemplated
                            would definitively put an end to all controversies between France and
                            Haiti with regard to the 1910 loan.</p>

                        <p>28. Following a brief conversation with Welles concerning the insistance
                            by France upon a settlement of the 1910 loan claim as a condition of the
                            negotiation of a commercial convention, Henry<note n="80"
                                xml:id="d575fn80">Jules Henry, French Minister in the United
                                States.</note> telegraphed the Foreign Office for information.
                            Yesterday he told Duggan that the Foreign Office had replied that it has
                            offered to settle the 1910 loan claim on the basis of 1000 paper francs,
                            apparently of present value, for each outstanding bond. Henry endeavored
                            to argue that since the franc had undergone further depreciation
                            recently the amount which Haiti would have to pay under the proposed
                            settlement has actually decreased.</p>
                        <p>Duggan again spoke to Henry along the usual lines, namely, an expression
                            of the interest of this Government in Haiti’s obtaining a satisfactory
                            quota in the French coffee market, and of concern with France’s linking
                            settlement of the 1910 loan claim with the negotiation of a commercial
                            convention. Henry said that he would communicate once again our views to
                            his Government.</p>
                        <p>You are authorized in your discretion to communicate the above to the
                            Minister for Foreign Relations. At the same time you may say <pb n="579"
                                xml:id="pg_579" facs="0589"/>that the Government is at a loss to
                            understand how Mr. Leger could have received the impression last fall
                            that this Government was unprepared to continue extending its good
                            offices in behalf of Haiti with respect to its attitude on the 1910 loan
                            vis-à-vis France. You may refer to the contents of the Department’s
                            telegram No. 24 of October 28, 1936, 7 p.m.,<note n="81"

                                        >v</hi>, p. 681</ref>.</note> which was communicated by you
                            to Mr. Leger. You may say that since no further information was
                            forthcoming from the Haitian Government as to the nature of the demands
                            which France had made in connection with a new commercial agreement with
                            Haiti, and since there was no indication that these demands were “unduly
                            exigent or unreasonable” the Department consequently at that time was
                            unaware of any reasons which would induce it to take further action on
                            Haiti’s behalf with respect to France.</p>
                        <p>Duggan saw Lescot today and informed him of the nature of his
                            conversation with Henry.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy at Paris is being instructed to reinforce the views expressed
                            to Henry directly to the Foreign Office.</p>

                        <p>44. Department’s 28, July 13, 7 p.m. I had a long interview with Foreign
                            Minister this morning and communicated to him the views contained in the
                            Department’s telegram under reference. I not only reread to him the
                            contents of the Department’s 24, October 28, 7 p.m. 1936<note n="81"
                                xml:id="d576fn81"><ref target="frus1936v05#pg_681"><hi rend="italic"

                                        >v</hi>, p. 681</ref>.</note> but also recalled to him that
                            on March 16 last (see my despatch No. 447 of that date<note n="82"
                                xml:id="d576fn82">Not printed.</note>) I had reminded him of his
                            inquiry concerning the Department’s disposition to assist Haiti and the
                            Department’s above-mentioned reply thereto.</p>
                        <p>I informed Leger that in response to the renewed request recently made by
                            the Haitian Government the Department of State had been glad again to
                            exercise its good offices vis-à-vis the French Government both as
                            regards a coffee quota and the 1910 loan.</p>
                        <p>I suggested to the Foreign Minister that if he would show a disposition
                            to refrain from making a compromise payment to the French it would in my
                            opinion help the situation with respect to our representations to the
                            French Government. In particular I suggested that as the French on the
                            very eve of signing the commercial treaty had <pb n="580"
                                xml:id="pg_580" facs="0590"/>refused to do so on the sole ground of
                            this 1910 claim, if Leger could even assure me that in consequence
                            thereof he now no longer felt even morally bound to pay the French the
                            10 million francs which he had once proposed (see Legation’s despatches
                            numbers 498 of June 1 and 511 of June 26) it would help.</p>
                        <p>Leger replied that he could not give me an assurance of this importance
                            without first consulting the President but that he would consult the
                            latter (who is at Kenscoff) tomorrow morning and would give me a
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>Leger professes to be unable to get away from the dilemma that if our
                            representations to the French have no effect the Haitian Government will
                            have to pay some amount of “blackmail” (Leger’s word) in order to avoid
                            a heavier loss through the closing of the French coffee market.</p>
                        <p>I told Leger that I noted with regret that he was disposed to discard the
                            reasoning contained in the Memorandum<note n="84" xml:id="d576fn84"><hi

                            June 22) concerning potential claims on the part of 1910 bondholders who
                            accepted payment in paper francs and of 1922 bondholders on the ground
                            of discrimination. Leger replied that he did not think these
                            possibilities were seriously dangerous whereas the eventuality of not
                            being able to dispose of this year’s coffee crop on account of losing
                            the French Market was.</p>
                        <p>Leger repeatedly stated that he greatly regretted having misunderstood
                            the Department’s position as set forth in its 24, October 28, 7 p.m.,
                            and that when I reread it to him this morning he could see plainly that
                            far from expressing any unreadiness to continue extending our good
                            offices in behalf of Haiti it made clear our inclination to do so upon
                            due cause therefor being shown; he only hoped that his misunderstanding
                            had done no harm.</p>
                        <p>I shall cable further tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>47. My 44, July 15, 1 p.m. Leger excused himself for not having seen me
                            yesterday saying that he had returned too late from Kenscoff. However, I
                            have this morning had long conversations with him and with the President
                            the net result of which as regards the 1910 claim is as follows:</p>
                        <p>Leger will see the French Minister tomorrow or Monday and, referring to
                            the 10,000,000 francs proposition informally made to the <pb n="581"
                                xml:id="pg_581" facs="0591"/>French Government, tell him that if the
                            French Government now agrees to such settlement Leger is prepared to go
                            through with it as far as the Haitian Government is concerned. Leger
                            will again say categorically to the French Minister that under the terms
                            of the 1933 agreement such settlement cannot be consummated unless the
                            agreement of the American Government is secured.</p>
                        <p>If the French Minister is not prepared to agree and does not secure his
                            Government’s agreement by cable within a week at most Leger will
                            formally tell him that the Haitian Government resumes its full liberty
                            of action concerning the 1910 claim and no longer considers itself even
                            morally bound by any informal propositions heretofore made.</p>

                            President upon my forthcoming arrival in the Department.</p>

                        <p>50. Legation’s 47 of July 17, 1 p.m. Leger sent for me this morning in
                            accordance with his promise and said that he had heard nothing from the
                            French Government except the report of his Minister in Paris to the
                            effect that France would not sign a commercial convention with Haiti
                            except on the basis of a payment of 1000 francs per bond to the 1910
                            holders. Inasmuch as a week had elapsed since his last conversation with
                            the French Minister here he no longer considers himself bound, even
                            morally, to pay the French holders the 10,000,000 francs he had
                            informally offered them. He has not yet, however, had an opportunity to
                            inform Monsieur de Lens of his decision owing to the reluctance of the
                            latter to come down from Kenscoff. He has not sent for him formally and
                            expects to inform him tomorrow. Meanwhile, he said I might inform my
                            Government. He will let me know as soon as this conversation has taken
                            place.</p>

                            talked with the French Minister to Haiti on July 28 and had told him
                            that he no longer feels bound, even morally, to pay the French 1910
                            bondholders the 10 million francs he had tentatively offered them as a
                            settlement. Monsieur de Lens begged Leger, the latter said, to hold the
                            question open until he could obtain additional instructions from his
                            Government. The Foreign Minister stated that he replied that while he
                            would always be willing to listen to what the French Government wished
                            to say, the Haitian Government had recovered entire freedom of action in
                            this matter. De la Rue<note n="89" xml:id="d581fn89">Sidney de la Rue,
                                Fiscal Representative.</note> states that Leger made the same
                            assertions to him.</p>
                        <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0593"/>
                        <p>Leger again expressed his appreciation of the efforts that are being made
                            by our Embassy at Paris and said that he was more optimistic since
                            Duggan had told Lescot that Delbos expected to go personally into the
                            Haitian question.</p>

                                printed.</note> Leger has informed me that the purpose of the French
                            Minister’s visit to the Foreign Office this morning was to propose a new
                            examination by them of two or three minor points in the draft of the
                            Franco-Haitian commercial convention. Leger told De Lens that while he
                            was quite willing to discuss any of these points he felt it would be a
                            waste of time to do so unless France was now seriously interested in
                            concluding the convention. Leger said he was unable to decide from what
                            De Lens said whether this new proposal can or cannot be taken as an
                            indication that the French Government is disposed to divorce the 1910
                            question from that of the commercial convention. He naturally hopes so.
                            In any case he said he repeated very emphatically to De Lens, in order
                            that there could be no mistake, that he had resumed complete liberty of
                            action in the 1910 matter and that he did not feel bound, even morally,
                            to pay the French bondholders anything.</p>

                            He recalled to Cochran the difficulties <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584"
                                facs="0594"/>which had been experienced in the past through the

                            Haitian officials. He said he could make no reply immediately since
                            further information would have to be sought from Haiti and various
                            French experts consulted.</p>

                            provisional trade arrangement with Haiti which expires August 31.</p>

                                footnote 91, <ref target="#pg_583">p. 583</ref>.</note> I read Leger
                            most of the Department’s telegram. He reaffirmed that the French
                            Government could be under no possible misapprehension as to his position
                            in the 1910 matter. He had several times repeated his declaration to the
                            French Minister here that he no longer feels bound even morally to pay
                            the French bondholders anything. De Lens assured him that he had
                            transmitted this information to his Government. To make certain that it
                            reached Paris correctly he had asked his Minister there to say the same
                            at the Foreign Office and he had done so.</p>
                        <p>The Legation has considerable ground for believing that De Lens may have
                            understated Leger’s declaration to his Government. De Lens expects to
                            leave Haiti in the near future and has expressed anxiety to Leger that
                            his career may be prejudiced unless he can show some tangible success in
                            these negotiations.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>,<note n="97"

                                5293.</note> Leger said that neither Haiti nor France had materially
                            benefitted by this arrangement. The minimum tariff rates which had been
                            accorded French specialties such as wine were still too high greatly to
                            increase the volume of imports. Moreover, the temporary nature of the
                            agreement had naturally prevented any “futures” market for Haitian
                            coffee in France.</p>
                        <p>Leger said he personally was not in favor of raising duties on French
                            imports to the maximum level upon the expiration of the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus</hi>

                            However he expected to inform De Lens that the Haitian Government is
                            seriously considering this step unless the French quota for Haitian
                            coffee can be materially increased by prolonging the arrangement. He
                            said that he considered 30,000 or 40,000 bags wholly inadequate. He
                            wanted to see how the French would react to this.</p>

                            Haitian Minister or its Minister in Port-au-Prince, of any withdrawal of
                            the Haitian Government’s offer of $500,000 to holders of the 1910 bonds
                            in exchange for signature of the Trade Convention. You may say that this
                            Government will be glad to continue to support Haiti’s opposition to
                            making this unjustifiable payment on the 1910 loan but cannot do so
                            unless it is thoroughly informed as to the line the Haitian Government
                            is pursuing and intends to pursue in its negotiations with the French
                            Government.</p>

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Chargé d’affaires</hi>: I desire to confirm
                                in all points the conversation which we have had this morning
                                regarding the attitude of the Haitian Government concerning the
                                non-official propositions which had been envisaged for the
                                settlement of the controversy with France as to the matter of the
                                1910 loan.</p>
                            <p>On July 19 I declared to the French Minister at Port-au-Prince that
                                the Haitian Government could not let the existing situation be
                                prolonged; that we thought that the moment had come for us to
                                determine what were the intentions of the French Government; that as
                                a consequence I asked him to be kind enough to let me know
                                definitely whether his Government accepted or not the non-official
                                proposals envisaged for the settlement of the 1910 matter; and
                                whether they were or were not disposed to sign the treaty of
                                commerce which we had negotiated. I likewise declared to the
                                Minister of France that if his Government did not let me learn of
                                its acceptance of the non-official propositions, the Haitian
                                Government would consider itself divested of all moral obligations
                                with regard to this matter, and would recover its absolute freedom
                                of action with regard to the 1910 controversy.</p>
                            <p>Monsieur de Lens asked for a delay of eight days in order to obtain a
                                reply of his Government to this notification.</p>
                            <p>As a precaution, on July 211 cabled to my Minister at Paris asking
                                him to confirm to the Quai d’Orsay the declarations which I had made
                                to the French Minister at Port-au-Prince. On July 23, Monsieur
                                Chatelain replied by cable that my instructions had been
                                executed.</p>
                            <p>M. de Lens having delayed in letting me know the reply of the French
                                Government, I declared to him, during the course of a new
                                conversation which took place at the end of the month of July, that
                                the Haitian Government had recovered its complete liberty of action
                                and did not consider itself bound in any manner by the non-official
                                proposals previously envisaged. This declaration, which was quite
                                clear, was confirmed during the course of two other conversations
                                which I had with M. de Lens during the first days of August with
                                regard to certain details of the treaty of commerce which was under
                                discussion. No doubt can exist in the mind of M. de Lens as to the
                                attitude of the Haitian Government, and it is equally certain from
                                these conversations that M. de Lens has transmitted to his
                                Government the declaration which I have made to him.</p>
                            <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0597"/>
                            <p>I am therefore able with difficulty to explain the misunderstanding
                                which seems to exist with regard to the position taken by the
                                Haitian Government; I am able to explain still less the declarations
                                which have been made to the American Ambassador by Minister
                                Chatelain and which you were good enough to bring to my attention
                                this morning.</p>
                            <p>To end this inexplicable situation, I have cabled again this morning
                                to the Minister of Haiti at Paris, asking him to dissipate the
                                erroneous impression brought about by the conversation which the
                                American Ambassador had with him on the 11th of August and giving
                                him instructions to confirm, if he judges it necessary, to the Quai
                                d’Orsay the declarations which have already been made by the Haitian
                                Government with regard to the 1910 controversy.</p>
                            <p>Please accept [etc.]</p>

                                printed.</note> Leger sent for me this morning and said that he had
                            received a telegram from Chatelain. The latter reported that he had been
                            advised by the American Ambassador in Paris that Haiti had withdrawn its
                            $500,000 offer but that he, hoping to reserve a certain freedom of
                            action, had given the Ambassador an indefinite reply. Leger said he had
                            again telegraphed Chatelain to make the attitude of the Haitian
                            Government clear to the Ambassador, and pending further instructions, to
                            refrain from further negotiations toward a <hi rend="italic">modus

                        <p>Leger also said that after reflection he was a little afraid that De Lens
                            had not fully reported the Haitian position to his Government.</p>

                        <p>71. Leger sent for me this morning and said that he and the French
                            Minister had now worked out a final draft of a Haitian-French commercial
                            convention and that it could be signed at once if the Minister <pb
                                n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0598"/>received instructions to do so.
                            De Kuli informed him in answer to a direct question that he did not have
                            explicit instructions to proceed with the drafting of the convention but
                            that inasmuch as he expected soon to go on leave he wanted to have the
                            draft worked out and in final form. De la Rue has the draft and is
                            examining it.</p>
                        <p>Leger expressed some anxiety that no recent reports have been received
                            concerning the progress made by our Paris Embassy in the 1910 matter. He
                            asked whether I would be willing to telegraph for a report about this
                            and, incidentally, inquire whether Under Secretary Welles, while he is
                            in Paris, could not by reason of his intimate acquaintance with the
                            subject do something to assist. I said I would inform the Department of
                            his request.</p>
                        <p>Leger then said that for some reason he could not yet understand, his
                            Minister in Paris did not seem to be absolutely clear regarding his
                            Government’s attitude in the 1910 matter. He had received the following
                            telegram from Chatelain on August 28: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>(Translation). “At the request of the American Ambassador I have
                                    promised to remain in contact with him. Yesterday morning I was
                                    called to the Quai d’Orsay where they spoke to me again
                                    regarding your offer and said that devaluation brings us more
                                    and more nearly together and that an agreement could now be
                                    reached on a basis of 840 francs in place of a thousand. They
                                    added that if things looked as though they could be arranged, I
                                    would be sent for again. I deduced from this communication that,
                                    first, the American Government has intervened; second, I would
                                    like to envisage the signature in the near future no longer of a
                                    provisional accord or a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> but
                                    of a definite treaty; third, that the Ambassador approves
                                    principle of the offer following my explanations on this subject
                                    but that the Government is bargaining still to obtain a little
                                    more than 500 francs. I have learned in the course of this
                                    conversation of the approaching arrival of the American Under
                                    Secretary of State and I see in that some connection with the
                                    communication made to me yesterday morning.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Leger instructed Chatelain as follows on August 28: <quote

                                <p>(Translation) “Referring to your cable of August 28, I confirm to
                                    you that the Haitian Government considers itself entirely free
                                    from all engagements relating to the unofficial propositions
                                    previously envisaged. I desire that there shall be no mistake on

                                    subject of any transaction for regulating the 1910 matter. Work

                            he handed me a copy of a telegram dated September 3 which he has
                            received from Chatelain as follows (translation): <quote

                                <p>“I received last evening from the Quai d’Orsay the following
                                    note: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>‘In the course of the negotiations with regard to the

                                            this matter have been envisaged. In order to permit
                                            these negotiations to be usefully pursued, the Minister

                                            what are actually the official propositions which the
                                            Haitian Government desires to present’.</p>

                                <p>“Moreover, the American Embassy told me this noon that a decision
                                    had been made in the morning by the French Government to divorce
                                    the two questions, which decision will be communicated today to
                                    the Minister of France to Haiti in order to get ready the treaty

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Leger remarked that while the French told the Paris Embassy that the two
                            questions had been divorced, they apparently had said nothing of the
                            sort to Chatelain and had even proposed to him simultaneously that the
                            Haitian Government set forth in writing its official proposals for the
                            settlement of the 1910 question. Before instructing Chatelain what to
                            reply, Leger said he would be grateful if the American Ambassador in
                            Paris following his conversation with Delbos could shed any light on
                            this possible dissimulation. De Kuli has not yet seen Leger and the
                            latter is unaware what instructions may have been received by him.</p>

                        <p>75. My 73, September 4, noon. Leger sent for me this morning and said
                            that he had just terminated a conversation with the French <pb n="590"
                                xml:id="pg_590" facs="0600"/>Minister to Haiti. The latter had been
                            instructed by his Government to say that in view of the divorce of the
                            1910 question from that of the commercial convention, conditions had now
                            changed and the French Government was unwilling to proceed with the
                            signature of the convention as it now stands. They are now willing only
                            to take Haitian coffee to a value of twice that of Haitian imports of
                            French products. In effect this would reduce the proposed Haitian coffee
                            quota from 120,000 quintals to about 40,000.</p>
                        <p>Leger said he had been very angry at this further evidence of French
                            pettiness if not duplicity; that the convention as it stands had been
                            negotiated point by point with the approval of the Quai d’Orsay; and
                            that 40,000 quintals is so small a quota as to be practically worthless.
                            He would never go as far as he had in the draft convention for so
                            insignificant a benefit. He then said that he informed De Kuli that he
                            was leaving Haiti for the United States (see my telegram 74, September
                            7, noon<note n="5" xml:id="d590fn5">Not printed.</note>) within 8 or 10
                            days. He was ready and willing to sign the convention as it stands
                            before his departure. If it were so concluded within that period he
                            would see to it that nothing further would be done about it during his
                            absence which might be for 2 or 3 months. De Kuli promised to cable his
                            Government today.</p>

                        <p>45. In his interview with the French Chargé d’Affaires<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d591fn6">Jules Henry.</note> this morning, Mr. Duggan
                            outlined briefly to him the developments of the past 3 weeks as respects
                            the Franco-Haitian Commercial Convention and the 1910 loan. While the
                            precise terms of the proposed Franco-Haitian Commercial Convention, the
                            text of which was forwarded in your despatch no. 548 of September
                                4,<note n="5" xml:id="d591fn5">Not printed.</note> were not
                            discussed, Mr. Duggan alluded to the Haitian disappointment at the
                            proposed reduction in a new Convention of the Haitian coffee quota from
                            120,000 to 40,000 quintals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Henry said that he understood fully the attitude of this Government
                            with respect to Haiti and stated further that Bonnet<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d591fn7">Georges Bonnet, French Ambassador in the United
                                States.</note> on his departure had told Henry that he knew that the
                            French official insistence on the 1910 loan had been “a source of
                            irritation to the American Government” and that he, Bonnet, proposed to
                            take the <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0601"/>matter up strongly
                            with Delbos on his return. Accordingly Henry felt that the decision of
                            the French Government to disassociate the two questions had been to some
                            extent influenced by Bonnet’s representations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Henry expressed some surprise that following the decision to
                            disassociate the two questions the French Government had instructed the
                            Minister in Port au Prince to reduce the coffee quota in a new
                            Convention and inferred that in this case perhaps the subordinate
                            officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were taking action not
                            fully in accord with the decision of Delbos. Henry said that now that he
                            had the facts of the case, he would immediately despatch a strong
                            telegram to Paris. He inquired whether it would be satisfactory to this
                            Government if France should agree to sign the previously negotiated
                            Franco-Haitian Commercial Convention. Mr. Duggan stated that that
                            Convention apparently was satisfactory to Haiti and therefore would in
                            general fulfill our interest in this matter, although he was not in a
                            position to give an opinion as to this Government’s attitude with
                            respect to the other terms of that Convention.</p>
                        <p>The Department has made a cursory examination of the trade clauses
                            contained in the proposed Franco-Haitian Convention forwarded under your
                            despatch no. 548. At an early opportunity you should inform the Foreign
                            Minister that while this Government reserves the right to comment on
                            certain provisions of this treaty as they may affect Haitian-American
                            trade, this Government fully expects that in accordance with the
                            Haitian-American trade agreement of March 28, 1935,<note n="8"

                        <p>79. Leger sent for me this morning following a conversation which he had
                            had with the French Minister to Haiti. De Kuli acting evidently <pb
                                n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0602"/>upon instructions from Paris,
                            presented the Haitian Government with an <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> substantially repeating what he had told Leger
                            verbally September 4 (see my telegram 73, September 4, noon). In it the
                            French Government states definitely that the 1910 question has been
                            divorced from that of a new trade convention, and then proceeds to state
                            that, in view of the changed conditions, the convention “will have to be
                            made over again”. The offer of a quota of 40,000 quintals per annum
                            remains and a small additional quota would be made available for any
                            month following one wherein French imports into Haiti had exceeded
                            800,000 francs. Leger informed de Kuli that this proposal was entirely
                            unsatisfactory to the Haitian Government, that he would not consider it
                            and that unless France bought enough Haitian coffee to make the business
                            advantageous for Haiti he would recommend the reimposition of the
                            maximum tariff on French goods.</p>
                        <p>Leger said he was very much annoyed at this intransigent attitude of the
                            French and that he feared that Labonne<note n="10" xml:id="d592fn10"
                                >Eirik-Pierre Labonne, Adjunct Director of Political and Commercial
                                Affairs, French Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</note> was again
                            directing Haitian matters at the Quai d’Orsay.</p>
                        <p>I told Leger the substance of the conversations had by the Department
                            with Henry. He again expressed his warm appreciation of the steps the
                            American Government had taken to aid his country and said that he was
                            instructing Lescot who was returning to Washington shortly to tender
                            this Government’s thanks to the Department. If eventually a satisfactory
                            convention could be concluded with the French Government it would be
                            only because of our assistance.</p>

                        <p>89. President Vincent informs me that the French Minister acting
                            apparently without instructions has suggested that the impasse in
                            negotiations for a Franco-Haitian commercial treaty could probably be
                            overcome by a renewal of the Haitian offer to pay the French $500,000 on
                            account of the 1910 question. He states that he told the Minister that
                            the two questions had been divorced. I said that while Monsieur Delbos
                            had apparently been unable to discuss the Haitian question lately with
                            our Embassy at Paris my unofficial information was that we were not at
                            all convinced that an impasse had been reached <pb n="593"
                                xml:id="pg_593" facs="0603"/>and I begged him not to reconsider any
                            payment or reunion of the two questions.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that the French Minister had come to offer him
                            the Grand Cross of the Legion. He said he told the Minister that its
                            presentation ought to be delayed until a satisfactory solution could be
                            found to the commercial question.</p>

                            this unwarranted incident. The Honduran Government has orally indicated
                            its regret and stated that a full investigation was being initiated.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the Department’s attention is drawn to Article 153 of
                            the new Honduran Constitution of 1936, which states in part:— <quote

                        <p>It has been learned that at the time of the adoption of the Constitution
                            of 1936 the British Government presented a Note to the Honduran
                            Government indicating its non-acceptance of this designation of
                            territorial waters of twelve kilometers (seven and one-half miles), as
                            in contradiction to international usage in the conception of territorial
                            waters as being approximately three miles from the lowest tide mark.</p>
                        <p>In the present case, there is no assumption that the Honduran Government
                            was within its rights in stopping the <hi rend="italic">Caoba</hi>
                            within the twelve <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0606"/>kilometer
                            limit, as the <hi rend="italic">Caoba</hi> was admittedly stopped about
                            twelve miles from the shore.</p>
                        <p>However, should a similar case occur within Honduran territorial waters
                            as defined in Article 153 of the Constitution of 1936, there would
                            appear to be no basis of protest unless reservations had been or should
                            be made relative to the Article in question.</p>
                        <p>The Legation would appreciate any comments which the Department might
                            care to make with regard to its view of this definition of territorial

                            to Belize after the landing referred to of a group of insurgents and a
                            cargo of arms and ammunition near Tela. The British Chargé d’Affaires in
                            Tegucigalpa informs me that the attack took place in the territorial
                            waters of British Honduras and was witnessed by persons on nearby keys.
                            He has lodged a protest with the Honduran Foreign Office which, he
                            states, was mild in form as the traffic in which the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Stella H</hi>. was engaged is known. The <hi rend="italic">Stella

                            Powery (or Powrie) is a citizen of the Republic of Honduras, and no harm
                            appears to have been done in the attack, to the <hi rend="italic">Stella

                            “that American aviators would not be used in military operations”. It is
                            now evident that these assurances were <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599"
                                facs="0609"/>not fulfilled, since the American pilots were actively
                            employed during the course of the operations recently carried out
                            against insurgent groups in Honduras. The machine gun attack on the
                            Honduran sloop <hi rend="italic">Stella H</hi>. in the territorial
                            waters of British Honduras is a case in point.</p>
                        <p>You are, therefore, instructed to seek an early audience with the
                            President of Honduras and to reiterate to him the importance which this
                            Government attaches to the non-employment of American citizens in active
                            military operations within or without the borders of Honduras and to
                            request him to give you renewed assurances that they will not be so
                            employed.</p>
                        <p>You should also, at an opportune time, inform the American aviators of
                            the provisions of Section 5282 of the Revised Statutes, and advise them
                            that the obvious intent of the neutrality laws of the United States is
                            to discountenance the enlistment of American citizens in foreign armed
                            forces.</p>

                        <p>In compliance with instruction No. 186 of April 19, 1937, to the Legation
                            at Tegucigalpa, I called on President Carias on April 29, 1937,
                            presented to him the views of the Department, as expressed in that
                            instruction, and asked that assurances be given me by him that the
                            American aviators connected with the Military Aviation School would not
                            be employed in active military operations within or without the
                            boundaries of Honduras.</p>
                        <p>The President said that as regards military operations anywhere beyond
                            the boundaries of Honduras he could give the most unqualified
                            assurances. He referred to the “attack” on the schooner <hi
                                rend="italic">Stella H</hi>. in British Honduran waters by a
                            Honduran Army plane piloted by an American aviator and stated that the
                            aviator in that instance had acted without instructions from the
                            Government. Two planes had been sent out to find and keep track of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Stella H</hi>. which had landed General Umaña and
                            a handful of revolutionists near Tela. One of the pilots discovered the
                                <hi rend="italic">Stella H</hi>. in British Honduran waters and
                            zoomed down over the schooner several times and fired off a machine gun
                            for the purpose of frightening the Captain who was alone on the schooner
                            but making no attempt to injure either the Captain or the vessel.
                            Instructions have been given all aviators <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600"
                                facs="0610"/>connected with the Military Aviation School which will
                            prevent the recurrence of any similar incident.</p>
                        <p>As regards the use of the American aviators of the Military Aviation
                            School in assisting the Government troops in suppressing disturbances of
                            the public order, such as those which have taken place at times in
                            Honduras during the past eighteen months and which he claimed could not
                            properly be characterized as revolutionary, the President said frankly
                            that he could not, at the present time, promise he would not call on the
                            air force piloted by American aviators if an attempt should be made to
                            overthrow his government by armed force. He emphasized that if he did
                            give such an assurance, and it became known, as it doubtless would, his
                            political opponents would be unwarrantedly encouraged to try to foment a
                            revolution against his government which might mean a considerable period
                            of disorder in Honduras. He said that as matters stood he anticipated no
                            uprising against his government from any source and consequently foresaw
                            no occasion for the employment of the American aviators of the Military
                            Aviation School in active military operations and he was very confident
                            that those conditions would continue. He said that he was hopeful that
                            within six or eight months after the completion of the Military Aviation
                            School now under construction it would be possible for the Government to
                            rely entirely on Honduran aviators trained in that school by its
                            American instructors.</p>
                        <postscript>
                            <p rend="flushleft">(Note): The school buildings are being constructed
                                at a cost of some $60,000 and should be ready for occupancy in
                                August. Equipment for the practical instruction of Honduran cadets
                                in the construction principles and details of airplane engines and
                                equipment, and in measures necessary to proper upkeep, has been
                                purchased in the United States and will be installed in the school
                                as soon as the buildings are completed. In the opinion of the
                                undersigned, the Honduran Government since the inception of the plan
                                for an aviation school, about one year ago, has given its best
                                attention toward getting the school organized and ready for
                                practical operation. During the course of this and though without
                                any establishment for general training for aviators, three Honduran
                                cadets have been given sufficient instruction in flying so that they
                                might now be trusted to make solo flights. They will not be allowed
                                to do so, however, until they have had shop and general instruction
                                to fit them to take care of a plane if it got into difficulties
                                during the course of a solo flight, I believe the President is
                                sincere in wishing to build up a corps of Honduran aviators to fly
                                the Government planes and that efforts to that end will be
                                continued. My opinion would be that by the end of the year or
                                shortly thereafter it should be possible for the Honduran Government
                                to man its planes with Honduran aviators to meet any emergency which
                                might arise.</p>
                            <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0611"/>
                            <p>I think that if the President of Honduras is pressed, at the present
                                time, to promise that he will not avail himself of the services of
                                the American aviators connected with the Military Aviation School in
                                case a disturbance of the public order, whether revolutionary or
                                not, should occur, he will take steps to replace them in the School
                                by instructors of some other nationality. As has been pointed out in
                                previous despatches from the Legation, this might lead to
                                regrettable consequences. Colonel Pate, Military Attaché of the
                                Legation, during the course of his visit to Tegucigalpa in March of
                                this year, went over all of the Legation’s correspondence in regard
                                to the question of the American aviators in the employ of the
                                Honduran Government. He expressed himself as hopeful that the issue,
                                which appears to be a passing one, would not be forced to a point
                                where the Honduran Government, in order to prevent the
                                immobilization of its air force until cadets to fly the planes could
                                be trained, would find it necessary to employ a non-American
                                personnel for the School in replacement of Mr. William Brooks and
                                the other Americans who are now in course of establishing it. I
                                suggested—and Colonel Pate agreed—that he write the War Department
                                to that effect as a matter of record.</p>

                            William C. Brooks left Honduras on Saturday, October 30, 1937, for the
                            United States, not to return.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the above-mentioned despatch, this leaves no American
                            pilots whatsoever in the employ of the Honduran Government. However, it
                            has been learned, but not confirmed, that Mr. Harold A. White, who was
                            formerly associated with Mr. Lowell Yerex in the control and management
                            of Transportes Aereos Centro-Americanos, is to replace “Colonel” Brooks
                            as Director of the Escuela Militar de Aviacion. At the moment, the
                            Honduran Air Force is headed by Captain Luis Alonzo Fiallos, who has
                            under his command eight trained Honduran pilots. There is also one
                            naturalized American mechanic.</p>

                            that the despatch has recently been sent to your office by Mr.

                        <p>I would invite your attention to pages 6, 7, and 8 of the memorandum
                            accompanying the despatch respecting the situation in the Yaqui Valley.
                            It appears that President Cardenas is determined to expropriate portions
                            of the farms of about one hundred or more American farmers in that
                            Valley. On page 8 of the memorandum appears the following statement
                            concerning President Cardenas’ attitude: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“… if President Roosevelt insisted on it <hi rend="italic">the

                                    save him from embarrassment and difficulty in the United

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Some time ago we took the position in instructions sent to Ambassador
                            Daniels that the Department cannot acquiesce in the expropriation of
                            lands belonging to American citizens unless prompt and effective
                            compensation based upon the actual loss to the owner is to be paid.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the threatened expropriation of Yaqui Valley lands belonging
                            to American citizens, it seems to me that earnest and careful
                            consideration should be given to the advisability of requesting the
                            President to authorize the Department to instruct the Ambassador <pb
                                n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0613"/>to advise the President of
                            Mexico in due course along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The President cannot regard without deep concern the continuance
                                    of a policy in Mexico which amounts virtually to confiscation of
                                    American-owned lands. While the President would have no
                                    objection to a settlement of the specific case of the Yaqui
                                    Valley problem along the lines of a plan acceptable to the
                                    American landowners in that area, he sincerely hopes that not as
                                    a favor but as a matter of right from now on there may be a
                                    cessation of expropriations of American-owned lands in Mexico
                                    unless prompt and effective compensation based upon the actual
                                    loss to the owners of such lands is to be paid. The President
                                    also anticipates that arrangements will shortly be made by the
                                    Mexican Government for the effective compensation of American
                                    citizens who have already been deprived of their property.<note
                                        n="4" xml:id="d604fn4">The Secretary of State discussed this
                                        subject at length with President Roosevelt. The latter
                                        agreed with Mr. Hull that with regard to cases of
                                        expropriation arising in Mexico, each case might be treated
                                        and dealt with upon “its own special state of facts”. The
                                        United States would at the same time preserve its “formula
                                        and principle of just compensation.” (812.52/2212).
                                        Subsequently, the Secretary brought up the question in his
                                        conversation with the Mexican Ambassador on April 20, 1937;

                            Mr. John D. Stocker, representative of the American landowners in the
                            Yaqui Valley, together with the pertinent portion of your reply to Mr.
                            Stacker’s communication. It appears that the American landowners have
                            suggested that the Department should request the Mexican Government to
                            make known its intentions with reference to possible expropriation of
                            American-owned lands in the Yaqui Valley before making any definite
                            resolution in the matter.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the matter has been the subject of discussions
                            between the Department’s representatives and officials of the Mexican
                            Government, the Department is reluctant to believe that that Government
                            would take definitive action looking to the expropriation of the lands
                            in question without giving the Department’s representatives previous
                            notice of its intentions in that respect. However, it should be
                            understood that the Department cannot assume the responsibility that
                            would be entailed by its giving the American landowners a definite
                            assurance that they will be advised in advance of any such action as may
                            be contemplated.</p>

                            informed whether, in connection with other expropriations affecting
                            lands owned by American citizens, application for compensation for which
                            was not filed within one year as prescribed by the Agrarian Code,<note

                            diplomatic claims might be filed by the owners.</p>
                        <p>The Department considers that it would be advisable for all American
                            citizens whose lands in Mexico are expropriated to make application to
                            the Mexican authorities for compensation therefor in accordance with the
                            requirements of Mexican law. This, it is believed, should be done even
                            in those cases where the limitation on such application has expired. If
                            any such claimants should present a claim before making application to
                            the Mexican authorities for compensation, the Department would not, of
                            course, refuse to examine the claim. It should be understood, however,
                            that in receiving them, the Department does not obligate itself to do
                            more than to give consideration thereto with a view to determining
                            whether a valid claim exists and, if so, whether it should be presented
                            at some early date as an individual case to the Mexican Government or
                            held for presentation at a later date with other similar cases.</p>

                        <p>It is understood that a decision is impending on numerous petitions for
                                <hi rend="italic">ejidal</hi> dotations affecting a great many
                            American-owned <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0615"/>properties of
                            large and moderate dimensions in the Yaqui Valley. If these lands are
                            expropriated very many individual Americans will be deprived of their
                            properties.</p>
                        <p>When confronted a year or more ago with the probable loss of their
                            properties in the near future, the landowners are understood to have
                            joined together and proposed alternative solutions of the local land
                            problem, one of which contemplated the creation of an <hi rend="italic"
                                >ejidal</hi> district from land to be contributed by the private
                            owners, which land was to be put in shape for the growing of crops at
                            the present owners’ expense. Another plan involved the contribution of a
                            substantial fund by the landowners by voluntary assessment over a period
                            of a few years, which fund was to be employed for the purpose of
                            enabling the agrarians to cultivate Government-owned lands, which are
                            said to be available for distribution to them. During the last five or
                            six months, the landowners, with the informal assistance of the American
                            Vice Consul at Guaymas, have been trying to persuade the Mexican
                            Government to accept one of these alternative propositions. There is no
                            indication thus far that these efforts have been successful and the
                            interested American citizens are now fearful lest action depriving them
                            of their properties may suddenly be taken without further notice.</p>
                        <p>It is earnestly hoped that the Government of the United States or its
                            representatives will be consulted before any final decisions affecting
                            these American-owned properties are reached.</p>

                            brought up the land seizure question and, after expressing lasting
                            friendship and interest, said that we were in entire sympathy with any
                            program to distribute lands among the peasants; that as friends and
                            neighbors we were encouraging the same thing in Cuba; and that we had no
                            sympathy with people from other countries going into Mexico and fleecing
                            the Mexican people by any sort of method. I said that any foreigner
                            going there and purchasing properties <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606"
                                facs="0616"/>for a trifle and later expecting the Mexican Government
                            to pay large amounts therefor, comparatively speaking, was without any
                            sympathy so far as I was aware or concerned; that the only real question
                            arising was whether it was possible for the Mexican Government—when some
                            citizen from this country, in good faith and in a spirit of good will
                            towards Mexico, had gone there and in a perfectly honest manner
                            purchased lands or other properties with no plan or purpose to make
                            undue or unreasonable profits or, as stated, to fleece the Mexicans, but
                            solely with a view to fair play and fair dealing—to determine what would
                            be reasonable and just in the way of compensation when properties were
                            thus taken; if so, that it would be much appreciated by this Government
                            and would enable us to be much more helpful to the Mexican Government
                            and the Mexican people than we otherwise would be able in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Treasury promptly replied that he understood and
                            appreciated this viewpoint and that they were undertaking to work to
                            this end. He repeated it with emphasis.</p>

                        <p>Governor Yocupicio informed me yesterday in part that President Cardenas
                            would be in Sonora about May 20 at which time the latter might decide
                            the Yaqui Valley agrarian problem possibly by postponing it until the
                            completion of the Angostura Dam if he should decide to accept the
                            proposal of the American landowners, which acceptance, however, he could
                            not assure. The Governor suggested that all the landowners of the area
                            should organize immediately and start fund mentioned in the proposal of
                            the Americans out of the bumper wheat crop which is about to be
                            harvested, thereby demonstrating to the President immediately upon
                            arrival in the area, through concrete action already taken, their
                            willingness and ability to cooperate with the Government in the matter,
                            adding that fund so collected can be returned to the contributors by
                            their own committee if the President refuses the question and proceed
                            with the division of the valley under the agrarian code. Please instruct
                            me by telegraph if I may advise the Americans involved, informally and
                            without responsibility, of my conversation with the Governor and
                            possibly even suggest compliance. Embassy not informed.</p>

                            landowners in the Yaqui Valley, Sonora. You suggest that in case the

                            properties in the Yaqui Valley under the Agrarian Code, the American
                            landowners might find it advantageous to request the Mexican Government
                            to conduct the expropriation proceedings under the Expropriation Law of
                            November 23, 1936; and you inquire whether the Department desires that
                            you suggest to the landowners, informally and without responsibility,
                            that they consider the advisability of being prepared for such an

                            Such a suggestion would amount to the giving of advice regarding the
                            interpretation and applicability of Mexican legislation, and it is

                        <p>90. Your strictly confidential despatch No. 4643 of April 30.<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d612fn13">Not printed.</note> The Department agrees that the
                            Embassy is advocating a method of procedure <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608"
                                facs="0618"/>calculated at present to produce more effective results
                            by endeavoring to discuss agrarian cases with the Mexican Government
                            before they reach an acute stage in the hope that the Mexican Government
                            will find methods of adjustment with the American owners of the
                            property, so that solutions acceptable to the owners may be reached. You
                            may advise the Mexican authorities accordingly, referring specifically
                            in this relation to the cases of the Colorado River Land Company and the
                            Yaqui Valley landholders as among those which it would appear entirely
                            possible and highly desirable from the standpoint of both Governments to
                            adjust amicably. As corollary to the suggested procedure, you may
                            express the hope that Mexico will in future cases defer placing
                            agrarians in possession of American owned properties pending discussion
                            with the interested persons and the exhaustion of efforts to achieve a
                            mutually satisfactory settlement. You should make it clear, however,
                            that if this suggested procedure is adopted this Government must
                            necessarily retain full liberty of action with respect to the possible
                            presentation or support of claims of American nationals for proper
                            indemnification in the event that the latter are unable or unwilling to
                            agree to a settlement as a result of direct discussions or in the event
                            that no discussions take place.</p>
                        <p>With respect to proposals that have been submitted to the Mexican
                            authorities by the landowners in the Yaqui Valley or that may be
                            presented by other American citizens whose lands are threatened with
                            expropriation, the Embassy should understand that this Government cannot
                            undertake to pass on the merits of such proposals or to endeavor to
                            induce their acceptance either by the Mexican Government on the one hand
                            or by individual American landowners who may represent a minority
                            opinion on the other. However, it is believed that with respect to such
                            proposals, when they appear to the Embassy to be fair, the Embassy would
                            be warranted in endeavoring to bring about promptly meetings between the
                            proponents and the appropriate Mexican officials whereat such proposals
                            may be presented and thoroughly discussed, and furthermore that, while
                            the Embassy should not put itself in the position of endorsing
                            proposals, even though apparently worthy, it might well request early
                            and careful consideration thereof.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the fact that
                            in certain agrarian cases the prospects of assisting American landowners
                            appear to be <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0619"/>more favorable if
                            such cases are taken up with the Agrarian Department direct, rather than
                            “through channels” (i. e.—the Foreign Office).</p>
                        <p>In cases where the results obtained from the Agrarian Department are not
                            satisfactory (as for example that of Mrs. Mae Dunne Narró—despatch No.
                            5045 of July 15, 1937<note n="15" xml:id="d613fn15">Not
                            printed.</note>), the question arises of whether any claims or other
                            rights of the affected landowners are prejudiced by our not having dealt
                            with cases through the Foreign Office or by our failing, after having
                            been unsuccessful in the dealings with the Agrarian Department, to
                            report the circumstances to the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>We have made limited progress in the direct handling of several cases and
                            have some hope of achieving at least amelioration in specific instances.
                            Consequently, we are reluctant to abandon this method of dealing with
                            certain agrarian cases. It is thought possible, however, that if it is
                            necessary, in order to protect the rights of affected American
                            landowners, to inform the Foreign Office of the details of cases not
                            susceptible of solution at the Agrarian Department, the Foreign Office
                            may well raise objection to any direct relations between the Embassy and
                            the Foreign Office [<hi rend="italic">Agrarian Department</hi>].</p>
                        <p>The Department is respectfully requested to instruct the Embassy (1) as
                            to whether the possible eventual espousal and prosecution of the claims
                            of American citizens whose lands have been expropriated would be
                            prejudiced in instances where the cases had not been taken up through
                            the Foreign Office but had been discussed direct with the Agrarian
                            Department; and (2) as to whether, in the absence of an agreement by
                            landowners not to present any claims, the claims or other rights of such
                            landowners are prejudiced by the working out of a compromise agreement
                            through the Embassy and the Agrarian Department respecting the
                            “localization” of a “dotation” or “restitution” of lands from their
                            properties.</p>

                        <p>By courier to San Diego and Western Union. Reference despatch No. 1407

                            informed that at meeting called by Mixed Agrarian Commission at Mexicali
                            at Lazaro Cardenas Colony in Maneadero Valley today, attended by
                            Governor of Territory, Mixed Agrarian Commission delegate, agent of
                            Agricultural <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0620"/>Credit Bank,
                            various military and civil authorities, petitioners for land within said
                            colony, representative of Ventura Ensenada Land Company and by myself as
                            an observer, the Governor and delegate of Mixed Agrarian Commission
                            announced that the solicitude of the petitioners for land in the colony
                            had been acted upon favorably and that provisional grants had been made
                            from the following amounts of land: 2,000 hectares of national lands,
                            1,800 hectares from Victor Marsh Company, 1,000 hectares from Ventura
                            Ensenada Land Company and 500 hectares from Carl Carr. Judging from my
                            conversation with Governor and Chief of Second Military Zone previous to
                            meeting and to their and other addresses at meeting, the intention of
                            the authorities is as much to deprive foreigners of their use of lands
                            as to assist nationals in bettering their economic condition … Mixed
                            Agrarian Commission agent informed me that representatives of the
                            affected properties have not exercised various of the privileges
                            extended by the agrarian code with respect to presentation of
                            observations and delineation of lands which they might wish to reserve
                            and my study of the case indicates this to be true. My belief is that
                            their legal advisers, possibly through ignorance but probably on account
                            of pressure from local authorities or agrarian elements, have misled
                            their clients. Embassy will be informed by code tomorrow and Department
                            and Embassy will be kept currently informed of developments.</p>

                        <p>Your August 15, 1937. The Department understands that a decree issued by
                            the governor of a state or by a local commission under the Mexican
                            Agrarian Law is subject to review by the Agrarian Department at Mexico
                            City before a final expropriation decree may be issued, and that during
                            the proceedings the owner of an affected property is afforded an
                            opportunity under the law to defend his rights and interests therein
                            before that Department.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that you suggest to the American landowners affected
                            the advisability of their arranging either directly or through
                            representatives to defend their rights and interests before the
                            appropriate Mexican agrarian authorities. Inform them that you will be
                            glad upon request, to render proper assistance to them or their
                            representatives, but that the Consulate cannot assume responsibility for
                            the execution of the legal procedure involved or the details

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 185 of September 8, 6 P.M., and recent reports
                            from Vice Consul Yepis,<note n="19" xml:id="d617fn19">Reports not

                        <p>Upon receipt of the Department’s telegram in reference, I again mentioned
                            to General Hay our interest in the matter. General Hay asked that I
                            speak also to the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs on the subject.</p>
                        <p>There follows a summary of that part of my conversation on September 13
                            at the Foreign Office with the Undersecretary concerning the matter:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I took up with Mr. Beteta the situation with reference to the
                                    dotation of lands, belonging to Americans, to Mexicans who had
                                    made application for land under the Agrarian laws, mentioning
                                    particularly the Yaqui Valley lands about which I had talked at
                                    length with President Cardenas some months ago.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Beteta said the situation as to the Yaqui Valley was one that
                                    had given him much concern. He did not think that any action
                                    would be taken immediately as to their lands. He asked me how
                                    many Americans had land in that section and I told him there
                                    were upwards of one hundred, and that I had made representations
                                    to President Cardenas personally in their behalf.</p>
                            </quote></p>

                            instructions from the President of Mexico, I have addressed an <pb

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I called on Licenciado Beteta,
                            Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, by appointment at the Foreign Office
                            today to discuss various pending matters.</p>
                        <p>I first mentioned the question of the Yaqui Valley along the lines of a
                            memorandum of which a copy is being submitted under cover of a separate
                                despatch<note n="21" xml:id="d618fn21">Not printed.</note> (copy <hi
                                rend="italic">not</hi> left at Foreign Office), supplemented by
                            observations to the effect that before very long our Congress would
                            re-assemble and the matter might be discussed very acrimoniously were
                            the lands of American citizens in the Yaqui Valley to be expropriated
                            under the Agrarian Code. I also called attention to the substance of a
                            telegram from the American Consul at Guaymas dated October 4, 1937,<note
                                n="21" xml:id="d618fn27">Not printed.</note> in which the Consul
                            said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The State Secretary General, in the absence of the Governor,
                                    informed me today definitely that the Yaqui lands will be
                                    divided later this month upon the arrival from Mexico City of
                                    Agrarian Chief Vázquez who will bring the Agrarian Department
                                    file on the case with him. I will leave tonight for Consular
                                    Convention at Mexico City. Department has been informed.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Licenciado Beteta said that he was not familiar with the latest
                            developments in the Yaqui Valley case. I told him that last December I
                            had discussed the matter at some length with President Cardenas and I
                            requested Mr. Beteta to ask the President to take no action in the
                            matter until I could see him again. Mr. Beteta replied that the
                            President was expected to return to Mexico City on October 8, and that
                            he would make arrangements for me to have an interview promptly with
                            President Cárdenas.</p>
                        <p>On the general subject of agrarianism as it affects American citizens, I
                            stated to Mr. Beteta that I did not see how Mexico could possibly
                            justify its policy of expropriating lands without making provision for
                            them, his Government having in the original legislation authorized the
                            issue of bonds in payment of lands expropriated. I then handed him a
                            copy of the enclosure to my despatch number 5489 dated October <pb
                                n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0623"/>5, 1937,<note n="22"
                                xml:id="d618fn22">Not printed.</note> consisting of figures taken
                            from Mr. Simpson’s “The Ejido.”<note n="23" xml:id="d618fn23">Eyler N.
                                Simpson, <hi rend="italic">The Ejido, Mexico’s Way Out</hi> (Chapel
                                Hill, 1937), pp. 221–222.</note> These figures were attributed to
                            Mexican official sources by Mr. Simpson. Without definitely indicating
                            the source of the figures, I said that they were the best available and
                            inquired why Mexico could not at least issue the remaining bonds which
                            had been authorized, and stressed the importance to Mexico of at least
                            paying for the lands dotated. The reply was made that this avenue would
                            be explored. (I may observe here that the Commercial Attaché<note n="24"
                                xml:id="d618fn24">Thomas H. Lockett.</note> has been informally
                            advised by the Secretary of the Treasury that he has worked out a plan
                            for the payment of bonds to affected land owners. The Commercial Attaché
                            also understands that a part of the two million pesos supposed to have
                            been included in this year’s budget for the beginning of payment of the
                            agrarian debt, was allocated to the issuance of bonds of the interior
                            public debt, which are now being exchanged for the old Federal agrarian
                            bonds, and that the remainder will be set up in the Treasury towards
                            redemption of the coupons of the new bonds it is proposed to issue. The
                            plan the Secretary of the Treasury has in mind apparently does not
                            envisage any payment of accrued interest on existing agrarian bonds, but
                            does contemplate servicing the new bonds to be issued.)</p>
                        <p>I also took up the matter of the threatened dotation of lands in San Luis
                            Potosi, known as the Hacienda de Pardo, belonging to Valdemar Knudsen,
                            Edward D. Bangs and Emile Von Hiller, all American citizens. Mr. Beteta
                            said that the agrarian question in San Luis Potosi was a complicated one
                            due to the existence of several schools of thought on the subject. One,
                            as a result of General Cedillo’s<note n="25" xml:id="d618fn25">Saturnino
                                Cedillo, former Minister for Agriculture.</note> influence, being a
                            preference for ownership of lands in fee simple, which course is
                            apparently advocated by various <hi rend="italic">campesinos</hi> who in
                            this way are on the side of the land owners. He promised to look into
                            the matter of the Hacienda El Pardo concerning which I left a memorandum
                            (copy enclosed with separate despatch) with him.</p>
                        <p>I also took up the matter of the regulations of the so-called Stolen
                            Automobile Convention,<note n="26" xml:id="d618fn26">Signed October 6,
                                1936, Department of State Treaty Series No. 914, or 50 Stat.
                                1333.</note> and suggested that the best way to put an end to the
                            present delay would be for him to designate a representative of the
                            Foreign Office to confer with a member of my staff. This thought seemed
                            to appeal to Mr. Beteta and he said that in a day or two he would advise
                            me of the name of the representative he would designate.</p>

                            despatch no. 5056 dated July 16, 1937 in regard to the propriety and
                            effect of taking up directly with the Agrarian Department cases
                            involving the expropriation of land belonging to American citizens.</p>
                        <p>With respect to your first question it may be stated that the Department
                            perceives no reason why the possible eventual espousal and prosecution
                            of the claims of American citizens whose lands have been expropriated
                            should be prejudiced in instances where the cases have not been taken up
                            through the Mexican Foreign Office but have been discussed directly with
                            the Agrarian Department.</p>
                        <p>As to your second question the Department informs you that in the absence
                            of an agreement by landholders not to present any claims, their claims
                            or rights would not, in its opinion, be prejudiced by the working out of
                            a compromise agreement through the Embassy and the Agrarian Department.
                            Such an agreement would presumably envisage the expropriation of a
                            portion of the lands owned and no reason is perceived why the owner of
                            such lands would not have a just claim for compensation on account of
                            the land so taken even if a compromise agreement should be effected.</p>
                        <p>However, it would seem advisable in all expropriation and squatter cases
                            for the Embassy to forward a note to the Foreign Office in connection
                            with each case as it arises before discussing the case directly with the
                            Agrarian Department, and to address such further notes to the Foreign
                            Office as circumstances in each case may appear to warrant.</p>

                            pouch an account of my conversation of today with President Cardenas on

                        <p>The President told me he would telephone to the head of the Agrarian
                            Department at Ciudad Obregon this afternoon asking him and the Governor
                            of Sonora, accompanied by representatives of landowners of American and
                            Mexican nationality in the Yaqui Valley, to come to Mexico City to
                            discuss the situation with him next week. He expects that no dotation
                            would be made prior to this discussion. He feels that efforts to
                            compensate through issuance of bonds would be of no material benefit to
                            Americans. These bonds would have to be issued previously for all land
                            taken since 1931. He hopes to reach an adjustment with Yaqui landowners
                            by giving them land not now irrigated but which is to be irrigated from
                            the dam which is to be completed in 1939. This land would he in
                            compensation for all land taken from them over and above the 100
                            hectares to be left each of them as <hi rend="italic">pequeña
                                propiedad</hi>. He assured me these <hi rend="italic">pequeñas

                                seasonal lands not exceeding 300 hectares, were not to be affected

                        <p>He said that in order to avoid future dotations, the Americans receiving
                            such land in compensation should sell it in small tracts upon completion
                            of the dam. He has under consideration the issuance of bonds at low
                            interest rate in compensation for land taken in other parts of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that Yepis be instructed to report to the Embassy at Mexico
                            City when representatives of American landowners come here. He has been
                            advised of proposed conference and of this recommendation.</p>

                        <p>281. Representative of American landowners and representatives of other
                            landowners in the Yaqui saw President Cardenas yesterday, Gabio Vasques
                                [<hi rend="italic">Gabino Vásquez</hi>] and the Governor of Sonora
                            were present. The President, according to the representative of American
                            landowners, told them that unirrigated lands would be given them in
                            exchange for their irrigated properties, that they could select and keep
                            100 hectares of their present lands apiece, that they would have water
                            for these 10 hectares tracts, that when the Angostura dam is finished in
                            1939 they could irrigate and sell the exchange lands, indicating that
                            discussion of any other proposals would be useless.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing I saw Beteta this afternoon to stress the
                            seriousness of the situation and urge discussion of arrangements with
                            the landowners’ representative here before dotation. Boal saw him again
                            tonight leaving him a map and a memorandum of points meriting
                            consideration before final action is taken. Beteta was urged to endeavor
                            to arrange to have landowners complete planting of wheat and harvest
                            crop in June 1938 before dotations are made. Suarez<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d622fn31">Eduardo Suarez, Minister of Finance.</note> was
                            also urged to press the merits of this suggestion with the President.
                            Beteta has now gone to see the President.</p>
                        <p>Gabino Vasquez and the Governor of Sonora are scheduled to return to the
                            Yaqui tomorrow to proceed with dotation.</p>
                        <p>The representative[s] of the landowners have tonight received a copy of
                            the Presidential <hi rend="italic">acuerdo</hi> ordering dotation of the
                            Yaqui Valley lands on October 31st and containing the provisions

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I called today at the Foreign Office and
                            had a long talk with Mr. Beteta about the situation with reference to
                            the dotation of lands in the Yaqui Valley. I handed him a formal note, a
                            copy of which I am enclosing herewith, which he read and we then
                            discussed its contents. He said that he was rather disappointed that the
                            situation <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0627"/>was as I represented
                            it and that the President had thought, since he had offered to give the
                            Americans other lands, that they were satisfied. I told him that
                            doubtless their courtesy to the President and their respect for him had
                            caused them to seem to be satisfied and that they had not had the
                            opportunity to present their counterproposals as they had desired. I
                            told him that the Embassy had received communications from senators who
                            had constituents who were affected by these dotations of lands and that
                            they were very perturbed—I mentioned Mr. MacAdoo among others— and that
                            these senators, doubtless, if the situation could not be adjusted or
                            modified would send their protests to the Department of State and that
                            unless some agreement were reached a situation might arise which could
                            be very embarrassing for both countries. Mr. Beteta said that he
                            appreciated that fact and that he would read my note very carefully. I
                            told him that I understood that German and Mexican land owners, who were
                            in the same boat as the American land owners, had seen Mr. Suarez, the
                            Minister of Hacienda, this morning and that Mr. Suarez seemed very
                            sympathetic to their suggestions, especially with reference to payment
                            for tools, material, etc. and the giving of a longer time for the
                            planting of wheat and the harvesting thereof. Mr. Beteta said he would
                            take up the matter at once with Mr. Suarez and give consideration to all
                            I had said in person and to the formal official note which I gave
                            him.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to
                                the interview of this morning between President Cárdenas and the
                                representative of the American landowners in the Yaqui Valley, as
                                related to me by the latter.</p>
                            <p>Certain courses of action are understood to have been outlined to
                                that representative, concerning which I desire to offer the
                                following observations.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the apparent intention of the Mexican Government to dotate
                                more than four hectares (from 5 to 8 hectares) of American-owned
                                land to each <hi rend="italic">ejidatario</hi> on the theory that
                                the land is “temporal” (Article 47, paragraph II of the Agrarian
                                Code) it may be observed that the Government intends to allow <hi
                                    rend="italic">pequeñas propiedades</hi> of only 100 hectares to
                                each American landowner. This would appear to <pb n="618"
                                    xml:id="pg_618" facs="0628"/>present a combination of
                                circumstances not in keeping with the Agrarian Code. Article 51,
                                paragraph II, of that Code, provides that when the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >pequeña propiedad</hi> is in “temporal” lands, it shall be of
                                300 hectares, or under the circumstances described in the last
                                paragraph of Article 51, it is to consist of 200 hectares. It
                                appears, therefore, if the information reaching me is correct, that
                                the lands which it is proposed to dotate are being classified in two
                                different ways in the same decision, to the disadvantages of the
                                American landowners and without following the Agrarian Code of
                                Mexico. I am informed by the representative of the American
                                landowners opportunity was not afforded him for presentation of his
                                views and reasons in support of them.</p>
                            <p>The question of indemnification of the American landowners for their
                                canals and other irrigation works (Article 54 of the Agrarian Code)
                                on their property proposed by the Government for affectation does
                                not seem to have been resolved. Likewise the question of equality of
                                water rights on the affected lands and the lands it is proposed to
                                give the American owners in exchange appears not to have been
                                thoroughly explored.</p>
                            <p>Respecting the proposed evaluation of the lands to be taken and the
                                lands to be given in exchange therefor, my Government strongly feels
                                that there should be no dotations until the evaluations have been
                                completed and that this should also apply in the matter of the
                                payment for equipment, animals and other objects to be acquired by
                                the Mexican Government.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the proposed dotation of American owned lands in
                                the Yaqui Valley, it is understood that President Cardenas has
                                approved the continuance of planting of wheat until October 30,
                                1937. Such plantings are to be exempt from dotation until the wheat
                                crop has been harvested.</p>
                            <p>Apparently reliable estimates indicate that approximately only 30% of
                                the wheat crop can be planted prior to October 30.</p>
                            <p>I am informed that since all of the wheat lands have already been
                                plowed and irrigated at considerable expense, the owners will suffer
                                great loss if they are not granted several weeks additional time for
                                the planting of the remaining 70% of their wheat lands, and, of
                                course, allowed to harvest the entire wheat crop. Moreover, it is
                                doubtful whether the <hi rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi> could be
                                organized in time to plant the crop before the planting season
                                expires. Thus, a greatly deficient wheat crop, with consequent loss
                                to the national economy, is to be expected if the American
                                landowners are not given the facilities they desire to complete the
                                planting and harvesting of that crop.</p>
                            <p>Thus, in the interest of all concerned, it is practically most
                                desirable that the request of the landowners in this regard be
                                approved.</p>
                            <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0629"/>
                            <p>It is to be observed that in most cases practically all of the
                                financial resources of the American farmers in the Yaqui Valley are
                                tied up in their lands, their equipment, and the preparations
                                already made for sowing wheat.</p>
                            <p>As I have heretofore said to you, by direction of my Government,
                                which is greatly disturbed over the taking of land from Americans,
                                it urges that adequate compensation should be made both for lands
                                affected under the Agrarian Code, and for the improvements on these
                                lands prior to dotation.</p>
                            <p>Please accept [etc.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            5588 of October 28, 1937, and to enclose (1) a copy of a strictly

                        <p>I expect Licenciado Beteta to advise me today of the outcome of his
                            conversation with President Cárdenas last night. I believe that, as
                            President Cardenas apparently issued his <hi rend="italic">acuerdo</hi>
                            before receiving the views for which he had asked me and since the <hi
                                rend="italic">acuerdo</hi> was made public here in this morning’s
                            newspapers, there is little likelihood of obtaining the delay for
                            harvesting the crop in June which was requested. It is possible,
                            however, that if we continue to press for other points connected with
                            the transfer of non-irrigated lands in exchange for irrigated lands
                            provided for in the <hi rend="italic">acuerdo</hi>, some results helpful
                            to the American landowners may yet be obtained.</p>

                            <p>1. Acta should contain a list of the Americans and authority for them
                                to own new lands within 50 kilometers of the coast.</p>
                            <p>2. There are approximately 41 properties in the Yaqui Valley in
                                excess of 100 hectares either owned outright by Americans or by
                                companies which are practically owned by Americans.</p>
                            <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0630"/>
                            <p>3. These 41 landholders have a total of approximately 18000 hectares
                                of irrigated lands. Deducting from the foregoing 18000 hectares,
                                4100 as <hi rend="italic">pequeñas propiedades</hi> at the rate of
                                100 hectares for irrigated land, we have approximately 13900
                                hectares which it is understood the Mexican Government desires to
                                affect.</p>
                            <p>4. The crop production on this land which the Government desires to
                                affect represents a net income of approximately 26 pesos per hectare
                                per year. Therefore the net income annually for the area to be
                                affected is approximately 361,400 pesos.</p>
                            <p>5. These properties have certain improvements on them including
                                irrigation systems which alone represent very roughly an investment
                                of 69,500 pesos.</p>
                            <p>6. In addition to this there are fences, dwellings, other buildings,
                                animals, equipment, and drainage systems. The value of these can not
                                be estimated even approximately without a survey for that specific
                                purpose.</p>

                            <p>In view of the above, it would seem that the improvements on the land
                                if and when dotated should be assessed and paid for in accordance
                                with the Code. It may be observed that the irrigated area in which
                                affectations are planned in [<hi rend="italic">is?</hi>]
                                approximately 45,000 hectares of irrigated lands, of which the
                                agrarian commissions’ plans call for the affectation of
                                approximately 18000 hectares of irrigated lands.</p>
                            <p>8. It is understood that the areas now in the possession of the
                                Mexican Government bordering on the irrigated areas westward of the
                                principal irrigation canal can be irrigated by gravity when the
                                Angostura Dam is completed. In that event the blocks in those areas
                                would have to be prepared for irrigation and the irrigation systems
                                installed at the expense of the owners of the land. The region
                                eastward of the main irrigation canal and immediately adjacent to it
                                can be irrigated only by pumping unless an additional main canal
                                should be installed eastward of the present main canal. The cost of
                                installation and the <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0631"
                                />current cost of irrigation by pumping is understood to be
                                considerably higher than the cost of gravity irrigation. The cost of
                                installation alone for irrigation by pumping is understood to be at
                                least 35 pesos per hectare.</p>
                            <p>9. The above makes it obvious that lands given in exchange for lands
                                dotated should be irrigable by gravity.</p>
                            <p>10. The landowners observe that plans now drawn by the Agrarian
                                Commissions already indicate <hi rend="italic">pequeñas
                                    propiedades</hi> although it is understood that the owners are
                                to have a right to select these. As shown on the plans these <hi
                                    rend="italic">pequeñas propiedades</hi> are in certain cases
                                isolated from the houses of owners. This would obviously make for
                                friction and difficulty of operation and should be rectified, the
                                owner being permitted to select his own <hi rend="italic">pequeña
                                    propiedad</hi>.</p>
                            <p>11. It is understood that these owners of <hi rend="italic">pequeñas
                                    propiedades</hi> are to be assured an equal proportion of water
                                with other owners and that they are not in any way to pay for the
                                water. We understand this to mean that the owners of <hi
                                    rend="italic">pequeñas propiedades</hi> are not to be called
                                upon to contribute to the maintenance of the general system of
                                irrigating as distinct from irrigation systems located upon their
                                own <hi rend="italic">pequeñas propiedades</hi>.</p>
                            <p>12. It is contended that certain of the petitioners for dotation are
                                not qualified under the Agrarian Code for dotation and that there
                                may be other irregularities. An opportunity should be given the
                                owner, as it is understood is to be done in the Mayo Valley to
                                scrutinize the census lists and other elements of the dotation and
                                to present and discuss evidence regarding these lists and other
                                points in order that dotations may conform to the Agrarian Code.</p>
                            <p>13. It is understood that special arrangements are contemplated to
                                permit Americans receiving irrigated lands in exchange for lands
                                dotated to hold these unirrigated lands free from the danger of
                                further dotation until they have been irrigated and can be sold
                                fairly.</p>
                            <p>14. This number has been skipped.</p>
                            <p>15. It seems obvious from the above considerations that a study of
                                the conditions under which the proposed exchange of lands could be
                                carried out fairly should be made. This would involve estimation of
                                the value of the irrigated lands, and the improvements on them and
                                of the land to be given in exchange, and a study of the cost of
                                conditioning the new land and the amount of loss due to
                                non-production of crops which would fall upon the American
                                landowners. Presumably such a study would be made by a commission
                                composed of representatives of the Government and of the American
                                landowners.</p>
                            <p>16. It would seem beneficial both to the National economy and to the
                                American landowners that they should be permitted to plant and
                                harvest this year’s crop, pending a determination of these
                                conditions <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0632"/>by such a
                                commission, possession of the present irrigation land to be given
                                only after a satisfactory arrangement of the transfer of lands has
                                been concluded.</p>
                            <p>17. At the same time, a study could be made of the possibilities and
                                time of payment for improvements, and for the conditioning of the
                                new land, where the cost to the Government of conditioning the new
                                land was recovered through sales of that land, such sums would
                                presumably be repaid to the Government at the time of the sale. The
                                compensation for loss of crops to the American landowners pending
                                completion of the dam and general irrigation works could also be
                                studied by the commission.</p>
                            <p>18. It is suggested that a further meeting of the American landowners
                                and the appropriate representatives of the Government be held now to
                                go over the considerations above outlined.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I take pleasure in
                                referring to Your Excellency’s esteemed note 2486 of the 27th
                                instant regarding the interview which the representatives of the
                                American landowners of the Yaqui Valley had with the President of
                                the Republic; an interview of which they gave an account to Your
                                Excellency and which gave rise to certain observations contained in
                                the note under reference.</p>
                            <p>As regards the apparent duality in the classification of the lands to
                                which Your Excellency refers: that is, that they were considered
                                non-irrigated (<hi rend="italic">de temporal</hi>) for purposes of
                                dotating up to eight hectares to each <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ejidatario</hi>, and, on the other hand, were considered as
                                irrigated lands for the purpose of limiting each small property to
                                only one hundred hectares, I beg to inform Your Excellency as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>First: The owners of lands in the Yaqui Valley are not owners of the
                                water, and therefore the lands are, in reality, non-irrigated (<hi
                                    rend="italic">de temporal</hi>) and certainly would be converted
                                into irrigable lands subsequent to the dotations, upon application
                                of the Law of Waters, which gives preferential rights to <hi
                                    rend="italic">ejidos</hi>. Therefore, when the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ejidatarios</hi> are granted more than four hectares such
                                action is within the law.</p>
                            <p>Second: As a result of the foregoing, if the owners prefer that they
                                be left the small property which the Agrarian Code specifies for
                                non-irrigated land (up to 300 hectares), this can be done—but they
                                will not have water rights.</p>
                            <p>Third: Believing that the above solution is not favorable to the
                                interests of the owners, the Government thought it proper to convert
                                the non-irrigated lands into irrigated lands, giving them,
                                accordingly, an equal right (to water) as the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ejidos</hi> and making a free grant of water. Thus conditioned,
                                the lands are strictly irrigated lands, and therefore the small
                                property can consist of only one hundred hectares. Your Excellency
                                can see, therefore, that there has been no duality of standards,
                                but, on the contrary, a desire to help the affected landowners.</p>
                            <p>As regards indemnification asked by the owners for canals and other
                                irrigation works, it should be borne in mind that, since on the new
                                lands which they will receive there will also be improvements (<hi
                                    rend="italic">obras</hi>) of this nature, made at the cost of
                                the Mexican Government, such improvements will therefore be ample
                                compensation for the owners in question.</p>
                            <p>The matter of water rights pertaining to the lands which are given in
                                exchange for the properties affected is set forth absolutely clearly
                                in the <hi rend="italic">acuerdo</hi> issued by the President: The
                                Government of Mexico <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0636"/>will
                                give lands which are gravity-irrigated and equivalent to the lands
                                affected.</p>
                            <p>The appraisal prior to dotation, desired by the American Government,
                                is impossible in view of the fact that the dotations will be made
                                next Sunday, the 31st instant. But, since the nature and condition
                                of the lands would not vary, the appraisal can be made immediately
                                following the dotations, without fear of any change due to the mere
                                fact that the lands have been granted in dotation. The Government
                                believes it has a right to command confidence, and not the belief
                                that, once the lands have been distributed, it will cease to meet
                                its obligations (<hi rend="italic">cumplir sus
                                compromisos</hi>).</p>
                            <p>As regards the animals and tools, these will be paid for in cash at
                                the time they are delivered by their present owners to the <hi
                                    rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency is right in thinking that the crops obtained on these
                                lands which have been sown with wheat up to October 30th of this
                                year will belong to the present owners, and that crops sown later
                                than that date should be the property of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ejidatarios</hi>. This is in fact provided for in the
                                President’s Decree, already known to that Embassy. Nevertheless, the
                                owners will be indemnified for the work of preparing and irrigating
                                the lands. To prevent the danger of lowered production of wheat, an
                                effort will be made in each case to secure an arrangement between
                                the owners and the workers whereby the planting will not be delayed
                                and the owners not suffer losses.</p>
                            <p>As Your Excellency will see from the foregoing explanations, the
                                desire of the American Government that the owners of lands in the
                                Yaqui Valley should receive adequate compensation for tools and
                                equipment as well as for the lands affected, is met by the
                                provisions of the respective Presidential <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Acuerdo;</hi> for, as regards the lands, the owners will
                                receive the equivalent in other lands with water rights—lands in
                                reality better than those which they are losing, since at present
                                they have to pay for the water and in the future irrigation will be
                                free both for the small properties left to them and for the new
                                lands which are given to them for colonization purposes.</p>
                            <p>As regards equipment, tools, and animals, as well as the work done in
                                sowing wheat: the Government will indemnify in cash.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            5616 of November 2, 1937, enclosing a copy of a note from the Foreign
                            Office regarding <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0637"/>the Yaqui
                            Valley agrarian situation, and to enclose a copy of a note left with
                            Licenciado Beteta yesterday evening by Mr. Boal in reply to that
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation on the subject Licenciado Beteta
                            explained that while he had been under the impression that the President
                            intended to have the Agrarian Department endeavor to have arrangements
                            made between the American landowners and the agrarians for renting back
                            the lands dotated to them until the June wheat harvest, he realized now
                            that the President had merely referred to arrangements and he had drawn
                            his own deductions as to the rental system.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Boal urged him to endeavor to have the arrangements made on a rental
                            basis, pointing out that this was the current basis used in the Valley
                            and that the crop-sharing arrangements under that system were all
                            provided for by law in Sonora. He pointed out that the system provided
                            that the renter pay the taxes, water charges, and other expenses
                            connected with the land, so that the owner receives 12½% of the crop,
                            net. He informed Licenciado Beteta that the representative of the
                            American landowners had yesterday suggested that if rental arrangements
                            were made under the auspices of the Agrarian Department, the American
                            landowners would need to keep the greater part of their equipment until
                            the harvest had been gotten in. The 12½% share could then be taken up by
                            the Banco Ejidal and the proceeds used for the purchase of this
                            equipment after the harvest. This would make it unnecessary for the
                            Government to put out cash both to purchase equipment at the present
                            time and to finance the <hi rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi> for the
                            preparation of the land and other work connected with the crop.
                            Presumably those of the <hi rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi> who now work
                            for a wage on the land would thus continue to have employment, so that
                            the question of tiding them over until the harvest might not arise in
                            many cases. All this, it seemed, would be financially helpful to the
                            Government, while the landowners would have an opportunity to make their
                            usual crop before the lands were taken out of their hands.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, Mr. Boal pointed out that according to the
                            representative of the American landowners many of these would prefer to
                            have their <hi rend="italic">pequeña propiedad</hi>, as offered in the
                            Mexican Government’s note under reference, as non-irrigated land, thus
                            keeping two or three hundred hectares, instead of one hundred. In that
                            event it would be necessary to work out a rental adjustment which would
                            not constitute recognition by the American landowners of lands to be
                            dotated, since the amount and location of these lands would remain
                            uncertain until the <hi rend="italic">pequeñas propiedades</hi> of
                            non-irrigated land had been delimited. Obviously, the Government would
                            not wish to postpone the making of the rental arrangement until all <pb
                                n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0638"/>the <hi rend="italic">pequeñas
                                propiedades</hi> had been measured, since that would involve a
                            disastrous delay in the planting of the crop, to the disadvantage of all
                            parties concerned. He also pointed out that there were few people in the
                            Valley who made a business of planting and tending crops as contractors;
                            that the regular farmers did not and probably would not do this; that
                            those who did were not sufficient in number and had not enough equipment
                            to take care of any appreciable amount of the land in the Valley planned
                            for dotation. Under these circumstances the <hi rend="italic"
                                >ejidatarios</hi>, if no rental arrangement were reached, would have
                            to prepare the land, and it seemed likely that in the limited time
                            remaining for planting a great deal of land would either remain
                            un-planted or would be improperly planted and tended, so that the crops
                            would be unsatisfactory, to the detriment of everybody concerned.</p>
                        <p>Licenciado Beteta said that he would discuss these points with the
                            President with a view to trying to work out some arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                the receipt of the Foreign Office’s note 312243 of October 29,
                                    1937,<note n="34" xml:id="d626fn34"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>,
                                        <ref target="#pg_625">p. 625</ref>.</note> which reached me
                                yesterday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>In this note are set forth the Mexican Government’s reasons for
                                making a classification of the American-owned lands in the Yaqui
                                Valley as irrigated for the purposes of determining the <hi
                                    rend="italic">pequeñas propiedades</hi>, and as unirrigated with
                                respect to the dotations to the agrarians. In the paragraph marked
                                “Second” of that note you say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>As a result of the foregoing, if the owners prefer that they
                                        be left the small property which the Agrarian Code specifies
                                        for non-irrigated land (up to 300 hectares), there will be
                                        no difficulty in doing this—but they will not have water
                                        rights.</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>The representative of the American landowners in the Yaqui Valley
                                informs me that some, and possibly all, of the American landowners
                                wish to accept this offer and will file with such authorities as
                                Your Excellency may indicate applications for their small properties
                                as non-irrigated land, to receive up to three hundred hectares as
                                provided in the Agrarian Code. My understanding is that under this
                                arrangement the distribution of water to the American landowners <pb
                                    n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0639"/>will be governed by the
                                existing contract for the delivery of water, but that the <hi
                                    rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi> will be entitled to water rights
                                for themselves as set forth in the Agrarian Code.</p>
                            <p>The note under reference does not take up the question of the
                                eligibility of the persons on the census of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >ejidatarios</hi>. Am I correct in believing that the American
                                landowners in the Yaqui Valley will be permitted to challenge the
                                eligibility of persons on this list, under the Agrarian Code, not
                                only in general but particularly if it is claimed that there are a
                                sufficient number of applicants unsatisfied with land to cause the
                                American landowners to receive, under the provisions of the Agrarian
                                Code, less than the three hundred hectares for small properties of
                                non-irrigated land?</p>
                            <p>As regards indemnification, it is my understanding from the note
                                under reference that American landowners will receive new land, now
                                unirrigated but irrigable by gravity, in amounts adequately
                                compensating them for any of their lands dotated, to be improved
                                with canals and other irrigation works at the expense of the Mexican
                                Government, at least to the same extent as the lands to be dotated
                                now carry such improvements. Am I correct in believing that such
                                improvement will include the clearing of the new land, so that, when
                                irrigated, it will be similar in character to the land dotated? Am I
                                correct in my understanding that the irrigation system for this new
                                land will not only be installed on the land but will be brought to
                                it at the expense of the Mexican Government, and that this new land
                                will be the first to be opened to irrigation when the Angostura Dam
                                is completed? Am I correct in my understanding that the evaluation
                                of the lands to be dotated and of the new lands to be given in
                                compensation will be made by a commission composed of a
                                representative of the landowners, a representative of the Governor
                                of Sonora, with such technical assistants as may be necessary?</p>
                            <p>The note under reference does not deal with the question of
                                improvements, such as buildings, fences, drainage systems, bridges,
                                etc. Am I correct in believing that such improvements are to be paid
                                for?</p>
                            <p>The note under reference makes it clear that the animals and tools
                                belonging to the American landowners which they may wish to sell are
                                to be valued and will be paid for by the Government in cash, at the
                                time they are delivered by their present owners to the <hi
                                    rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi>. I should appreciate receiving
                                from Your Excellency information as to how the valuation is to be
                                carried out.</p>
                            <p>The note under reference does not indicate what compensation will be
                                made to American landowners for higher hauling costs in the event
                                that new lands to be given them in exchange for lands dotated are
                                farther removed from mills and railroads than their present
                                    holdings.<pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0640"/>I should
                                appreciate receiving information from Your Excellency on this
                                point.</p>
                            <p>The note under reference indicates that these new lands are to
                                receive free water as soon as the Angostura Dam can provide them
                                with this water. Am I correct in understanding that there will be no
                                cost whatever to the American landowners for this water: that is to
                                say, that they will not be called upon to contribute to the
                                maintenance of the general irrigation system or to pay any kind of
                                tax providing funds for such purposes?—and that this free water will
                                go with the land in perpetuity, thus increasing its sales value?</p>
                            <p>The note under reference does not deal specifically with any
                                compensation to the American landowners for the loss of crop
                                production during the years intervening from the present time until
                                water is brought on to their new lands and they can begin to farm
                                them. Am I correct in understanding that the American landowners
                                will be given permission to hold those lands for an extensive period
                                beyond the date of their receiving the water, so that the additional
                                value of the free water during the years when they can farm the new
                                lands will compensate them for the years during which they have been
                                unable to produce crops owing to lack of water?—further, that such
                                permission will be renewable, so that the American landowners will
                                not find themselves faced with a fixed date by which they must sell,
                                which would presumably adversely affect the possibility of selling
                                the land for its fair value? Am I correct in understanding that
                                during the period to which I refer above these lands will not be
                                subject to agrarian affectation? I should appreciate information on
                                these points from Your Excellency.</p>
                            <p>The note under reference informs me: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Your Excellency is right in thinking that the crops obtained
                                        on these lands which have been sown with wheat up to October
                                        30th of this year will belong to the present owners, and
                                        that crops sown later than that date should be the property
                                        of the <hi rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi>. This is in fact

                                        that Embassy. Nevertheless, the owners will be indemnified
                                        for the work of preparing and irrigating the lands. To
                                        prevent the danger of lowered production of wheat, an effort
                                        will be made in each case to secure an arrangement between
                                        the owners and the workers whereby the planting will not be
                                        delayed and the owners not suffer losses.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I have the honor to refer
                                to Your Excellency’s note number 2492 of the 3rd of the present
                                month.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency states that certain American landowners desire to
                                have their lands classified as lands irrigated by rains (temporal)
                                for the purpose of determining their <hi rend="italic">pequeña
                                    propiedad</hi>, and you ask me before which authorities they
                                should file application to this end.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I wish to inform Your Excellency as follows:</p>
                            <p>While it is true that in my previous note number 312243 of October
                                29th, I explained to that Embassy the reasons why there was no legal
                                objection to the selection by the landowners of the Yaqui Valley the
                                    <hi rend="italic">pequeña propiedad</hi> which the Agrarian Code
                                prescribes for lands irrigated by rains (temporal), provided they
                                were agreeable to not receiving water, nevertheless, in the same
                                note, under point three, I informed Your Excellency that that
                                solution was not expedient for the owners in question, and that for
                                that reason the Government had considered it advisable (<hi
                                    rend="italic">oportuno</hi>) to convert them into irrigated
                                lands (<hi rend="italic">tierras de riego</hi>), granting them water
                                free to this end.</p>
                            <p>Inasmuch as, contrary to what might logically be supposed, it appears
                                that certain American landowners now prefer to change the terms of
                                the agreement, and desire to know the competent authority before
                                whom to make application, I beg to inform Your Excellency that it is
                                the Agrarian Department before which such a petition <pb n="632"
                                    xml:id="pg_632" facs="0642"/>should be filed, and that, since
                                the Chief of the Agrarian Department is at present in Sonora,
                                studying the most expeditious and expedient manner of complying with
                                the Presidential <hi rend="italic">Acuerdo</hi> of the 27th of last
                                    month,<note n="35" xml:id="d627fn35"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_622">p. 622</ref>.</note> he would
                                be the best person to receive that request.</p>
                            <p>However, I wish to draw the attention of Your Excellency to the
                                following points which I have had the opportunity to discuss amply
                                with Mr. Pierre de L. Boal, Counselor of the Embassy, and which I am
                                certain will convince Your Excellency that the American landowners
                                should desist from the action contemplated: <list>
                                    <item>First. In the conference between the President of the
                                        Republic and the landholders of the Yaqui Valley, including
                                        the American landholders, the President made it clear, and
                                        without the slightest protest on the part of the interested
                                        parties, that the small property which the proprietors would
                                        retain would consist of 100 hectares of irrigated
                                        land.</item>
                                    <item>Second. The works of distributing the lands to the <hi
                                            rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi> and of locating the small
                                        properties should be practically completed by now, and any
                                        change of procedure might seriously retard the solution of
                                        the problem and, consequently, to create a situation of
                                        insecurity and of tension which we should for every reason
                                        seek to avoid.</item>
                                    <item>Third. If the American landowners retain lands, which
                                        undoubtedly will not have water, they will feel themselves
                                        defrauded and consider that the Government is leaving them a
                                        useless property.</item>
                                    <item>Fourth. If, as a result of the works on the dam, or due to
                                        any other cause, those 200 hectares, which are now lands
                                        irrigated by rains, should be converted into irrigated
                                        lands, they would again be subject to agrarian affectation,
                                        in excess of one hundred hectares, and therefore would
                                        create new problems in the region.</item>
                                    <item>Fifth. It cannot be assured a priori that it will be
                                        possible to permit each landowner to retain 200 hectares and
                                        still have enough and to satisfy the needs of the <hi
                                            rend="italic">campesinos</hi> entitled to receive lands.
                                        Consequently, by accepting the change proposed, the problem
                                        of the Yaqui region, which it is precisely sought to solve,
                                        would remain without solution.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>In view of the foregoing reasons, the Government deems it necessary
                                to insist upon the expedience of not modifying the arrangement made
                                to the effect that it shall be 100 hectares of irrigated land and
                                not the hectares corresponding to lands irrigated by rains which are
                                indicated as the <hi rend="italic">pequeña propiedad</hi> for the
                                landowners of the Yaqui Valley.</p>
                            <p>As regards the supposition of Your Excellency that the American
                                landowners might challenge the eligibility of the persons figuring
                                in the census list, in order to ascertain whether or not the needs
                                of the <hi rend="italic">campesinos</hi> are entirely satisfied, I
                                should say to Your Excellency that the time for that right to be
                                exercised has now passed and that, <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633"
                                    facs="0643"/>in the present status of this case, it would be not
                                only illegal but highly inexpedient to seek to reopen the
                                controversy concerning the eligibility of the petitioners.</p>
                            <p>The remaining points of your note refer to indemnities for land,
                                animals and equipment, as well as to works on the lands which have
                                been affected.</p>
                            <p>In my conversations of yesterday and today with Mr. Pierre de L.
                                Boal, Counselor of the Embassy, we discussed extensively each one of
                                the details presented by the practical situation, and in those talks
                                I set forth the reasons for the attitude of the Government, which
                                attitude is characterized by the desire to seek the cooperation of
                                the landowners and to obtain promptly an understanding between them
                                and the <hi rend="italic">ejidatarios</hi>, in order to prevent the

                                consequence of the comparatively limited time in which they must
                                dispose of the said lands and because of the limitation placed on
                                the marketing of these lands which cannot be sold to foreigners on
                                account of being within 50 kilometers of the seacoast, it is not
                                believed that the giving of priority to the Americans in the choice
                                of “compensation” lands would be otherwise than fair.</p>
                            <p>As an alternative or concomitant arrangement, it is suggested that it
                                may be practicable for the Mexican Government to offer to purchase

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 5693 of November 18, 1937, enclosing copies of various memoranda
                            dealing with conditions in the Yaqui Valley which were left with Lic.
                            Beteta by Mr. Boal on November 15, 1937.</p>
                        <p>Lic. Beteta said that his information secured from Lic. Gabino Vazquez,
                            the head of the Agrarian Department, was that everything was proceeding
                            smoothly in the Yaqui Valley. However, Lic. Beteta said that it was
                            evident that there was a conflict of information on this subject. He
                            said that he would take up immediately the points mentioned in the
                            memoranda. In principle he saw no reason why the American landowners
                            should not be allowed to select their new unirrigated properties as they
                            deemed best within the area of property available for distribution. He
                            reminded Mr. Boal that the giving of this new land was to be done
                            through a Commission on which the Governor of Sonora would be
                            represented, and said that he would discuss this whole matter with the
                            Department of Agriculture, which was responsible for the new land, with
                            a view to going as far as possible towards helping the Americans in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Boal urged upon Lic. Beteta the importance of reestablishing
                            confidence in the Government among the Americans by promptly <pb n="639"
                                xml:id="pg_639" facs="0649"/>beginning to pay for the work which
                            they had done in preparing the lands which were being turned over to the
                            American farmers and in payment of the agricultural implements. Lic.
                            Beteta telephoned to Ing. Gutierrez Roldán to inquire of the Department
                            of Hacienda regarding the financial situation. He learned from him that
                            he was making arrangements promptly to obtain 400,000 pesos from the
                            Banco National de Mexico; that he was waiting to have this sum in hand
                            to return with it to the Yaqui Valley and to begin payments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Boal suggested that it would be better rather than to wait until all
                            estimates were concluded to begin payments if they would start case by
                            case to estimate the work of preparation of the land and the value of
                            the implements, making payment on each case without waiting for the
                            next. Prompt payments of this description might tend to improve the
                            feeling in the Valley, he thought. Lic. Beteta said that he would
                            recommend this procedure with a view to expediting payment. He said that
                            no doubt where payments were made by Government “pagares” (notes) they
                            could be discounted at once by the recipients at the Banco National de
                            Mexico. He said, however, that the Department of Hacienda had been
                            having some difficulty with the local banks, whose collaboration in the
                            matter they had desired.</p>
                        <p>Lic. Beteta said that he realized that from time to time difficulties of
                            a detailed character might arise and asked that Mr. Boal get in touch
                            with him promptly as these things came up, so that an effort might be
                            made to straighten them out.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                        <p>The Under Secretary stated that he would like to take advantage of the
                            presence in Washington of the Minister of Finance to discuss certain of
                            the problems which are impeding the fullest development of friendly
                            relations between the United States and Mexico. He expressed the thought
                            that the two Governments, since they were both <pb n="640"
                                xml:id="pg_640" facs="0650"/>desirous of strengthening the existing
                            relations, should face frankly and fairly any problems that exist
                            between them and endeavor to settle them promptly and on a satisfactory
                            basis, lest with the passage of time these problems grow to become real
                            issues confronting the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles then stated his sympathy with the objectives of the agrarian
                            program and his interest in learning from Ambassador Daniels from time
                            to time that the administration of President Cardenas had made enormous
                            strides in its execution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles then stated that the policy of expropriation of land and its
                            distribution had, of course, affected many American citizens. A majority
                            of these citizens he thought likewise were sympathetic to the objectives
                            of the agrarian policy but had become antagonistic to the Mexican
                            Government because their land had been taken without real compensation.
                            At this point Mr. Welles stated that the Department was well aware that
                            some American citizens who had gone to Mexico during a previous era and
                            had acquired land for practically nothing and were now faced with
                            expropriation, were claiming fantastic sums for compensation. The
                            Department had no intention of supporting such claims. On the other
                            hand, there were many more citizens who had gone to Mexico in good
                            faith, had purchased lands, had invested their savings and by their own
                            labor and industry had added to the wealth of Mexico by tilling the
                            soil, by installing irrigation works, by erecting processing plants, and
                            by giving new employment to the agriculturists in the regions where
                            their lands were situated. These citizens now saw their lands being
                            expropriated without any effective compensation. Unable to make
                            satisfactory arrangements by direct negotiations with the Mexican
                            Government, these persons were now in increasing numbers appealing to
                            this Government for protection and assistance. Not only were their
                            appeals becoming more insistent but now they were being directed to
                            members of Congress. Mr. Welles indicated that he realized that an
                            airing of the situation in the Congress would not get compensation for
                            American citizens. It would undoubtedly have the effect of seriously
                            impairing the good relations now existing between the two countries. The
                            Department has so far been able to persuade congressional leaders of the
                            undesirability of a public airing of the situation. However, he did not
                            know whether the leading congressmen would remain persuaded unless some
                            measures were taken that would provide relief to the American citizens
                            whose lands were being expropriated.</p>
                        <p>The Minister in reply gave a lengthy detailed exposition of the
                            objectives of the agrarian reform. He likewise elaborated at some length
                            on the determination of President Cárdenas to make agrarian reform a
                            reality during his term of office. Mr. Welles took occasion, <pb n="641"
                                xml:id="pg_641" facs="0651"/>during a pause, to point out that as
                            already indicated there was no difference of opinion between the two
                            Governments with regard to the desirability of improving the lot of the
                            Mexican agriculturists. The exact focus of the discussion was on the
                            compensation of property expropriated which was due under the generally
                            recognized principles of international law, which the Mexican Government
                            espoused.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Suarez at first seemed inclined to attempt on elaborate defense of
                            the right of Mexico to take property without compensation. It was
                            pointed out to him, however, that while he might be able to cite the
                            opinion in support of that contention of one or two international
                            lawyers to the contrary, it was the opinion of the overwhelming
                            majority, supported by decisions of The Hague Court, that while any
                            Government had the right to take property for the public weal it must
                            pay the owners of that property adequate compensation. It was likewise
                            pointed out to Dr. Suarez that from an economic point of view the
                            expropriation of land without compensation had already produced such a
                            lack of confidence that capital had fled Mexico and a currency crisis
                            was now impending. It was further pointed out that for the development
                            of Mexico along the lines which the Mexican Government itself desires
                            vast sums of money would be necessary, sums far in excess of those that
                            Mexico itself could provide. These sums would of course not be
                            forthcoming if capital had no confidence in the security of its
                            investment.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Suarez at the end of this conversation implicitly recognized the
                            validity of the agruments advanced both under international law and from
                            an economic point of view. He stated that he was giving study to the
                            possibility of the issuance of agrarian bonds. This possibility is
                            complicated by the fact that the Mexican Government would not wish to
                            give bonds to the nationals of one country and not give them to the
                            nationals of all the others, as well as to Mexican citizens. He said
                            that the Agrarian Code [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] was estimated at
                            around 700,000,000 pesos. He indicated that upon his return to Mexico he
                            would give renewed thought and effort to finding ways and means of
                            compensating American citizens for expropriated lands.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the discussion of the possibility of a bond issue,
                            it was brought out that the interest of this Government is in real
                            compensation for its citizens.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out to the Minister that the American landowners who have
                            taken up their difficulties with the local national officials of the
                            Agrarian Department have found that the responsible officers are so
                            occupied with a multitude of routine matters that it is often not
                            possible for them to devote detailed attention to their specific cases.
                            The result has been that many American landowners, particularly when
                            they have believed that there have been irregularities in the
                            administration <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0652"/>of the Agrarian
                            Code, have become unnecessarily antagonistic considering that their
                            cases have not enjoyed the full consideration and review that they
                            merit. While the Foreign Office when approached by the Embassy with
                            regard to agrarian cases has always shown the fullest disposition to be
                            helpful, nevertheless the press of other matters is such as to prevent
                            extensive consideration being given to any particular case. The Minister
                            was informed, therefore, that the appointment by the President of some
                            person in his confidence and without other responsibilities to discuss
                            with American landowners the application of the Agrarian Code in cases
                            affecting their properties would be most favorably received by American
                            landowners, as well as by this Government. Both the Ambassador and Dr.
                            Suarez indicated that they saw merit in this idea, and Dr. Suarez stated
                            that he would commend it to the consideration of his Government upon his

                            <p>In the course of the conversation with Licenciado Beteta this morning
                                he mentioned the question of the Yaqui Valley saying that a new and
                                awkward development had arisen there. His Government had promised
                                ours that the American landowners who had lost property there would
                                get free water for their small properties and free water for the
                                land to be given them. The free water in the latter case would be
                                given upon completion of the dam and irrigation works. The Minister
                                of Agriculture now told him that this would practically eliminate
                                revenues from land which in fact belongs to the Government and
                                therefore he did not see how the Government could continue to exist
                                if it undertook to give free water to the Americans. Of <pb n="643"
                                    xml:id="pg_643" facs="0653"/>course they would also have to give
                                free water to the Mexicans and others from whom land had been taken
                                in that area. Licenciado Beteta stated that this created a serious
                                problem which he intended to discuss with the President. He realized
                                that it would be wrong and most prejudicial for the Mexican
                                Government to endeavor to withdraw from its commitment. Instructions
                                had been issued, he said, to the Richardson Construction Company to
                                give the Americans free water and the Company had countered with the
                                proposition that they turn the Company over “lock, stock and barrel”
                                to the landholders and let them run it themselves; the landowners
                                had refused to accept the Company. I pointed out that such a
                                proposition would not be a substitute for the Government’s
                                commitment to provide free water. Licenciado Beteta admitted this.
                                He said that if the Government had to subsidize the Company it would
                                cost the Government about three hundred thousand pesos a year. He
                                also said that there was a difficulty in that the agrarians had to
                                pay for their water and they would be upset if they felt that the
                                Americans were getting their water free. He believed that this might
                                be handled by having the Americans continue as they are doing now,
                                to send them “pagares” (promises to pay) for their water and then
                                instead of the Company collecting these, having them receipted and
                                returned and having the Government make them good to the Company as
                                payment of agrarian indemnity. Some such system he thought might be
                                worked out until such time as the new dam came into operation at
                                which time presumably the whole water system of the Valley would be
                                revised. He remarked that free water to the landowners would result,
                                in a few years, in their having in fact acquired much more value
                                than that of their properties. I reminded him that when he discussed
                                the matter before, the suggestion of free water had been made with
                                the idea that it would be a perpetual right going with the land and
                                would increase the sales value of the small properties and new lands
                                to be given as part compensation of the lands that had been given to
                                the <hi rend="italic">ejidos</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said that assuming that there were forty-six
                                Americans in the Valley with one hundred hectares apiece, and that
                                these lands were worth $100.00 pesos an hectare, the total value of
                                the land would be $460,000.00 pesos whereas the three hundred
                                thousand pesos a year that the Government would have to contribute
                                to keep the water company going represented the interest on around
                                ten million pesos.</p>
                            <p>I told him that I was not in a position to give him any estimate of
                                the sales value of the small properties per hectare. However, it
                                might be that it would be more economical for the Government
                                eventually <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0654"/>to buy these
                                small properties at a fair price thereby solving their water
                                problem. He seemed to think that this might be the case; for the
                                time being he said he would discuss the matter with the President
                                with a view to arriving at an adjustment which would provide the
                                landowners with the free water promised to them.</p>
                            <p>He showed me a map of the Yaqui and pointed out that the only land
                                which could be irrigated by gravity lay to the South West of the
                                present irrigated area and had presumably been given to the
                                agrarians. He said that this dotation was only provisional, and he
                                expected to discuss with the President a readjustment since this was
                                the type of land that had been promised to the Americans in
                                compensation. He would ask, he said, that the Americans be requested
                                by the local representatives of the Company that each one indicate
                                the location of compensation lands they would prefer; they would
                                then see if it would be possible to satisfy them.</p>
                            <p>The reports on conditions in the Yaqui to which he referred during
                                this conversation had been given him by Gutierrez Roldan who has
                                apparently returned from the Yaqui.</p>

                                    of the United States-Mexican Commission Convened in Mexico City,
                                    May 14, 1923</hi> (Washington, Government Printing Office,
                                1925), pp. 53 and 59.</note> the American and Mexican Governments
                            had recognized Mexico’s rights of ownership of the subsoil and at the
                            same time the inherent right to tax petroleum production. He believed
                            that the petroleum companies would fare much better in the future if the
                            Government were a “partner” in the development of the subsoil. With the
                            Government receiving a portion of the production it would have a direct
                            interest in encouraging production instead of withholding it as in the
                            past few weeks. It would also be to the Government’s interest to effect
                            rapid and just settlement of labor difficulties. Under the new decree
                            the Government would give every assistance to the petroleum companies in
                            an effort to secure as large a production as possible. There should be
                            no objection to the new decree as production would increase rapidly. The
                            Government’s royalty would be 10 percent of gross wellhead production up
                            to 1000 cubic meters, 12½ percent from 1000 to 2000 cubic meters, 15
                            percent from 2000 cubic meters payment to be made in petroleum.
                            Royalties are to be applicable to all production from the day on which
                            the decree becomes effective including that from confirmatory
                            concessions. Failure to do as required under the new law will cause the
                            subsoil rights to revert to the Government. It is believed work
                            requirements under the new decree will be applicable to confirmatory
                            concessions but this is as yet unconfirmed.</p>
                        <p>Indications are that petroleum companies are preparing to oppose the
                            signature of the decree as they consider it a heavy burden. The
                            Government’s royalty should run from 4 to 5 million barrels a year. It
                            is not yet definite whether the new decree will apply to the National
                            Petroleum Administration.</p>

                            since from press reports it would appear that the proposed decree will
                            not only deal with royalties but will upset the Morrow arrangement. In
                            order that the Mexican Government may be made aware of our deep interest
                            in the proposed decree, the Department authorizes you, should you see no
                            objection, through informal and friendly contacts with the appropriate
                            Mexican authorities to endeavor to obtain further specific information
                            regarding the nature of the proposed decree and to induce them to
                            realize that any action such as that now rumored the Government is
                            considering taking would probably lead to a revival of the petroleum
                            controversy, which this Government is most anxious to avoid. See

                        <p>184. Department’s 134, July 9, 5 p.m. I have just had a long and entirely
                            informal talk with Beteta and as a result of this have decided not to
                            deliver the letter which I read to Tanis<note n="48" xml:id="d637fn48"
                                >Richard C. Tanis, Assistant Chief of the Division of the American
                                Republics.</note> over the telephone this morning. Beteta believes
                            that the petroleum decree will not be promulgated immediately but may
                            await settlement of the labor controversy between the petroleum
                            companies and their workers. I have arranged that I will give him a very
                            brief memorandum on the morning of July 12, simply pointing out that
                            press reports in the United States have given the impression that the
                            understanding in the settlement of the petroleum difficulties reached
                            with Ambassador Morrow is about to be nullified by a new petroleum
                            decree, and saying that the Embassy, in order to know how such reports
                            might be dealt with would be grateful for information. Beteta will then
                            see the President with a view to obtaining this information. In view of
                            the enclosure to my despatch No. 4993, July 7,<note n="49"
                                xml:id="d637fn49">Not printed.</note> and the information already
                            transmitted in my 179 of July 7 it would be useful if the Department
                            could furnish the Embassy with its views as to the exact scope of the
                            Morrow arrangement. It may be important to determine whether requirement
                                <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0658"/>of a more intensive degree
                            of exploitation in confirmatory concessions under penalty of reversion
                            of subsoil rights to the Government would be considered by the
                            Department to be a breach of the Morrow arrangement.</p>

                        <p>185. My 179 of July 7, 3 p.m., and 184 of July 10, 5 p.m. Beteta asked me
                            to come to see him and told me informally that he had been looking into
                            the situation regarding the petroleum conditions with the Department of
                            National Economy. It appeared that no early legislative action which he
                            would consider as affecting the Morrow arrangement was now contemplated
                            but that administrative action might be taken to obtain a tax or royalty
                            from the petroleum companies and to prevent Mexico from becoming a
                            petroleum “reserve,” that is, to cause the companies to exploit more
                            fully the properties which they hold. He said that in view of this and
                            of his knowledge of the President’s mind he thought it best if I agreed
                            not to take up with the President at this time the subject of my
                            memorandum as reported to the Department in my 184. He said further that
                            he would try to inform me ahead of time if any move for new important
                            legislation in petroleum matters became imminent. I told him that of
                            course I did not wish to ask him to go against his best judgment.</p>
                        <p>He then said he wanted to tell me confidentially of measures which the
                            Government contemplated taking against the Huasteca Petroleum <pb
                                n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0659"/>Company. The Government, he
                            said, intended to proceed against that company for evasion of taxes over
                            several years period and amounting to several million dollars on
                            petroleum from the Cerro Azul fields. The Government would take one of
                            three courses; either (1) what is known as <hi rend="italic">económico
                                coactivo</hi> action which might involve taking administrative
                            possession of the company’s holdings or (2) a regular suit in court
                            subject to <hi rend="italic">amparo</hi>, et cetera, or (3) penal
                            procedure against the company for fraud. He did not know yet which of
                            the three courses will be followed but wanted us to know ahead of time
                            what was contemplated.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Department’s 138 of July 12, 7 p.m., it would seem from the
                            above that it is important to determine whether administrative action
                            (possibly by Presidential “acuerdo”) levying royalties on the companies
                            and penalties (in the sense of my 179) if they do not more fully exploit
                            the properties to which they hold concessions is to be considered as
                            contrary to the Morrow arrangement.</p>

                                Decree To Amend the Oil Law</hi></p>
                        <p>The undersigned American oil companies operating in Mexico come to submit
                            the following state of affairs to the consideration of the Honorable
                            Secretary of State in connection with the above-mentioned proposed
                            presidential decree.</p>
                        <p>If the decree becomes a law, the oil companies will be compelled to pay a
                            royalty upon the oil produced, based on a sliding scale of 10% for the
                            first thousand cubic meters, 12.5% on the next thousand cubic meters,
                            and 15% upon all oil produced over 2,000 meters. This royalty will be
                            collected upon oil produced under confirmatory concessions issued and to
                            be issued under pre-existing laws, as well as upon ordinary concessions
                            issued and to be issued. The oil industry in Mexico is already heavily
                            burdened with taxation, and the additional load of these royalties will
                            make the continuance of operations extremely problematical, especially
                            as the industry is now operating under a price-fixing governmental
                            system.</p>
                        <p>The decree would also authorize the government to force the development
                            of areas held in reserve by private landowners under confirmatory
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>The presidential decree, if enacted, will not only impair valuable,
                            vested property rights held by the undersigned American companies <pb
                                n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0660"/>under pre-existing laws of
                            Mexico and decisions of the Supreme Court of that country, but will do
                            violence to the understanding entered into between Ambassador Morrow, on
                            behalf of the United States, and President Plutarco Elias Calles, then
                            President of Mexico, as well.</p>
                        <p>The legal aspect of the case is without difficulties, and it cannot be
                            contended with any show of reason that the decree would not impair
                            vested property rights of American citizens in Mexico.</p>

                            intention to exploit the oil in the subsoil of the lands, prior to May
                            1, 1917, held vested subsoil rights under Mexican laws, and were
                            entitled to the protection accorded by Article 14 of the Mexican
                            Constitution. Article 14 declares that no law shall be given retroactive
                            effect to the prejudice of anyone, and, in effect, that no one shall be

                        <p>Notwithstanding the agreement with the Obregon government, the Congress
                            of Mexico enacted an oil law on December 29, 1925,<note n="56"

                                December 31, 1925.</note> which would have compelled those holding
                            subsoil property rights acquired prior to May 1st, 1917, to surrender
                            those rights and take in lieu thereof a concession under the oil law for
                            a limited number of years, not to exceed fifty, and subject to the
                            provisions of that law. The issue thus presented was finally adjusted by
                            the intervention of our government, through Ambassador Morrow, who
                            arrived at an understanding <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0661"
                            />with President Calles, in which the principle of the Supreme Court in
                            the Mexican Petroleum Company case was accepted. The decision of the
                            Court in this case was to the effect that the Congress could not limit
                            the landowner’s right in the subsoil to a term of years, nor impose the
                            conditions of the oil law upon him if he had performed the “positive
                            act” mentioned in The Texas Company case prior to May 1st, 1917.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to the agreement entered into with Ambassador Morrow, President
                            Calles obtained from the Congress of Mexico amendments to the oil law of
                            December 29, 1925, by which subsoil rights of surface owners in
                            combustible minerals, acquired prior to May 1st, 1917, through the
                            performance of “positive acts”, were expressly recognized without limit
                            as to time, and the recognition of these rights was to be made through
                            confirmatory concessions issued without cost to the concessionary; and
                            confirmatory concessions to the lessees of the surface owners were to be
                            issued under the law for the full term provided in the leases and
                            extensions thereof, this also without cost to the concessionarys.</p>
                        <p>Many confirmatory concessions have already been issued, but a
                            considerable number of applications have not yet been acted upon. The
                            vested rights acquired in conformity with pre-existing laws and the
                            decisions of the Mexican courts are as valid and binding in the cases in
                            which confirmatory concessions have not yet been issued as they are in
                            those in which they have already been issued. To disregard these rights
                            would not only do violence to the constitutional precepts already
                            referred to, but would constitute a breach of faith upon the part of the
                            Mexican government, which faith was pledged by President Calles in his
                            understanding with Ambassador Morrow. And this goes to that part of the
                            decree which would authorize the government to compel the landowner to
                            exploit the lands held by him in reserve, as an unreasonable
                            interference with property rights.</p>
                        <p>The oil law of 1925 provides for the issuance of ordinary concessions to
                            those who have made application therefor within the time prescribed in
                            the law. No royalty is required to be paid to the government under these
                            concessions, though a royalty of not less than 5% must be paid to the
                            surface owner, as well as such damage as may be caused to his surface
                            rights. Many such concessions have been issued, and a number of
                            applications are still pending. It may be conceded that insofar as
                            ordinary concessions yet to be issued are concerned, the Congress is
                            free to withhold them or to impose new conditions upon them, but the
                            case is not the same when we come to ordinary concessions already
                            issued. In these cases the concessionary has a vested right to the
                            subsoil under the terms and conditions of the law <pb n="652"
                                xml:id="pg_652" facs="0662"/>in force when the right was obtained,
                            which cannot now be impaired without doing violence to the provisions of
                            the Mexican Constitution against retroactive laws and against the denial
                            of due process.</p>
                        <p>We respectfully call the attention of the Honorable Secretary of State to
                            the important fact that the companies we represent, relying on the
                            plighted good faith of the Mexican government, manifested in the
                            understanding between Ambassador Morrow and President Calles, have
                            invested many millions of dollars in the development of their oil
                            properties, and to require them now to accept the additional burden of
                            royalties and other provisions of the decree would not only deprive them
                            of their property rights but would impose upon them heavy financial
                            losses and irreparable injury. We earnestly ask that the Honorable
                            Secretary of State use his good offices with the Mexican government to
                            prevent this act of manifest injustice.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            184 of July 10, 6 [<hi rend="italic">5</hi>] p.m., and to enclose for
                            the Department’s information a copy of a memorandum which I sent to
                            Licenciado Beteta on July 12, and also a memorandum of my conversation
                            with him on July 10.</p>
                        <p>It seems obvious that the Mexican Government is determined to levy a
                            heavy tax on petroleum production in Mexico, to be taken in kind, <pb
                                n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0663"/>and that, anticipating that the
                            companies might restrict their production still further as a
                            counter-move, they expect to couple with this tax provisions which will
                            make it mandatory upon the companies to exploit as fully as practicable
                            the petroleum land which they hold under concession.</p>
                        <p>In effect, the proposed tax—as reported in my telegram 179 of July 7, 3
                            p.m.—is intended to bring about a benefit to the Mexican Treasury
                            somewhat similar to the loan which the Minister of Finance originally
                            attempted to secure from the oil companies, with the difference that the
                            contribution would be a continuing process from year to year.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be no doubt that the Mexican Treasury is in dire need of
                            funds to meet the expenditures incidental upon the Mexican Government’s
                            program of public works, agrarian reform, etc. This primary need of the
                            Treasury is probably the driving force behind the Government’s
                            determination to obtain a greater part of the profits from oil and to
                            make sure that these profits will be substantial.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that this attitude is strengthened by some belief that, in
                            the event the Government should take over oil properties, it can obtain
                            the necessary technicians and advice to enable it to develop the fields
                            and sell the oil, not only in Mexico but also abroad.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican Government is obviously considering accomplishing its
                            objectives by means of administrative measures rather than by new
                            legislation. As a matter of fact, there would appear to be little actual
                            difference between a presidential <hi rend="italic">acuerdo</hi> setting
                            up administrative provisions and a decree-law, except that the petroleum
                            companies, in the case of the former, might have—in theory at least—more
                            legal recourse to the courts for <hi rend="italic">amparo</hi>, etc.,
                            than in the event new legislation is created to govern the situation.
                            (See our despatch 2642 of June 12, 1935<note n="57" xml:id="d641fn57"
                                >Not printed.</note>—last paragraph of enclosure.)</p>
                        <p>As reported in my telegram 185 of July 14, 1 p.m., the Government’s
                            investigation of the Huasteca Petroleum Company in connection with its
                            labor difficulties (see my despatch 4954 of June 26, 1937<note n="57"
                                xml:id="d641fn58">Not printed.</note>) has apparently turned up some
                            indication of tax evasions on products from the Cerro Azul fields.
                            Action against the company is apparently to be taken, and it is
                            conceivable that this may operate as a lever to cause the company to
                            accede to the Government’s wishes in royalty and production matters.</p>
                        <p>It may be of interest to note that yesterday Mr. Bradbury, representing
                            the Gulf Oil Company, through Consul General Stewart made an appointment
                            to call on me today, and at the same time indicated to the Consul
                            General that he understood that the American petroleum companies
                            primarily interested in Mexico were asking the Department to formulate a
                            strong protest to the Mexican Government with regard <pb n="654"
                                xml:id="pg_654" facs="0664"/>to the present position of American
                            companies with interests in Mexico.</p>

                            <p>Following the receipt of the Department’s telegram 134 of July 9, 5
                                p.m., 1937, and after talking with Mr. Tanis at the Department by
                                telephone, I called this morning at 11:30 on Licenciado Beteta at
                                the Foreign Office.</p>
                            <p>I told Licenciado Beteta that the American newspapers had carried
                                stories of the new petroleum decree which I had mentioned to him for
                                some days, but the publicity conveyed the impression that the new
                                decree would alter the state of affairs resulting from the
                                conversations between Ambassador Morrow and the Mexican Government.
                                In view of the large number of American investors in the petroleum
                                industry in Mexico, this report could not fail to have
                                repercussions, and I thought it would be helpful to both Governments
                                if we could know precisely whether the Mexican Government is indeed
                                planning to change this state of affairs and in what way and to what
                                extent.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said that he would speak quite informally and
                                personally, as he usually had in the past. He appreciated, of
                                course, the situation and was, as always, anxious to cooperate.
                                However, the Mexican officials were apt to be very susceptible and
                                might easily draw the inference from any inquiry that our Government
                                assumed some right to dictate the conditions under which the
                                petroleum industry should operate in Mexico, even though nothing of
                                the kind were in mind. They always felt that it was up to them to
                                defend themselves against any charge that they were too open to
                                influence from our Government. He knew, he said, that the President
                                was inclined to feel this way.</p>
                            <p>I said that I understood this difficulty, but that what I had in mind
                                was simply that where the interests of a considerable number of
                                citizens were affected either Government would be interested in
                                knowing what was on the way. Such an attitude was in harmony with
                                the maintenance of good understanding and should operate to prevent
                                the feeling that surprise measures were apt to be sprung at any
                                moment by one Government which might affect its relations with the
                                other. To make my point clear to Licenciado Beteta, I asked him to
                                consider what the reaction here would be if some important <pb
                                    n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0665"/>measure vitally affecting
                                extensive Mexican interests were taken by our Government without the
                                slightest previous knowledge of the Mexican Government. I told him I
                                always assumed that it would be best to envisage difficulties which
                                seemed to be arising before they became acute, with a view to seeing
                                where we were going before irrevocable positions were taken and an
                                issue was created. Relations between the United States and Mexico
                                had improved steadily in the past few years and I thought that
                                everything possible should be done, informally if necessary between
                                the two Governments, to protect the progress achieved.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said that he quite agreed that relations had never
                                been better, and he certainly realized the benefit to both
                                Governments that this situation constituted. However, he doubted
                                whether our Government would be willing to let the Mexican
                                Government know what laws it might have in preparation affecting
                                Mexicans until those laws had actually been enacted. For instance,
                                in the realm of State legislation, he felt that laws which might be
                                contemplated by the Texas Legislature which would affect the status
                                of Mexicans there would never be made known to the Mexican
                                Government until they had become effective.</p>
                            <p>I expressed some surprise at this. I said that both in State
                                Legislatures and the Federal Congress projects of laws were publicly
                                introduced and were available in published records usually for a
                                considerable period before they were enacted. The discussions of
                                these projects on the floors of the legislative bodies was also a
                                matter of public record. Thus, any foreign government had ample
                                opportunity to study the proposed legislation and there had been
                                many instances when such governments had seen fit to present their
                                views on pending legislation to the State Department.</p>
                            <p>I pointed out that in Mexico, however, legislation by decree could be
                                and often was enacted with no knowledge of the terms of the
                                legislation being made public until the law actually became
                                operative. The recent decree nationalizing the railways was an
                                example of this type of “surprise legislation”.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said that he realized the force of the point I had
                                made. He thought, however, that in tariff matters in the United
                                States nothing was known ahead of time and the expression of views
                                of foreign governments was not welcomed by our Department.</p>
                            <p>I said that although I had no recent data, I was under the impression
                                that, informally at least, foreign governments had often expressed
                                themselves regarding tariff questions, and that even discussions of
                                tariff matters had taken place. Tariff adjustments were often the
                                result of public hearings.</p>
                            <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0666"/>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said: what about treaties? Treaties with foreign
                                countries which might affect a third country were often kept
                                confidential until the treaty was promulgated.</p>
                            <p>I replied that in that instance perhaps we were on somewhat different
                                ground, since the negotiation of a treaty involved another
                                country.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said: yes, he realized that treaties were not
                                properly comparable to domestic legislation.</p>
                            <p>He then added that he had never been quite clear in his mind as to
                                just what the Morrow agreement involved and asked what my views on
                                this matter might be.</p>
                            <p>I told him that it was my understanding that Ambassador Morrow and
                                the Mexican Government had been faced with certain difficulties
                                regarding the status of the holdings and operations of the petroleum
                                companies in Mexico in which there was an American interest, and
                                that steps had finally been worked out by which these difficulties
                                were settled on what was supposed to be a definite and permanent
                                basis.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said: yes, that was his understanding, and that he
                                was under the impression that the legislation now being considered
                                would upset this settlement and therefore change the agreement. He
                                himself was in sympathy with such a change. He did not believe that
                                any understanding should be eternal and in the present case it was
                                important, he thought, to prevent the petroleum companies from
                                making a “reserve” of Mexico, instead of exploiting Mexico’s
                                petroleum wealth to its full capacity. He said he had knowledge of
                                an agreement which had been made some years ago in Rurope between
                                the petroleum companies, limiting the amount of petroleum which
                                might be exploited in Mexico. Accordingly, Mexico was being kept as
                                a reserve instead of being developed. This he thought was contrary
                                to the best interests of the Mexican people and steps should be
                                taken to prevent it. He said, however, that he believed the
                                projected oil decree was not immediately to be brought out, but
                                would await settlement of the labor difficulties of the petroleum
                                companies (I presume he meant the investigation being conducted by
                                the Federal Board of Conciliation and Arbitration No. 7, which is
                                supposed to reach a finding by July 29th).</p>
                            <p>He then said that if I would write him a brief memorandum of inquiry
                                based on the press reports, he would take the matter up with the
                                President and would endeavor to put it in such light that there
                                would be no feeling that we were claiming any right to dictate
                                Mexico’s legislation, but rather in the light in which I set it
                                forth to him—to see whether the President would be willing to advise
                                us of what was in mind. He said, rather significantly, that of
                                course the President might be reluctant to give us information on
                                measures which might be changed, thus unnecessarily giving us
                                concern.</p>

                                be promulgated and that this Decree will not be in harmony with the
                                settlement of various petroleum questions reached with Ambassador

                                be helpful if the Embassy were in a position to inform its

                        <p>Mr. Welles spoke to the Mexican Ambassador about the pending petroleum
                            decree when the Ambassador called to say good-by yesterday morning. Mr.
                            Welles informed the Ambassador that we most earnestly hoped that the
                            Mexican Government would take no action with respect to petroleum that
                            would reopen or upset the so-called Calles–Morrow arrangement. In view
                            of his conversation, and in view of Mr. Boal’s comment to me on the
                            telephone July 17 that consideration of the oil decree seems to have
                            been deferred for the moment, Mr. Welles does not believe that the
                            Embassy in Mexico City should be instructed to take any further action
                            vis-à-vis the Mexican Government in this matter.</p>

                                xml:id="d643fn58">Not found in Department files.</note> The
                            Department fully appreciates the desire and need of the Mexican
                            Government <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0668"/>for additional funds
                            and has approached the subject of the proposed petroleum decree with
                            that understanding and with a desire to be as helpful as possible.</p>
                        <p>As the Mexican Government will recall, the petroleum question provoked a
                            bitter controversy which at one stage even endangered the friendly
                            relations between the two countries. After years of fruitless wrangling
                            the two Governments made a new approach to the matter, and with good
                            will on both sides and a desire to settle the matter for all time,
                            arrived at a settlement reasonably satisfactory to the oil companies and
                            in conformity with the Mexican Constitution of 1917 as interpreted by
                            the Supreme Court of Mexico. This longstanding dispute having been
                            interred, the Department earnestly hopes that the Mexican Government
                            will take no action that would reopen it.</p>
                        <p>Although handicapped in considering the proposed petroleum decree because
                            it is not informed of its exact provisions, nevertheless a very careful
                            study has been made of the history that led up to the Morrow arrangement
                            and of the terms of that settlement. It appears to the Department, in
                            all frankness, that a requirement that the holders of confirmatory
                            concessions perform the regular work provided in Article 69 of the
                            petroleum regulations,<note n="59" xml:id="d643fn59"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ley del Petroleo y su Reglamento</hi>, Edición Oflcial de la
                                Secretaría de Industria, Comercio y Trabajo (Mexico, Tallares
                                Gráficos de la Nación, 1926).</note> would unquestionably result in
                            a reopening of the Morrow arrangement. The 1928 settlement included the
                            modification of Article 156 of the petroleum regulations so as to
                            relieve the holders of confirmatory concessions from the requirement of
                            producing the minimum amount of oil mentioned in Article 69.
                            Accordingly, it would appear that, so far as concerns confirmatory
                            concessions they are not covered by the provisions of Article 17 of the
                            petroleum law that “failure to perform regular work in the manner
                            prescribed by this law” shall be a cause for forfeiture of a
                            concession.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, with respect to increasing production the Mexican Government
                            may wish frankly to lay before the petroleum companies holding
                            confirmatory concessions its reasons for desiring an expansion of
                            production and to request their cooperation. If the companies approach
                            the Department regarding this matter the Department will do all it
                            appropriately can to urge them to adopt a cooperative attitude and to
                            endeavor to work out an arrangement which will permit expansion of
                            production on an efficient basis.</p>
                        <p>If the proposed decree will compel the oil companies to pay a royalty
                            upon the oil produced, it would seem that there is good ground, so far
                            as properties held under confirmatory concessions or entitled to such
                            concessions are concerned, to maintain that it would <pb n="659"
                                xml:id="pg_659" facs="0669"/>impair valuable vested property rights
                            held by them under pre-existing laws of Mexico and decisions of the
                            Supreme Court of that country, as well as under the so-called Morrow
                            arrangement. This impairment and violation would arise from the
                            imposition of a condition attached to the rights of the oil companies
                            which was non-existent before they were issued, or became entitled to,
                            confirmatory concessions and thus would result in restricting their
                            previous rights which were confirmed or should be confirmed.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, should the decree take the form of imposing a
                            reasonable tax on the production of oil the matter might assume a
                            different aspect. The purpose of Article 20 of the petroleum law seems
                            clearly intended to include the owners of confirmatory concessions among
                            those covered by the requirement of the article for the payment of taxes
                            “in coin or in cash” as the executive may choose. There is a general
                            reference to the “taxes levied on the petroleum industry,” and
                            discretion is apparently left to the taxing power as regards the nature
                            and extent of such taxes.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you have a full and frank talk with Beteta, or with
                            such other Mexican officials as you believe desirable along the lines of
                            the foregoing. You should not, of course, present these views as the
                            considered judgment of the Department, in as much as the Department has
                            not had the opportunity of studying the precise terms of the proposed
                            decree. However, you may say that the Department has been thinking along
                            the lines above-mentioned and would be inclined to adhere to these views
                            unless the provisions of the proposed decree are divergent from those
                            which the Department understands it now contains.</p>

                            economic condition of petroleum companies presented its report to

                            their interests have always been alien and at times <pb n="660"
                                xml:id="pg_660" facs="0670"/>even opposed to national interest;
                            companies have left in the Republic only salaries and taxes without
                            having cooperated in social progress of Mexico; that majority of
                            companies recovered their invested capital more than 10 years ago; that
                            on more than one occasion they have influenced national events; that oil
                            camps in Mexico are about to be exhausted except Pozarica and El Plan;
                            that exploration of new fields is a great national problem which must be
                            solved, otherwise there is danger that Mexico will be obliged to import
                            petroleum in relatively short period; that Aguila represented 59.33 per
                            cent of total production in 1936 which tends toward monopoly; that
                            prices of products sold in Mexico are higher than those sold abroad;
                            that prices of petroleum products in Mexico are so high that they
                            constitute an obstacle to economic development of nation; that annual
                            average capitalization of defendant companies except Mexican Gulf was
                            164,000,000 pesos during the period 1934–1936; that annual average
                            invested capital not amortized, except Mexican Gulf, was 335,000,000
                            pesos during the period 1934–1936; that average reserves and profits of
                            defendant companies, except Mexican Gulf, during the period 1934–1936
                            was 79,000,000 pesos; that average of profit to capitalization, except
                            Mexican Gulf, was 34.28 per cent during the period 1934–1936; that
                            percentage of profit to capital invested, not amortized, except Mexican
                            Gulf, averaged 16.81 per cent during the period 1934–1936; that profits
                            of Mexican companies are higher than those in the United States; that
                            profits of companies have been extraordinarily lucrative during the past
                            3 years and without prejudice whatsoever to their present or future
                            position, at least during the next few years, they are perfectly able to
                            accede to the demands of the syndicate up to an annual amount of
                            26,332,756 pesos which recommendations of committee would occasion
                            exclusive of retroactive salaries, construction of hospitals, schools,
                            water works, et cetera; that a mixed national commission be established
                            to decide conflicts arising between company and workmen; that a 40 hour
                            week be established on an 8 hour day basis; that 10 per cent of
                            workmen’s salaries be deducted to which companies must place an equal
                            fund for an employees savings fund; that workmen with up to 10 years
                            service should enjoy 21 days vacation annually with pay and 30 days with
                            pay annually for longer term of service; that companies should spend an
                            additional 1 million pesos per year for hospital improvement; that
                            partial, total and death benefits be increased as specified in the
                            report; that pensions be increased as specified in the report; that
                            wages during strike period should be paid and that the minimum wage
                            should be 5.40 pesos a day, whereas minimum offered by companies in
                            effort to settle strike was 2 pesos. Condensed statement of committee’s
                            report being forwarded regular mail today. Companies have 72 hours <pb
                                n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0671"/>in which to answer committee’s
                            statement. Companies feel that report is severe enough but not as
                            unsatisfactory as had been anticipated. Full text of committee’s report
                            will be forwarded promptly.</p>
                        <p>I had an informal conversation with Beteta today along the lines of
                            Department’s telegram 160 of August 2, 7 p.m., of which I am sending a
                            mail report by next pouch. He told me that both Hacienda and Economy
                            felt sure that there would now be no immediate steps taken to bring
                            about objectives of the proposed petroleum decree. However, indirect
                            word has come to Locket from Silva Herzog, financial adviser to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch 5169 of
                            August 4, 1937,<note n="62" xml:id="d645fn62">Not printed.</note> I have
                            the honor to enclose the first eight volumes (in Spanish) of the
                            findings of the Commission of Experts which has been investigating the
                            economic situation of the petroleum companies in Mexico. These volumes
                            have been supplied to the Commercial Attaché by the Huasteca Petroleum
                            Company and further volumes will be forwarded as they appear. As no
                            second copies are available, none are being retained for the Embassy; it
                            is, however, hoped to obtain extra copies later on.</p>
                        <p>The companies have until August 10, 1937, to present their observations
                            on the report of the Commission. They intend to do this, taking
                            exception particularly to the Commission’s statement of profits, which
                            the companies claim to be in the neighborhood of 18,000,000 pesos rather
                            than the 77,000,000 pesos reported by the Commission. They will also
                            take exception to the Commission’s conclusions regarding the role of the
                            companies in the life of the country and to the Commission’s
                            recommendations in the matter of wages and social benefits.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Syndicate is expected to oppose objections to the
                            Commission’s findings and recommendations, advancing claims for
                            considerably more than the 26,000,000 pesos which the Commission
                            considers should be the increased cost to the companies for higher <pb
                                n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0672"/>wages and better social
                            services for the workers. The Syndicate is also expected to object to
                            the number of confidential positions which the Commission’s report would
                            allow the companies to retain.</p>
                        <p>As it will appear from the above, the controversy is likely to drag on
                            for some time to come in hearings before the Labor Board No. 7. In their
                            present mood, it is possible that the strikers will refuse to accept the
                            Commission’s recommendations if they are adopted by the Labor Board, so
                            that the possibility of another strike at an early date is not
                            precluded.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Labor Board will begin consideration of findings,
                            comments, and countercomments during the week beginning August 16th.
                            Copies of the companies’ and the syndicate’s objections will be
                            forwarded to the Department as secured.</p>

                            general strike of petroleum workers in Mexico, which became effective
                            late in May and involved impossible demands, was suspended on June 9;
                            and that the Board of Arbitration and Conciliation, having classified
                            the strike as an economic one, named a Commission of Experts to
                            investigate and report on the question of whether or not the economic
                            position of the oil companies would admit of meeting the demands of the

                        <p>On August 3, 1937 the Commission of Experts handed down their conclusions
                            and recommendations to the Board of Arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The findings and recommendations are of such an arbitrary and impossible
                            nature as that the oil companies operating in Mexico will be forced to
                            cease operations if the Board makes a favorable award based on the
                            Commission’s recommendations. The companies willingly submitted
                            information and disclosed their records to the Commission but the
                            findings are so far removed from the true facts as to constitute
                            absurdities. In other words, it is apparent that the findings of the
                            Commission are not true findings but are clearly arbitrary and distorted
                            without regard to the facts.</p>

                            could continue to exist.</p>
                        <p>As you have perhaps noticed from the press dispatches of today, the
                            companies have filed their answer to the report of the Commission. It is
                            now planned that the Mexico City managers of the companies will arrive
                            in New York early next week to make a full report to their principals
                            and later present the situation to the State Department. To the latter
                            end, our Mr. Thomas R. Armstrong has today arranged for an appointment
                            with Mr. Welles for 11 A.M. Wednesday, August 18, at which time the
                            status of the companies will be fully disclosed. In the meantime, I felt
                            that you would be glad to have this preliminary report of the
                            Commission’s findings and recommendations.</p>

                            Arbitration. It is believed that the petroleum situation is now
                            approaching a very definite crisis and, therefore, the petroleum
                            companies are beginning to prepare a case before the Department of State
                            in anticipation of a denial of justice by the courts.</p>
                        <p>As stated in Embassy telegram number 224 of August 14, 1937, mentioned
                            above, Lockett has secured a copy of the memorandum which will be
                            presented to Mr. Sumner Welles by the representatives of the petroleum
                            companies. A copy is attached hereto, marked number 1,<note n="63"
                                xml:id="d647fn64">Not printed.</note> in order that Mr. Welles may
                            be previously informed of the object of the visit of the petroleum
                            representatives. It is also believed that the conference with Mr. Welles
                            will be utilized to discuss the entire petroleum situation in
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>For the Department’s further information, there is attached a
                                memorandum<note n="63" xml:id="d647fn65">Not printed.</note>
                            prepared for the petroleum companies by Attorney Luis Cabrera, which
                            sets forth the illegality, particularly referring to the Federal Labor
                            Law, of many recommendations made by the Committee of Experts. This
                            memorandum reinforces the claims of illegality as recorded in the
                            general memorandum, marked number 1, which will be presented to Mr.
                            Welles. Attorney Luis Cabrera’s memorandum is attached and marked number

                        <p>Mr. Armstrong stated that the delegation was calling on Mr. Welles to
                            express its concern at the report of the committee appointed by the
                            National Labor Board to investigate the financial status of the
                            companies in order to determine whether the companies could meet the
                            demands of the workers. Mr. Armstrong stated that he could best set
                            forth the views of the companies by reading a letter. Mr. Armstrong then
                            read a letter addressed to the Secretary of State, which he left with
                            the Department.<note n="65" xml:id="d648fn65"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Infra</hi>.</note></p>
                        <p>After Mr. Armstrong had read the letter Mr. Welles inquired of Mr.
                            Armstrong what action the companies desired. Mr. Armstrong stated that
                            the companies hoped that the Department would approach the Mexican
                            Government and inform it of its concern at the apparent intentions of
                            the Mexican Government to impose burdensome conditions upon the oil
                            industry. Mr. Welles replied that the Mexican Government was already
                            aware of the attitude of this Government, and then inquired what else
                            the companies had in mind. Mr. Armstrong thought that we should have the
                            Embassy request that the decision of the Labor Board be deferred until
                            the Department should have an opportunity to study the case. Mr. Welles
                            stated that the President of Mexico was away from the capital, that he
                            did not think that there was anyone there whom we could approach to
                            advantage, and suggested that a representative of the companies in
                            Mexico might be able to arrange it. Finally, Mr. Welles stated that the
                            only ground for action by the Department would be a denial of justice
                            and asked that the delegation turn over to the office of the <pb n="667"

                            brought and discuss the matter with that office. This was done.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned American companies with oil interests in Mexico
                            respectfully make the following representations to the Honorable
                            Secretary of State:</p>
                        <p>In May 1937 a general strike in the oil industry was declared in Mexico.
                            For several months the oil companies had been discussing with the labor
                            syndicates (unions) and government representatives the clauses of a
                            proposed labor contract which would have the status of law governing the
                            entire industry, but no agreement was reached during the period allowed
                            for this purpose. The general strike was suspended on June 9th, after
                            the Labor Board, upon request of the Labor Syndicates, agreed to
                            undertake an investigation of the causes of the conflict, the condition
                            of the industry, etc. This body appointed a commission of experts to
                            conduct the investigation and on August 3rd this commission rendered its
                            summary of finding and recommendations.</p>
                        <p>The report, in its Article 40<hi rend="italic">a</hi>, says “Their (the
                            companies’) financial situation should be classified as extraordinarily
                            lucrative, and therefore, it can be affirmed that, without prejudice
                            whatsoever to their present or future position, at least during the next
                            few years, they are perfectly able to accede to the demands of the
                            Syndicate of Petroleum Workers of the Mexican Republic up to an annual
                            amount of approximately 26,000,000 pesos”.</p>
                        <p>The report then proceeds to outline the various conditions for which
                            provision should be made in the collective labor contracts, including
                            not only the extra financial and other benefits which the commission
                            deems justifiable and necessary, but also plans for setting up
                            innumerable commissions, composed of representatives of labor and
                            capital, with governmental representative as well, with full power to
                            carry on the operations.</p>
                        <p>The companies estimate the extra annual cost of operating under the
                            recommendations as 42,000,000 pesos. The total annual net income of the
                            industry at the present time is approximately 20,000,000. pesos.</p>
                        <p>It has been increasingly apparent that the objective of the Mexican <pb
                                n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0678"/>Government is to take over the
                            oil industry from the foreign companies. Through regulation and labor
                            awards on the one hand and price fixing on the other, the government has
                            followed a consistent policy calculated gradually to increase the
                            burdens on the industry, in order to bring down the value of the
                            properties to a point where the cost of taking them over would be
                            minimized. The process is obviously one of confiscation by slow
                            strangulation.</p>
                        <p>If the economic conditions set forth in the findings of the Committee in
                            its report to the Labor Board should be imposed upon the companies it
                            would place the companies in the position of being absolutely unable to
                            continue to operate and they have so stated in their answer filed with
                            the Labor Board. Further, if these demands were imposed, the law permits
                            successive new demands by the Syndicate of Petroleum Workers at any
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The proposed mixed commission for the petroleum industry and the many
                            sub-commissions would give the Nationals control and would constitute an
                            impossible administrative set-up, since it would eliminate the right of
                            the owners to manage the enterprise. The provisions for disciplining of
                            executives and their ultimate termination would lead to the same end,
                            particularly in view of the fact that under the present law they could
                            not be replaced.</p>
                        <p>The American oil companies operating in Mexico are gravely concerned over
                            the probability that a favorable award based on the Commission’s report
                            will be forthcoming, and cite as basis for their fears the obviously
                            biased report of the Commission. It is believed that this decision will
                            be a repetition of the biased findings of the Board of Conciliation and
                            Arbitration in the case of the Mata Redonda strike of the Huasteca
                            Petroleum Company, which findings were upheld by the Supreme Court. The
                            record of this strike was presented in a memorial filed by the Huasteca
                            Petroleum Company with the State Department on September 21, 1936, and
                            reference is hereby made to the same, because the memorial furnishes
                            proof that the decisions reached both by the Board and the Court were
                            not merely errors of law, but were the reflection of a social bias quite
                            outside the terms of Mexican law, and deprived the Company of its legal
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>The problem is of the utmost concern, not only to the American oil
                            companies directly involved, but to the United States Government as
                            well. If the objective of the Mexican Government is successfully
                            attained, a precedent will be established which may ultimately deprive
                            the United States of petroleum reserves controlled by American nationals
                            in South America and other parts of the world, in the face of limited
                            proven domestic reserves.</p>

                        <p>241. In an informal conversation today Ambassador Castillo Najera told me
                            that in accordance with a conversation he had with Mr. Welles in
                            Washington before he left he had discussed the outlook on the petroleum
                            labor difficulties with President Cardenas yesterday. The President told
                            him that he expected to receive the representatives of the petroleum
                            companies to discuss the situation with them, that he expected to take
                            the entire petroleum situation into his own hands with a view to
                            arriving at an early solution, that he would deal with it in his message
                            to Congress on September 1 and would see Ambassador Castillo Najera
                            again on September 2 to give him a further explanation of the subject
                            which he could give to Mr. Welles upon his arrival in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he was under the impression that an adjustment
                            would be reached with the petroleum companies which would settle the
                            matter, that he thought the companies this time were in fact faced with
                            demands which were economically impossible, and that he appreciated that
                            it would be no advantage to anyone to force a rupture which would result
                            in their withdrawal from Mexico and unfortunate repercussions in the
                            United States. He said that he felt sure the President would find a way
                            to extricate the experts from the difficult position into which they had
                            gotten themselves in their report to the Labor Board so that an
                            adjustment could be reached.</p>
                        <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0680"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that four representatives of the petroleum companies
                            had called upon him this morning at the Foreign Office that he had seen
                            them only briefly as he did not feel that he had any direct connection
                            with the matter and had asked them to reiterate their telegraphic
                            request for an early interview with the President. He said that he would
                            get in touch with me again as soon as he had further information on the
                            progress of the question.</p>
                        <p>While I am sure that he will exercise his influence with the President to
                            bring about an acceptable adjustment, I anticipate that for political
                            reasons the President may have to deal unsympathetically with the
                            petroleum companies in his message to Congress on September 1. I
                            anticipate that if an adjustment is reached between the companies and
                            the Government which will dispose of their labor troubles and tend to
                            establish their progress for the future, the Government will seek to
                            accomplish it on a basis of some early payments by the companies to the
                            Government on account of taxes or on some other score which will help
                            the Government meet its present large commitments.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Castillo Najera spoke with some emphasis of the importance
                            which he and Licenciado Suarez attach to the reestablishment of Mexican
                            credit in the United States.</p>

                        <p>245. My 241, August 28, 4 p.m. President Cardenas received the
                            representatives of the petroleum companies today. He was alone and was
                            apparently expecting a small delegation of one or more with whom he
                            could speak freely. However, all of the local managers of the companies
                            in Mexico City went, some eight or nine, accompanied by Mexican
                            interpreters. The exchange of views was therefore necessarily more
                            limited than might otherwise have been the case.</p>
                        <p>The companies’ spokesman began by setting forth their views that the
                            experts’ recommendations were strongly biased against them and that if
                            they were approved by the Labor Board and placed into effect the
                            companies would have no alternative but to suspend operations. The
                            companies could not afford to exceed the offers they had already made to
                            the workers.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he was much concerned over recent press
                            reports from Mexico to the United States indicating that the attitude of
                            the Mexican Government was calculated to drive out foreign capital. He
                            said that it was the purpose of his Government to see that <pb n="671"
                                xml:id="pg_671" facs="0681"/>both labor and capital were treated
                            justly and that it wanted foreign capital to remain in the country
                            although it intended to see that labor received fair treatment. He
                            remarked that Mexico would only consider buying the foreign petroleum
                            interests as a last resort.</p>
                        <p>He then said that his problems were made much more difficult by the
                            companies’ going for support to the Governments or diplomatic
                            representatives of the stockholders’ countries. He said that as yet the
                            companies had not exhausted their legal remedies and he appealed to them
                            not to go to their Governments or the local representatives of these
                            Governments until such recourse had been exhausted and had resulted in
                            conviction on their part that they had not been accorded justice.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Anderson of the Huasteca told him that the representatives
                            of the companies had gone to New York to consult with the
                            representatives of their stockholders in view of the critical labor
                            situation and determine whether operations should be continued if the
                            Labor Board upheld the experts findings and if the stockholders would be
                            willing to invest additional funds in Mexico if occasion required. They
                            had secured a decision authorizing suspension of operations in the event
                            of an unfavorable decision of the Labor Board and a refusal to consider
                            the investment of additional funds from sources outside of Mexico. The
                            President then said that he intended to take the entire petroleum
                            question into his own hands for settlement; that he wished to have
                            further discussion with the committee of the petroleum companies
                            representatives (the committee which had previously dealt with the
                            President consists of two members only, Beckwith of the Standard Oil
                            Company of California and Van Hasselt of the Aguila. However,
                            indications are that to these two will be added a representative of the
                            Huasteca). The President set noon of September 2nd as the date for his
                            interview with the committee. He said he would have the three members of
                            the experts committee there so that there might be a discussion with
                            them of the situation created by the report.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the interview Anderson set forth the theory that if the
                            Government supported the petroleum labor in obtaining the utmost that
                            the companies could afford to pay it would automatically deprive itself
                            of money for taxes which could be used for the general benefit of all
                            classes of the country instead of for disproportionate benefits to a
                            small number of laborers. Anderson then suggested to him the merits of
                            the excess profits tax in lieu of heavy additional benefits to the
                            petroleum workers. The President replied that he believed that this was
                            a matter very worthy of consideration and that he would give it serious
                            thought.</p>
                        <p>An account of the interview above-mentioned has, I understand, been
                            telegraphed by the local managers to their New York offices. Our <pb
                                n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0682"/>information of it was secured
                            from Anderson of the Huasteca who comments that the President appeared
                            more worried and harassed than he has ever seen him and that the idea
                            that the Governments of the companies might be disposed to support their
                            rights appeared to cause him serious concern.</p>
                        <p>Lockett learned today in confidence from the Comptroller of the Treasury
                            that the Treasury is more than able to meet ordinary administrative
                            expenditures (he calculated that by the end of the year the income would
                            exceed original budget estimates by 100 million pesos). However, the
                            Treasury has been exceedingly hard pressed to meet extraordinary
                            expenditures which have been pledged in connection with the President’s
                            social program. It appears that in addition to having expended all
                            income received to date the Government has borrowed approximately 8
                            million pesos from the Bank of Mexico. In other words, as the
                            Comptroller admitted, there is actually a minimum deficit of 8 million.
                            This year the Government expects to have to fill a gap of from 20 to 25
                            million pesos for expenditures in the Laguna. It is not known how much
                            will have to be spent in connection with the division of lands in
                            Yucatan. At the moment the federal income is diminished due to what the
                            Comptroller called “the abominable handling of the petroleum situation
                            by the Government” and due to the fact as fast as lands are divided the
                            taxes formerly paid to the Government on such lands cease. The
                            Comptroller is going to recommend to the Secretary of the Treasury that
                            the Government closely investigate tax returns of the petroleum
                            companies to catch evasions which he believes exist.</p>
                        <p>Information which we have received from other sources indicates that if
                            the petroleum companies should cease operations which they have already
                            diminished somewhat in prevision of difficulties the Government’s
                            revenue from petroleum sources would drop at least 50%. There are also
                            indications that the companies are certain of controlling all tanker
                            tonnage so that the Government would be unable to market abroad any
                            substantial part of the oil which it might produce.</p>

                        <p>277. President Cardenas received representatives of the petroleum
                            companies on October 18. The delegation was composed of only three men
                            representing Sinclair Pierce, Huasteca, and the Aguila. <pb n="673"
                                xml:id="pg_673" facs="0683"/>The representatives stated that since
                            last November there had been 91 unauthorized strikes in the petroleum
                            industry and that these strikes were demoralizing the workers whose
                            attitude toward the companies and their work was unsatisfactory. They
                            remarked that the experts had emphasized that some companies were
                            selling oil on long term contracts at less than world market prices to
                            their subsidiaries and exhibited to the President documentary evidence
                            to show that this was not being done. Van Hasselt<note n="67"

                                Company.</note> informed the President that if the experts’
                            recommendations were put into effect by the Labor Board the companies
                            would of necessity have to cease operations. He informed the President
                            that conferences held in New York with stockholders had revealed that
                            the latter were unwilling to put any more money into Mexico if the
                            recommendations of the experts should go into effect.</p>
                        <p>As they left the President told the representatives that he would take
                            the situation personally into his own hands and would consult with the
                            experts and with Villalobos<note n="68" xml:id="d652fn68">Antonio

                            done. The petroleum representatives said that the interview left them
                            hopeful but not too hopeful. The above information was obtained from
                            them.</p>

                            from oil company sources. Decree <hi rend="italic">Diario Oficial</hi>
                            November 4th transferred to National Petroleum Administration 350,000
                                <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0684"/>acres of petroleum land in
                            state of Tabasco on which Richmond Petroleum Company (Standard of
                            California) either held exploration contracts or oil leases. On 250,000
                            acres of foregoing General Zuazua obtained exploration and drilling
                            contracts from Mexican Government in 1930 which contracts were later
                            ratified by Presidents Ortiz Rubio and Abelardo Rodriguez and by
                            President Cardenas on August 15th, 1936. Zuazua transferred rights under
                            contract to Richmond Petroleum Company after Cardenas’ ratification and
                            then company applied to Government for transfer approval. Approval was
                            not given and present decree cancelled contract and returned rights to
                            Petroleum Administration. Richmond Company claims it has fulfilled all
                            provisions of contract and has thereunder until December to commence
                            drilling operations. Company also claims it spent 500,000 pesos this
                            year in geological surveys in preparation for drilling. Land title on
                            remaining 100,000 acres was obtained by Mexican Diversified Land Company
                            (American) in 1909 and applied for confirmatory concession about 1926.
                            In 1930 President Portes Gil signed order for concession but President
                            Ortiz Rubio cancelled order. Company asked for <hi rend="italic"
                                >amparo</hi> before Supreme Court against cancellation of order for
                            concession and company won decision in August 1936. Supreme Court held
                            that order for concession signed by President constituted legal act of
                            authority and issuance of concession was only a notification. Company
                            did not receive signed confirmatory concession. Interest of Richmond
                            Petroleum Company in this case due to the fact that it secured oil
                            rights lease on property from Mexican Diversified Land Company in 1928.

                            American companies have made it clear to us that they are asking no

                                >Not printed.</note> American oil companies here feel that Aguila
                            Company and British Government have been cognizant of dealings of Corey

                            probably broken. Indications from Foreign Office and other sources are
                            that American companies <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0685"/>may be
                            faced with difficult situation since as a result of Aguila deal the
                            Government’s attitude with regard to having Labor Board confirm experts’
                            decision seems to have stiffened. There are indications that the
                            Government may be preparing to discuss with Richmond and other companies
                            confirmation of their concession and contracts on the basis of a
                            participation in the oil produced.</p>
                        <p>The Aguila’s arrangement with the Government provides for 12,580 barrels
                            daily to the Government beginning 11 months from now. Presumably the 30
                            or 40 wells to be drilled by the British independent oil group are to be
                            over the territory reserved by the Government for drilling in the
                            arrangement with the Aguila. The independent group agrees to lend
                            $5,000,000 [to] build 3 refineries and 10 coastwise vessels, all funds
                            advanced to be paid from petroleum produced.</p>
                        <p>Local Aguila officials deny all connection with the British independent
                            oil group.</p>
                        <p>There are indications, however, that the British Legation was cognizant
                            of the negotiations both of the Aguila and of the independent oil

                        <p>328. President Cardenas has instructed the special committee that
                            reported the oil companies could pay increased wages of $26,000,000 and
                            the Labor Board, to confer with representatives of the oil companies to
                            go over the figures. There is hope such conference will result in a
                            willingness to reach an agreement as to what increase in wages can be
                            paid.</p>
                        <p>The Government under pressure from Washington in view of financial
                            situation agrees to postpone the whole question until the Supreme Court
                            which has the power to modify the amounts in dispute passes upon the
                            application of the oil companies. It is willing that the bond should be
                            indeterminate and not burdensome on the companies. These concessions are
                            conditioned upon the payment of 1,300,000 pesos in wages. Under the law
                            they say they cannot waive this payment now. Inasmuch as the Government
                            is ready to make the above concessions which it believes is going very
                            far it expects the oil companies to agree to this arrangement. Mr.
                            Beteta tells me the Government cannot and will not go further. Even so

                            recede from the obligations it owes as a Government. If it should do so
                            it would no longer be a Government”. I talked with him after he had
                            attended a meeting with the President and other public officials. He did
                            not disguise his feeling that his Government is acting under pressure
                            applied by our Government at a time when Mexican finances compels
                            Mexican officials to accept what they believe to be hard terms.</p>

                        <p>251. Your 328, December 30, 7 p.m. For the Ambassador from the Under
                            Secretary. The Mexican Secretary of the Treasury came to Washington on
                            his own initiative and has exposed with complete frankness to the
                            Secretary of the Treasury of the United States the critical situation
                            confronting the Mexican Government. He has been received with the utmost
                            courtesy and his representations have been listened to in the most
                            friendly and understanding manner. I informed him personally last night
                            that by order of the President the Secretary of the Treasury would this
                            morning advise him of the willingness of the Government of the United
                            States to purchase immediately 35 million ounces of silver held by
                            Mexico in the Federal Reserve Bank of California and would continue for
                            the time being the arrangement previously entered into for the monthly
                            purchase of silver by the United States Government. He has expressed his
                            utmost appreciation of the friendly attitude of this Government and of
                            this practical evidence of its desire to act as a good neighbor in its
                            relations with Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Under these conditions I am amazed by the impressions given you by the
                            Mexican Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs. There has been no attempt
                            directly or indirectly on the part of this Government to bring any
                            pressure to bear upon the Government of Mexico. The Mexican Secretary of
                            the Treasury himself has stated to me that what is essential in Mexico
                            in order to avert a serious crisis is the reestablishment of confidence
                            and that one of the essential prerequisites of such reestablishment of
                            confidence is the reaching of a fair agreement satisfactory to both
                            sides between the Government of Mexico and the American oil companies.
                            No representations have been made either to the Mexican Ambassador or to
                            the Mexican Secretary of the Treasury with regard to the present
                            controversy between the companies and the Government other than the
                            expression of the hope that an agreement could be reached satisfactory
                            to both sides <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0687"/>which would
                            prevent either a continuation for an indefinite period of the present
                            controversy or a complete cessation on the part of the companies of
                            their operations in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>By authorization of the President and with the complete concurrence and
                            approval of the Mexican Ambassador and of Dr. Suárez, I stated to them
                            that it seemed to me that this is a very appropriate moment for us to
                            discuss all the pending matters between our two Governments with a view
                            to seeing whether an agreement of principle could not now be reached
                            with regard to the distribution-of-water question, the agrarian problem,
                            et cetera, so that the way could be cleared towards reaching in the year
                            to come a satisfactory and friendly understanding between our two
                            Governments on all of these matters. I believe very satisfactory
                            progress has been made in this regard, and I am hopeful that these
                            preliminary conversations may result in future agreements which will
                            make it possible to settle some of these highly controversial matters at
                            a time when such solution is feasible and not permit controversial
                            subjects, such as the water-distribution question, to drag on until a
                            situation is developed in both countries where a satisfactory agreement
                            will be almost impossible.</p>
                        <p>I felt it desirable to telegraph you fully of this situation because of
                            the exceedingly surprising and disturbing implications of the remarks
                            made to you by Beteta. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>253. With further reference to your 328, December 30, 7 p.m. Dr. Suarez
                            and the Mexican Ambassador have just called upon me in order that the
                            former might take his formal leave. I referred in my conversation to the
                            impression you had gained from your interview with Señor Beteta. Both
                            the Ambassador and the Mexican Secretary of the Treasury informed me
                            that there was no ground whatever for any such impression on the part of
                            the officials of the Mexican Government and that if Señor Beteta had
                            received any such impressions as those indicated to you, they could only
                            have been received from the Chairman of the Labor Board. They stated
                            that they had made it especially and entirely clear to President
                            Cardenas and to their Foreign Office that far from there being any
                            pressure applied by the Government of the United States, the position
                            assumed by this Government was entirely friendly and very understanding,
                            and that it had been made evident to them that this Government believed
                            the <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0688"/>controversy between the oil
                            companies and the Mexican Government was one which must be, and should
                            be, settled without any outside interference. They conveyed through me
                            to the President a message from President Cardenas expressing his deep
                            appreciation of the friendly assistance rendered by this Government, and
                            Dr. Suárez himself went out of his way to express his gratitude for the
                            understanding spirit in which he had been received here and for the
                            demonstrations of real friendship proffered by this Government.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Suárez desired to cable President Cárdenas with regard to this
                            matter, but I urged him not to do so in view of the fact that he assured
                            me that any false impression which might have been circulated had now
                            undoubtedly been completely dispelled.</p>

                                    lucrative purposes although for reasons well known to the public
                                    and for a long time it has been operating in a manner which does
                                    not correspond to its nature and there have been created and
                                    rooted vices and deficiencies in the management of the system
                                    which are already endemic and which have delayed the reform of
                                    technical progress of the lines with injury to the economy of
                                    the country and to each one of the users of the service; that
                                    the nature of the company itself has impeded the orientation of
                                    its activities in the sense of procuring primarily social
                                    benefit and for the same reason the Federal Government
                                    notwithstanding its character as principal stock holder has had
                                    to consider the company as a private entity for the purpose of
                                    demanding of it strict fullfilment of legal dispositions.”</p>

                        <p>The Mexican Ambassador called this afternoon at my request. I told the
                            Ambassador that I had always had the happy experience with him during
                            these past two years of being able to take up matters in an entirely
                            personal and unofficial way whenever questions arose which seemed to
                            contain the possibility of creating misunderstanding or friction between
                            the two countries. I told him that the decree of expropriation of the
                            National Railways which had been communicated to the Department by
                            telegram this morning was a matter of very great importance and that
                            certain questions had immediately arisen with regard to the
                            interpretation which should be given to certain features in the decree
                            which I had requested our Legal Adviser to place in the form of a
                            memorandum for my own convenience and that I was going to give the
                            Ambassador, entirely informally, a copy of this memorandum<note n="72"
                                xml:id="d660fn72"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> with the
                            personal request that he let me have a reply to the ten questions
                            formulated therein as early as possible. The Ambassador said he would be
                            glad to do this and would give me an answer as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador agreed with me that it was of great importance that his
                            Government, if it were prepared to give equitable compensation to the
                            American citizens who were stockholders in the Railways, should make
                            that fact doubly plain so that public opinion in the United States might
                            not gain a false impression of what his Government intended to do. He
                            said that Dr. Suarez, the Finance Minister, had called him on the
                            telephone last night and had indicated that he was prepared immediately
                            to negotiate with Mr. Rublee<note n="73" xml:id="d660fn73">George
                                Rublee, representative of the International Committee of Bankers on

                            debt and that he would attempt to bring this to a final adjustment
                            before Mr. Lamont<note n="74" xml:id="d660fn74">Thomas W. Lamont, member
                                of the firm of J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.</note> sailed for Europe on
                            June 30. Dr. Suarez had also told the Ambassador that the shareholders
                            in the Railways would be in a far more satisfactory position as the
                            result of the expropriation decree than they would have been if the
                            Railways had been permitted to continue in their present status.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told me with much satisfaction that Dr. Suarez at the same
                            time had advised him that a decree had been signed refusing
                            nationalization of the religious school in Monterrey and the one known
                            as the Burns school property in Mexico City. I expressed <pb n="681"
                                xml:id="pg_681" facs="0691"/>to the Ambassador my very deep
                            appreciation of the interest which he had taken in this matter and said
                            I knew how happy the authorities of the Catholic Church in this country
                            would be because of the decision taken.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then spoke at some length about his call upon the
                            President this morning, upon the European situation, and expressed for
                            the first time very considerable doubt that the Valencia Government<note

                        <p>The Department of State is informed by the Embassy of the United States
                            at Mexico City that a decree, due to be published today, provides for
                            the expropriation by the Mexican Government of the Mexican National
                            Railways.</p>
                        <p>It is reported to the Department that this expropriation is to be made on
                            the basis of provisions of the Law of Expropriations of November 23,
                            1936, and that it contemplates the expropriation, for purposes of public
                            utility, of all the property of the Mexican National Railways, which
                            will be taken over in conformity with the provisions of Article 7 of the
                            law mentioned. This article provides that if an administrative action
                            for revocation has not been taken, or if such action has been decided
                            against the claims of the appellant, the seizure shall be immediately
                            carried out by administrative authorities.</p>
                        <p>Article 5 of the law provides that the owners of property which is the
                            subject of a decree of expropriation may, within fifteen days after
                            notice to them of the issuance of the decree, resort to administrative
                            action for revocation of the declaration of expropriation.</p>
                        <p>The decree is reported to provide that the properties, when seized, will
                            be delivered to a special organization and that the Secretariat of
                            Communications and Public Works will proceed according to its duty to
                            the effect that, in accordance with the terms provided for in the
                            expropriation law and with the intervention of the Secretariat of the
                            Treasury, “it may fix the amount of the indemnification to which the
                            Federal Government will be subject”. It is reported that the statement
                            preliminary to the body of the decree sets forth that there <pb n="682"
                                xml:id="pg_682" facs="0692"/>are no private interests in the
                            National Railways of Mexico other than those of the foreign creditors of
                            the company “because the amount of those credits evidently absorbs the
                            value of the properties which form the railway system” and, moreover,
                            because “the majority of the stock of the Company belongs to the Federal
                            Government”. The statement is said to continue with the prediction that
                            “the measure will not cause injury to the creditors of the Company since
                            the Federal Government will have to pay them their credits within the
                            limit corresponding to the real value of the properties transferred to
                            the Nation”.</p>
                        <p>Article 10 of the Law of Expropriations provides that the sum which shall
                            be paid in compensation for property seized shall be based upon the
                            assessed valuation of the properties. Exceptions made to this rule are
                            cases of an increase or decrease in the value of the property since the
                            date of the assignment of fiscal value and articles whose value has not
                            been established by the tax offices.</p>
                        <p>It is provided in Article 11 of the law that in case of dispute as to the
                            amount of compensation, apparently in the excepted cases last mentioned,
                            the case shall be taken to the proper court.</p>
                        <p>Article 19 of the law provides that “the value of the compensation shall
                            be paid by the State when the article expropriated passes to its
                            control. When the article expropriated passes to the control of a person
                            distinct from the State, this person shall pay the compensation”.</p>
                        <p>It is provided in Article 20 of the law that “the authority which carries
                            out the expropriation shall fix the manner and terms in which the
                            compensation must be paid, which shall never exceed a period of ten
                            years”.</p>
                        <p>The large investments of citizens of the United States in the Mexican
                            National Railways warrant the Department in displaying interest in the
                            reported expropriation as directly affecting such investments and the
                            Department is desirous of receiving from the Mexican Government a
                            clarification of certain matters apparently involved in the decree.
                            Accordingly, the Department requests to be advised: <list>

                        <p>164. My 161 of June 23 midnight. Indications which I have obtained this
                            morning from Government sources are that the Government’s decision to
                            use the new expropriation law in order legally to take over the National
                            Railways system was arrived at because of the operating conditions of
                            that system which were highly unsatisfactory to the Government. It was
                            felt that not only was the system being operated under conditions which
                            could not but cause great inefficiency but that as a financial venture
                            it was going more and more into the red becoming practically bankrupt.
                            Under these circumstances it was felt logical to apply the expropriation
                            law on the basis outlined to the <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0694"
                            />Ambassador by President Cardenas. (See enclosure to despatch 4171 of
                            December 16, 1936<note n="77" xml:id="d662fn77"><ref
                                    target="frus1936v05#pg_709"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, 1936, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, p.
                                    709</ref>.</note>).</p>
                        <p>The reason for the surprise character of the decree seems to be that the
                            Government was fearful that if any advance notice were given to the
                            National Railways’ workers their powerful syndicate of over 80,000
                            members would attempt to block any such move until they had negotiated
                            their terms of employment with the Government particularly such points
                            as their right to strike. It is felt that while certain concessions will
                            have to be made to them the Government is in a better position to
                            negotiate with them after the <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi>.</p>
                        <p>This morning I had a very informal conversation with Beteta<note n="78"
                                xml:id="d662fn78">Ramón Beteta, Mexican Under Secretary for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> who is a member of the Board of Directors of the
                            National Railways. Beteta said he had his first inkling of the decision
                            to expropriate yesterday evening upon General Hay’s<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d662fn79">Eduardo Hay, Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note>
                            return from the Cabinet meeting. He said that the Foreign Minister had
                            been in no way consulted on the subject; that he was lunching today with
                            Licenciado Suarez<note n="80" xml:id="d662fn80">Eduardo Suarez, Minister
                                for Finance.</note> and would probably see the President very soon.
                            He thought he would then be in a position to give me an estimate of the
                            legal and financial position of the American creditors and stockholders
                            of the railways as a result of the expropriation. It was his own
                            personal opinion that the legal claim of creditors against the
                            Government would be unimpaired by this action but he emphasized that
                            this was a personal view and might turn out to be erroneous.</p>
                        <p>General Mugica<note n="81" xml:id="d662fn81">Francisco J. Mugica,
                                Minister for Communications.</note> this morning informed

                                Attaché in Mexico.</note> that the new status of the National
                            Railways would make for much greater simplification and efficiency in
                            their operation which would be conducted by a commission composed of
                            representatives of the Department of Labor, Communications and Hacienda
                            and the Railways Administration. The Minister stated that while the
                            railways would be taken over under the terms of the expropriation law it
                            was his personal opinion that the stockholders if not the bondholders
                            would be better off than under present conditions.</p>
                        <p>It was also indicated that within 3 months there was a possibility of a
                            further expropriation of a public utility (this is believed to be the
                            telephone companies) and that ultimately the Government might have in
                            mind acquisition by expropriation or otherwise of the radio stations in
                            the country and the Oriente Railway.</p>

                        <p>165. Department’s 121 of June 24, 6 p.m. Beteta expects to see the
                            President tonight and will seek to obtain the desired information from
                            him in order to inform me tomorrow. Suarez has informed Lockett that the
                            question of valuation of the railroad properties is under study and no
                            decision as yet has been reached regarding the method of valuation
                            although he is attempting to secure a fiscal estimate of the value. This
                            presumably means on the basis of their taxable value as provided in
                            article 10 in the expropriation law. Suarez and Mujica are having a
                            conference this afternoon at which time more definite financial
                            arrangements may be decided upon. This indicates that the entire matter
                            is largely in Mujica’s hands. Suarez is leaving tonight for Guadalajara
                            and expects to return June 28th to Mexico City. In the meantime further
                            information will be sought from General Mujica.</p>
                        <p>Suarez said that he felt sure that a satisfactory arrangement could be
                            reached with the bondholders of the National Railroads and added the
                            statement that the outstanding obligations of the railroads would more
                            than exceed the value of the stock and therefore the Mexican Government
                            was only interested in making an arrangement with the bondholders. In
                            other words the stockholders will not be taken into consideration.
                            Suarez asked whether any reaction from the International Commission of
                            Bankers on Mexico had been received and was answered in the negative.
                            Suarez said that the expropriation would have no effect upon outstanding
                            contracts for orders and equipment <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686"
                                facs="0696"/>which would be fully respected and complied with
                            without changing procedure.</p>
                        <p>From the above it appears likely that it will be difficult for the
                            bondholders to obtain even as satisfactory an arrangement as the one
                            last under discussion with Suarez inasmuch as the present action is the
                            first major action under the expropriation law. It is likely that the
                            Government will not wish to establish a precedent of indemnification
                            exceeding that which is contemplated in the terms of the law.</p>
                        <p>Lockett requests that the pertinent parts of this be repeated to
                            Commerce.</p>

                        <p>172. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 121, June 24, 6 p.m. Informal
                            information obtained today from General Mugica is to the effect that
                            valuation for indemnification purposes will be made on the basis of
                            “real value” and not taxable value. Work on estimates of values is still
                            going on and it cannot of course be determined at this time what
                            Government evaluators will consider to be “real value”.</p>

                        <p>180. Mujica advised Lockett today that the Government had not the
                            slightest intention of expropriating other railroads or industries
                            including petroleum industry which will not be expropriated but
                            excepting other public service enterprises (the implication being that
                            public service enterprises may eventually be expropriated) that
                            newspapers saying Southern Pacific, Mexican and Oriente Railways would
                            be expropriated were without foundation.</p>
                        <p>Finance Minister, Suarez, said he spoke for President Cardenas when he
                            said “the President has not in his plans the expropriation of other
                            railways”. Suarez said that the Government would take over the
                            Inter-Oceanico Railway but not through expropriation; the Government
                            would negotiate direct with bondholders on outright purchase basis; that
                            Government now has controlling stock vote in <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687"
                                facs="0697"/>Oceanico and has been offered that railroad for
                            30,000,000 pesos; that he was preparing a statement on National Railways
                            for President Cardenas which will be published first part of next week.
                            In view of reported further expropriations Suarez says he will include
                            in statement assurances of no additional railway expropriations.</p>
                        <p>Suarez also said that he is still in good standing with International
                            Committee of Bankers and had communicated with Committee for renewal of
                            negotiations and that he would settle with foreign bondholders through
                            Committee on basis of recent tentative agreement in lieu of revaluation
                            of properties or diplomatic negotiation with bondholders and that
                            stockholders are wiped out.</p>
                        <p>Department may desire to impart this in strict confidence in appropriate
                            quarters.</p>

                        <p>178. With reference to my telegram 172, June 29, 7 p.m., Beteta who is a
                            member of the board organizing the new autonomous Department of the
                            National Railways has indicated informally that the basis for adjustment
                            with the bondholders is expected to be tentative agreement reached with
                            their representatives a few months ago.</p>
                        <p>However, Lockett also learns from personal letter from Laylin<note n="83"

                            with Suarez. It seems likely that this step will prejudice chances of
                            either favorable or early settlement for railway bondholders.</p>

                        <p>The Department of Foreign Relations of Mexico has drawn up the present
                            Memorandum in reply to the one which Your Excellency was good enough to
                            present to me on the 24th ultimo, with regard to the expropriation of
                            the National Railways of Mexico.</p>
                        <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0698"/>
                        <p>The Department mentioned has considered it advantageous instead of
                            replying, one by one, to the ten questions contained in Your
                            Excellency’s memorandum referred to, to make a general explanation, more
                            effective because of unity and extent, which contains the pertinent
                            details:</p>
                        <p>In the memorandum of June 24th last, the Department of State of the
                            United States of America was good enough to formulate ten questions with
                            regard to the form and conditions in which the Government of Mexico will
                            pay the indemnification for the National Railways, expropriated in
                            virtue of the Decree of June 23, 1937.</p>
                        <p>In order that the American Department of State may get a complete
                            understanding of the matter, the Department of Foreign Relations wishes
                            to explain below what the true situation is with respect thereto, both
                            from the economic and the legal standpoint.</p>
                        <p>The indebtedness of the National Railways exceeds five hundred million
                            dollars ($500,000,000), and according to the most optimistic estimates,
                            the present value of the physical property of the railways does not
                            amount to anywhere near half this sum. Consequently, the holders of
                            stock of the Railways are owners of a negative quantity; the stock has
                            absolutely no value.</p>
                        <p>As can be seen, the Government of Mexico cannot have the intent of
                            excluding them from indemnification, since they are not entitled to any,
                            as the condition in which they are was not caused by the Agreement of
                            June 23rd last and is the same as has been observed for a period of many
                            years.</p>
                        <p>Of the shares of stock representing the capital of the Railways, the
                            Government of Mexico holds the majority, and the Board of Directors
                            named in Mexico City by such majority has already declared its agreement
                            to the expropriation, as well as the express desire not to present any
                            opposition to it. On its part, the New York Board of Directors, which
                            represents the minority of the stockholders, refrained from expressing
                            its opinion on the matter. If the stockholders did have any right, they
                            themselves have voluntarily renounced it.</p>
                        <p>As far as the problem of the valuation of the National Railways is
                            concerned, for the purpose of the payment of an indemnity, it is well to
                            call the Department of State’s attention to the fact that the money
                            value of the Railways mentioned is not known, nor is it recorded
                            anywhere. In virtue of that fact, and in accordance with the provisions
                            of Article 10 of the Expropriation Act of November 23, 1936, the
                            procedure to which recourse must be had in the present case is that of
                            direct valuation; but this does not exclude the possibility of an
                            understanding with the interested parties, for the purpose of fixing the
                            amount which equitably is considered fair for those persons who are
                            entitled to receive any compensation.</p>
                        <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>The problem stated is therefore that of determining who are entitled to
                            indemnification and under what conditions this is to be paid to them. To
                            get a full understanding of this problem it must be recalled that, as
                            this memorandum states, the right to indemnification cannot belong to
                            the stockholders, as the indebtedness is greater than the value of the
                            property. The only persons entitled to ask for compensation of that
                            character are the bondholders. With regard to the latter, the following
                            explanations must be made: <list>
                                <item>First: That the Expropriation Agreement of June 23rd last in
                                    no wise affects the guaranties given by the Government of Mexico
                                    with respect to the indebtedness of the National Railways, and
                                    that those guaranties will be maintained in entirety unless
                                    modified by an agreement made with the said creditors.</item>
                                <item>Second: That whatever the amount of the indebtedness may be,
                                    the indemnification must not be greater than the value of the
                                    National Railways.</item>

                        <p>Taking these circumstances into account, the Government of Mexico is
                            disposed to enter into agreements with the bondholders and has already
                            stated this to the interested parties.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the details requested as to terms, form of making the
                            payment, currency, etc., the provisions of the Expropriation Act do not
                            preclude the possibility of a direct understanding between the
                            Government of Mexico and the persons affected.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Foreign Relations considers that the foregoing
                            explanation answers, in essentials, all the questions formulated by the
                            Department of State of the United States of America in its kind
                            memorandum of June 24th of the current year. With regard to the data
                            requested in case of opposition, the Expropriation Act of November 23,
                            1936, amply covers the points in its Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7. However, as
                            the Government of Mexico believes, with good reason, that the creditors
                            are disposed to reach a settlement, it is to be hoped that the future
                            obligations of the Mexican State toward the holders of bonds of the
                            National Railways may be fixed by mutual consent.</p>

                            agreements so that he might make his counter proposals and then if
                            agreed to by Bankers’ Committee he would sign them immediately. He did
                            not state the nature of his counter proposals. Suarez said that last
                            sentence in paragraph 3 of his telegram meant that delay in consummating
                            agreements was due to Mexican Government’s desire to not sign agreements
                            until it was confident of its ability to fulfill them permanently.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: I had a long conversation with Mr.
                            Rublee on Saturday regarding his debt negotiations. He told me that Mr.
                            Suarez informed Mr. Thomas W. Lamont that he is ready to sign the
                            agreements with respect to the Government funded debt and the railroad.
                            Mr. Layhn [<hi rend="italic">Laylin</hi>] of Mr. Rublee’s office has
                            already gone to Mexico and Mr. Rublee himself intends to leave at the
                            end of this week. Mr. Rublee stated that he intended to see you prior to
                            his departure.</p>
                        <p>In view of the present tight situation in Government finances, it is
                            somewhat surprising to learn that the Government is prepared to sign
                            agreements looking to the resumption of debt service. It is my own
                            belief that this aspect is secondary in the calculations of Mr. Suarez
                            who is so desperately in need of finding funds that he is willing to
                            undertake a commitment to resume debt service in the near future in
                            exchange for receiving a sizeable slice of the $7,000,000 impounded in
                            New York. Mr. Rublee informs me that the Government will receive
                            $1,000,000 at once, and a further participation, depending upon the
                            number of bondholders who assent.</p>

                            their report, the next step to be taken with respect to these claims is
                            that provided for in Paragraph Fifth of the Protocol, namely, the
                            conclusion of a convention by the two Governments for final disposition
                            of the claims. This contemplates a convention providing for an en bloc
                            settlement or reference to an umpire of the cases upon which the two
                            Commissioners have not agreed.</p>
                        <p>In view of the length of time that these cases have been occupying the
                            attention of the two Governments and of the dissatisfaction that has
                            resulted from the delay in disposing of them, which dissatisfaction has
                            been manifested not only by the claimants but by members of Congress, as
                            well as the executive branch of this Government, the Department
                            considers it of the utmost importance that negotiations looking to a
                            final settlement should be undertaken at the earliest possible date. You
                            are therefore requested to take up the matter immediately with the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs and after impressing upon him the importance
                            of bringing the whole claims situation to an early conclusion, inquire
                            whether he is prepared promptly to send a representative to Washington
                            with authority to discuss possible terms of a lump sum settlement. While
                            we prefer that the discussion be held here we will, of course, be
                            willing to send a representative to Mexico City if the Mexican
                            Government insists upon having the discussions held there.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as it is understood that the Mexican holidays begin on the 20th
                            of this month and last until the 1st of December, it will be desirable
                            to have a prompt answer in order that we may make our arrangements
                            accordingly.</p>

                            which have been discussed. If the former the Mexican Government would be
                            unwilling to refer to an umpire cases upon which there has been no
                            agreement and which have not been discussed. In that case they would
                            regretfully consider extension of time provided in the Protocol in order
                            to afford an opportunity for discussion of all claims.</p>
                        <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0702"/>
                        <p>They would prefer, if that is what the Department has in mind, a
                            negotiation, not deriving from the terms of the Protocol, for the
                            purpose of reaching an en bloc settlement of all claims whether
                            discussed or not but excluding the possibility of any reference to an
                            umpire. If the Department’s proposal is for an en bloc settlement or
                            reference to an umpire of only those cases which have been discussed
                            they would agree to this as they are committed to it under the
                            Protocol.</p>
                        <p>Beteta indicated that they hoped the negotiation could take place here
                            because of the expense of sending representatives to Washington, but
                            said that this question could be determined after determination of the
                            scope of the negotiations. My suggestion to him referred only to
                            negotiations in Washington. The idea of negotiation here was not
                            mentioned by me, but was brought forward spontaneously by Beteta.</p>

                        <p>234. Your 306, November 24, 4 p.m. The Department’s purpose is to
                            negotiate an agreement along the lines contemplated by the Protocol,
                            namely, for a lump sum settlement of all claims, or reference to an
                            umpire of cases on which the two Commissioners have not agreed. The fact
                            that some of the claims were not discussed was due to no fault on the
                            part of the American Commissioner, who was prepared and willing to
                            discuss all claims.</p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s desire that the present negotiations should be
                            devoted primarily to a lump sum settlement and, secondarily, to the
                            alternative procedure only in the event that efforts looking to a lump
                            sum settlement shall fail.</p>
                        <p>The Department would very much prefer to have the negotiations take place
                            in Washington and at as early a date as possible. As to the expense to
                            which the Mexican Government refers, you may say that this Government
                            would be willing to adjust this matter in connection with any settlement
                            reached on the basis of joint expenses.</p>

                            Department’s telegram No. 234 of November 26, 1937, 6 p.m., regarding
                            the negotiation of a convention for a lump sum settlement of the general
                            claims, and if necessary for reference of certain claims to an

                        <p>I have the honor to report that Mr. Boal<note n="87" xml:id="d674fn87"
                                >Pierre de L. Boal, Counselor of Embassy.</note> today discussed in
                            the sense of the Department’s telegram this matter with Licenciado
                            Beteta, Undersecretary of State. Mr. Beteta said that he would consult
                            with his legal experts regarding the matter. He indicated that the
                            reference to an umpire of cases which had not been discussed presented a
                            difficult problem for the Mexican Government. Mr. Boal pointed out to
                            him that the primary purpose of the negotiation suggested was to
                            endeavor to arrive at a lump sum settlement, and that doubtless the
                            negotiators could discuss the procedure in the event of failure with a
                            view to seeing what adjustment could best be made regarding
                            non-discussed claims. Licenciado Beteta said that he would be able to
                            give a reply within a few days.</p>
                        <p>He again referred to his preference for having the negotiations take
                            place in Mexico City, and to the expense that would be entailed if they
                            took place in Washington. He estimated roughly that it would cost the
                            Government about 25,000 pesos to negotiate in Washington. Mr. Boal asked
                            whether, if some adjustment on the basis of joint expenses could be
                            arranged, the principal objection to negotiating in Washington would not
                            be over-come. Licenciado Beteta seemed receptive to this idea. He said
                            that in the event of negotiations, they might designate the Ambassador
                            in Washington to conduct them and send technical assistants to
                            Washington to work with him. He was anxious that in that event our
                            negotiator should be of adequate rank to deal with the Ambassador on the
                            understanding that the American experts assigned to work with the
                            negotiator would in fact take most of the burden of daily negotiations.
                            He explained that Licenciado Flores<note n="88" xml:id="d674fn88">Benito
                                Flores, Mexican Commissioner, General Claims Commission.</note> was
                            seriously ill and would not be able to go to Washington in any case.</p>

                            <p>The Ministry feels that the moment has not yet come to undertake the
                                transaction provided for in Article V of the Protocol, since the
                                National Commissioners have not discussed all the claims, which, in
                                accordance with Article IV, must be known (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >considered</hi>).</p>
                            <p>The Mexican Commissioner has always been prepared and willing to
                                discuss all claims and if the two Commissioners found it impossible
                                to do so, then surely it was not their fault; but anyway, it is a
                                fact that a good number of the claims of both countries have not
                                been discussed. Perhaps the explanation of what has happened, as was
                                the case with regard to the functioning of the former Commission
                                whose powers, on various occasions, it was necessary to prorogue for
                                a greater length of time than was initially provided for in the
                                Treaty of September 8, 1923,<note n="89" xml:id="d675fn89"
                                    >Department of State Treaty Series No. 678, or 43 Stat. 1730;

                                        p. 555</ref>.</note> is due to the lack of provision by the
                                Protocol with respect to the period of time necessary to complete
                                their work.</p>
                            <p>However, given the reasons cited by the Department of State, in which
                                this Ministry fully agrees, it is considered most fitting that both
                                Governments make an effort together to agree upon an en bloc
                                settlement by means of an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> transaction,
                                which would thus settle all claims.</p>
                            <p>The Mexican Government considers that said en bloc agreement could
                                not be agreed upon by following the features of the Protocol,
                                because it would be impossible to be confined to them, taking into
                                consideration the provision of Article V, since it would not be
                                possible later to come to an agreement through an arbiter for the
                                resolution of the claims on the bases of each one, as the two
                                National Commissioners could not be required then, for not having
                                had an opportunity to discuss them, to “bear witness to the
                                agreements celebrated by them with respect to each claim and the
                                bases upon which they found their conclusions,” according to the
                                text of said article.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, the Ministry begs to insist upon the understanding that
                                the Government of Mexico, essentially, manifests its conformity to
                                name a representative with ample power to discuss the possible terms
                                of an en bloc settlement on all claims presented before the General
                                Commission, without said transaction being considered as that
                                provided for in Article V of the Protocol of April 23, 1934, but
                                rather as an extraordinary effort (<hi rend="italic">esfuerzo</hi>),
                                not within the terms of said Protocol, to obtain the result
                                abovementioned.</p>

                            memorandum of December 1, from the Mexican Foreign Office. With a view
                            to assisting you in your further negotiations with the Mexican
                            Government, the Department desires to direct your attention to certain
                            phases of the background of the claims negotiations and to indicate to
                            you the reasons for the Department’s feeling that the attitude of the
                            Mexican Government, as explained in its abovementioned memorandum, is
                            unjustified, and for its desire that you procure an agreement to proceed
                            in this matter in accordance with the obligations of paragraph “Fifth”
                            of the Protocol of April 24, 1934.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the Department would suggest that you review the
                            memorandum enclosed with the Embassy’s despatch no. 1626 of June 30,
                                1932.<note n="90" xml:id="d676fn90">Not printed.</note> That
                            memorandum summarizes the negotiations which had taken place between the
                            two governments with respect to the pending claims matters up to that
                            date. An examination of that memorandum, especially from pages 31 to 55
                            thereof, will serve to show you that, at that time, the contention of
                            the Mexican Government was that all of the pending claims, both general
                            and special, should be settled by en bloc agreements; that, in the
                            absence of such agreements, there should be but one further extension of
                            time for the final disposition of all the claims by means of pleadings,
                            and that that period should be limited to two years with a possible
                            extension, in case of extreme necessity, to three years, and that the
                            series of pleadings necessary for the development of the cases should be
                            curtailed as much as possible and that those claims which could not be
                            supported upon the merits should be withdrawn. When negotiations were
                            initiated for the purpose of concluding the agreement of 1934, this
                            Government was, in principle, in general agreement with the Mexican
                            Government in all those points except that with respect to an en bloc
                            settlement of the general claims and in the firm belief that it would be
                            utterly impossible to develop both the general and the special claims,
                            even by a curtailed series of pleadings, within three years. It seemed
                            clear that an en bloc settlement of the general claims, in the then
                            existing state of affairs, was entirely impracticable because it was
                            wholly impossible for either government to have any definite idea as to
                            the extent of general liability of itself or the other government on
                            such claims, and because the Mexican Government was insisting upon the
                            validity <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0706"/>of the numerous
                            so-called Texas land claims,<note n="91" xml:id="d676fn91">Mexico
                                submitted claims to the General Claims Commission for Mexican land
                                grants in Texas which were disallowed by the state of Texas, but
                                nothing came of the claims.</note> amounting to approximately
                            $235,000,000, which subsequent pleadings have shown to be wholly
                            worthless. In that situation, the en bloc settlement of the special
                            claims and the Protocol of April 24, 1934 were agreed upon as the
                            nearest possible approach to the Mexican Government’s demands. That
                            protocol embodied the principles for which the Mexican Government had
                            contended, so far as concerns the matter of pleading the general claims,
                            and, in accordance with its demands, the time allowed for the
                            development of the cases was limited to about 30 months, whereas the
                            time allowed the commissioners of the two Governments for the
                            consideration of the claims, after being fully developed, was greater
                            than the maximum for which the Mexican Government had contended, namely,
                            more than three years. In this connection your attention is directed to
                            the fact that although the protocol was concluded on April 24, 1934, the
                            Embassy reported, on October 13, 1934 (your despatch no. 1845),<note
                                n="92" xml:id="d676fn92">Not printed.</note> that the Mexican
                            Government had decided to “continue” as its General Claims Commissioner
                            Dr. Fernandez MacGregor who was already familiar with the claims work
                            and, presumably, with the hundred or more already pleaded cases, that on
                            October 19, 1934, the American Commissioner was appointed in pursuance
                            of the protocol, and that the final report of the two national
                            commissioners was not filed until the end of October 1937. It is
                            obvious, therefore, that, under the terms of the protocol, the
                            commissioners of the two governments were allowed more than three years
                            for the consideration of the remaining claims, after the cases had been
                            completely pleaded for their convenience, and after the elimination by
                            the two Agents of approximately 1500 claims which they did not consider
                            supportable on the merits.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that in the memorandum attached to your despatch now under
                            consideration, the Mexican Government contends that the failure of the
                            two commissioners to decide more than 1000 of the claims submitted to
                            their consideration was not due to any fault on the part of the Mexican
                            Commissioner, who, it was said, “has always been prepared and willing to
                            discuss all claims.” In connection with that statement there is quoted
                            below, for your confidential information, and for such discreet use
                            thereof as may properly be made with a view to furthering the next step
                            in the proceedings under the protocol of April 24, 1934, the following
                            quotation from a communication of the American Commissioner, Oscar W.

                                realization that the commissioners were about to reach a dead end. I
                                did not, however, let the matter rest with this realization, but
                                subsequently and in fact until June 1937 I sought by deferential
                                suggestion to convey my own impression with regard to the
                                arbitration, which was that the commissioners could reach a
                                substantially successful conclusion if they would continue to make
                                endeavors to reach a common ground for appraising the meritorious
                                cases justly, and I tried to make it clear that I was not disturbed
                                by the fact that there is naturally and historically a peculiar
                                Mexican viewpoint in matters of international law. I suggested that
                                if we should go ahead along these lines, it would become evident
                                that I was willing to recognize the lack of merit of American cases,
                                however large, when they did lack merit; but I hoped for a
                                reasonable showing that those which were meritorious would be
                                recognized as such, rather than be rejected upon points of local
                                municipal law, or those technical but unsubstantial objections which
                                may be made in any case. I asked for suggestions but there was no
                                response. I was forced to the conclusion that present events and the
                                developments of the times are such that conditions are not yet right
                                for a full and free arbitration of these matters between Mexico and
                                the United States.”</p>

                        <p>There is an obvious inconsistency between the above-mentioned memorandum
                            of the Mexican Foreign Office and Mr. Underwood’s statement unless the
                            Foreign Office intended to make a distinction between “discussing”
                            claims and deciding them.</p>
                        <p>It will be obvious to you, moreover, that in the conclusion of the
                            protocol and in the development and submission of the pending claims in
                            pursuance thereof, the wishes of the Mexican Government were fully
                            observed and that the failure of the two commissioners to consider and
                            to agree or disagree with respect to all the claims submitted to them,
                            was apparently due to lack of cooperation on the part of the Mexican
                            Commissioner rather than to any fault on the part of the United States.
                            In this connection it is also worthy of note that the failure of the
                            Mexican Government to cooperate fully in that respect apparently was not
                            due to the fact that the services of its original appointee, Dr.
                            Fernandez MacGregor, were discontinued after approximately one year of
                            the three year pleading period and that a new commissioner was
                            appointed, since it is said by the Foreign Office that the new
                            commissioner was “prepared” at all times to discuss the claims.</p>
                        <p>The objective of the foregoing is to demonstrate to your satisfaction and
                            for your assistance in your negotiations, the fact that there are still
                            pending some 1100 claims, which the two commissioners failed to discuss
                            but wholly without fault on the part of this Government in <pb n="698"
                                xml:id="pg_698" facs="0708"/>the matter of compliance with the
                            theretofore expressed demands of the Mexican Government that the claims
                            be disposed of in a maximum of three years.</p>
                        <p>It is also important for you to have in mind, in connection with the
                            pending negotiations, the fact that paragraph “Fifth” of the Protocol of
                            April 24, 1934 provides that “upon the basis of” the joint report of the
                            two commissioners and “with the least possible delay” the two
                            governments shall “conclude a convention for the final disposition of
                            the claims, which convention shall take one or the other of the two
                            following forms, namely, first, an agreement for an en bloc settlement
                            of the claims wherein there shall be stipulated the net amount to be
                            paid by either government and the terms upon which payment shall be
                            made; or, second, an agreement for the disposition of the claims upon
                            their individual merits.” The report of the two commissioners has now
                            been filed and the obligation of the two governments to conclude the
                            convention called for by that provision of the protocol now
                            unequivocally rests upon them. The memorandum attached to your despatch
                            no. 5811 indicates that the Mexican Government now desires to evade that
                            obligation of the protocol and to proceed to some informal,
                            ex-conventional, en bloc negotiations, without any binding obligation on
                            its part in the matter of the conclusion of an en bloc convention as the
                            only alternative to umpire proceedings on the pending claims, because of
                            the technical contention that since the two commissioners did not
                            succeed in discussing all of their cases, and did not file written
                            opinions in the cases not discussed, it would be impossible, in the
                            event of failure to conclude such an en bloc convention, to continue to
                            the umpire proceedings because there would not be available for
                            submission to the umpire the separate opinions of the two commissioners
                            in the cases not discussed by them. In such a technical contention this
                            Government, of course, cannot in any respect concur. In the first place,
                            the American Commissioner has prepared his opinions in all cases—those
                            not discussed as well as those decided. In the next place, during the
                            pendency of the en bloc negotiations called for by paragraph “Fifth” of
                            the protocol, such opinions are unnecessary and no provision for their
                            use in such negotiations was even contemplated by the protocol. In the
                            third place, if it is the desire of the Mexican Government that such
                            opinions of the Mexican Commissioner be prepared for submission to the
                            umpire, in the event of failure to conclude the en bloc settlement
                            convention, ample time would apparently be available for the filing of
                            such opinions as the umpire proceedings progressed. It could not under
                            any circumstances be conceded by this Government that the failure of the
                            Mexican Government, through its two Commissioners, to cooperate with the
                            American Commissioner in an intensive effort to appraise <pb n="699"
                                xml:id="pg_699" facs="0709"/>the claims submitted to their
                            consideration in compliance with the Protocol obligations, especially
                            under the circumstances outlined above, could constitute any proper
                            basis for contending that the obligations of the protocol have thereby
                            been set aside, and that the two governments are now under the necessity
                            of proceeding to further negotiations with respect to the pending claims
                            released from the obligations of either the Convention of September 28,
                            1923 or the Protocol of April 24, 1934. The Department considers it of
                            great importance to proceed to the conclusion of this long pending
                            matter precisely in accordance with the obligations of the Protocol of
                            1934, which was the result of several months of negotiations, and
                            therefore expects that the Mexican Government will cooperate in the
                            matter of concluding the further convention called for by paragraph
                            “Fifth” of that protocol by first designating a representative to confer
                            with a representative of the United States with a view to concluding, if
                            possible, an en bloc settlement of the claims. If the Mexican Government
                            is prepared to send such a representative to Washington this Government
                            will, as indicated in the Department’s telegram no. 234 of November 26,
                            be prepared to share in equal proportions the expenses of the two
                            governments in that connection.</p>
                        <p>It is desired that you take this matter up with the Mexican Foreign
                            Office in the sense of foregoing, emphasizing the fact that this
                            Government cannot concede that such negotiations have any other
                            character than that of compliance with article “Fifth” of the Protocol
                            and requesting that everything possible be done to bring about the
                            beginning of such negotiations “with the least possible delay.”</p>

                        <p>For your reference, I enclose a copy of Article VIII of the Gadsden
                            Treaty and a translation of the new treaty proposed by the Mexican
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The provisions of the article in the Gadsden Treaty which it is now
                            proposed to abrogate, I am informed, have never been operative, and the
                            article would seem to be obsolete. Its retention is objectionable to the
                            Mexican Government primarily because of the penultimate paragraph which
                            provides for the transit of troops and munitions of the United States
                            across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Mexican Ambassador has
                            informed me that General Cárdenas is particularly anxious to obtain a
                            prompt consummation of the proposed treaty for domestic and political
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>As you will see from the translation of the proposed new treaty, which I
                            enclose, the suggested preamble would appear to be entirely
                            satisfactory, and the sole article other than the usual ratification
                            article is limited to the abrogation of Article VIII of the Gadsden
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I consequently recommend your approval of the proposed treaty as
                            suggested by the Mexican Government. My recommendation to you in this
                            regard is concurred in by the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the
                            Interior, and the Secretary of Commerce, whom I have consulted in this
                            regard. May I have your instructions in the matter?<note n="96"

                        <p>It is observed that the Foreign Office makes no mention of the payment of

                            <p>A brief review of this case is as follows: On June 10, 1934,
                                Sustaita, American born, about twenty-six years of age and a member
                                of the Brownsville, Texas, Fire Department, visited Matamoros with
                                his family and some friends for recreational purposes. Early in the
                                day he had a dispute with Rodríguez and blows were exchanged by the
                                two men. Later, while in a saloon in another part of the city,
                                Sustaita was accosted by Rodríguez, who in the meantime had armed
                                himself, and, after the exchange of a few words, the latter shot
                                Sustaita in the side, the bullet passing through the stomach. The
                                wounded man was taken to a local hospital and later in the day was
                                removed to the Mercy Hospital in Brownsville where he died on the
                                following day, June 11, 1934. Rodríguez, who was also known as
                                Valero, was tried in the Court of First Instance at Matamoros and
                                sentenced to imprisonment for twenty days, to count from the day of
                                his arrest on June 10, 1934, and the court records were transmitted
                                to the Supreme Court at Victoria for review. That Court apparently
                                affirmed the findings of the first instance court, as follows:

                                        Rodríguez is criminally responsible as author of the crime
                                        of homicide committed on the person of Antonio Sustaita. 3.
                                        The penalty applicable to Miguel Valero Rodríguez, as author
                                        of the crime of homicide is that determined by Article 183,
                                        fraction IV of the existing Penal Code. 4. The accused is
                                        favored by the extenuating circumstance of his former good
                                        record and there is no aggravating circumstance (Article 39,
                                        fraction I of the Penal Code). 5. The accused should be
                                        admonished against repetition of the offense. (<hi

                            <p rend="flushleft">It appears that Rodríguez actually spent
                                approximately three months in prison, the jail records showing that
                                he was liberated on September 22, 1934.</p>
                            <p>Would Your Excellency kindly inform me whether Mexican law provides
                                for the reopening of the case against the murderer of Mr. Sustaita
                                which was apparently closed by the decision of the Supreme Court of
                                the State of Tamaulipas, following which the murderer was liberated
                                from prison on September 22, 1934, after spending approximately
                                three months therein.</p>
                            <p>The available data indicate that Rodríguez deliberately armed himself
                                and sought for Sustaita within a short period following their fistic
                                encounter for the express purpose of killing him; that Sustaita was
                                unarmed; and that he was shot down in cold blood. Considering the
                                circumstances, and the shockingly inadequate sentence imposed <pb
                                    n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0713"/>upon the murderer by the
                                trial court and affirmed by the State Supreme Court and the further
                                fact that the victim left a wife and two small children, it appears
                                that the Mexican Government should agree promptly to the payment of
                                a suitable indemnity for the family of the late husband and father.
                                It is felt that the sense of fairness and justice of the Mexican
                                Government will be satisfied by nothing less in a case where, as in
                                this one, there has occurred such a miscarriage of justice.</p>
                            <p>My Government would greatly appreciate an early settlement of this
                                case. I am authorized to inform Your Excellency that my Government
                                will consider the sum of five thousand dollars acceptable as
                                indemnity.</p>

                            <p>This Ministry proceeded to obtain information in the case from both
                                the Government of the State of Tamaulipas and the Ministry of
                                Gobernación, from which information it appears, briefly, that:</p>
                            <p>On June 10, 1934, Valero Rodriguez, of Mexican nationality, employed
                                as a Second Class Officer of the Customs Guard, murdered, in the
                                city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, the American citizen Antonio
                                Sustaita, a fireman of the City of Brownsville, Texas.</p>
                            <p>The corresponding trial having been opened before the Court of First
                                Instance of the said city of Matamoros, the declarations were taken
                                of the witnesses who, it can be said, were divided into two groups,
                                one made up of the friends of the murdered man and the other made up
                                of the friends of the murderer. Following a careful examination of
                                these declarations, the following conclusions are reached:</p>
                            <p>There was a quarrel in which Sustaita roughly struck Valero, who was
                                unarmed. Valero withdrew from the saloon in which this quarrel took
                                place to his home where he washed himself and changed his
                                bloodstained clothing and, after arming himself with his pistol, he
                                returned to the saloon in question where Sustaita still was.
                                According to the friends of the latter and to the murdered man,
                                Valero arrived with pistol in hand and shot him. According to the
                                friends of Valero, the murderer, on seeing Sustaita and fearing a
                                new attack on his part, drew his pistol, at which moment it went off
                                accidentally and wounded the said Sustaita.</p>
                            <p>The Judge who tried the case rendered a decision considering Valero
                                guilty of the crime of homicide, and sentenced him to twenty days’
                                minor arrest, which is the minimum prescribed by the Penal Law. This
                                sentence was carried out because the parties interposed no recourse
                                whatever against it. In accordance with article 409 of the Code of
                                Civil Procedures of the State of Tamaulipas, the Superior Tribunal
                                of Justice of the same State reviewed the sentence in question with
                                a view to determining whether there were grounds for responsibility
                                on the part of the sentencing Judge (<hi rend="italic">para exigir
                                    responsdbilidades <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0715"/>al
                                    Juez sentenciador</hi>), and declared that there were none.</p>
                            <p>The relations of the murdered man did not present themselves during
                                the trial to constitute themselves a party in the proceedings.</p>
                            <p>From the facts indicated above, and with reference to the complaint
                                and request for indemnity of the Embassy of the United States, the
                                following legal considerations suggest themselves (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >se desprenden</hi>):</p>
                            <p>1. Neither the Judicial procedures pursued, nor the sentence
                                pronounced can be reviewed or modified by the administrative local
                                or federal authorities.</p>
                            <p>2. Nor can the sentence be modified by judicial means, because no
                                recourse was interposed against it and it has therefore remained
                                final.</p>
                            <p>3. Also, it is not possible to subject Valero to a new trial because
                                the Mexican Constitution prohibits expressly the trying of an
                                individual twice for the same offense.</p>
                            <p>4. With respect to the complaint of a denial of justice, resolved by
                                the American Government in the form of indemnity in money, and which
                                can be based on the principles of International Law and on the last
                                part of article 32 of the Law of Nationality and Naturalization, the
                                following should be stated:</p>
                            <p>In general, it should be held that it is lawful to consider and
                                accept a case of denial of justice only when such denial of justice
                                causes damage to a foreign individual or State. If this direct
                                damage does not exist, the action of denial of justice should be
                                considered ineffective (<hi rend="italic">ineficaz</hi>), based on
                                the principle that where there is no interest there is no
                                action.</p>
                            <p>In the matter of the administration of penal justice, the failure to
                                impose adequate sanction for the commission of a criminal act upon
                                the person of a foreigner causes no direct damage whatever to the
                                victim of the crime nor to his Nation, because the imposition of the
                                penalty is not based on the satisfaction of individual or social
                                vengeance, nor has it as its object the reparation of the personal
                                or collective harm which the offense may have caused.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, even supposing that it should be admitted that in the
                                present case the penal sanction lawfully corresponding to the crime
                                was not imposed on Valero, since this omission causes no direct
                                damage either to the murdered man or to the United States of
                                America, this Nation lacks the right necessary to justify (or “the
                                legal basis necessary for”) its denial of justice action and,
                                therefore, to resolve this action in the form of an indemnity in
                                cash.</p>
                            <p>Neither could the action in question be based on the general interest
                                derived from the principles of universal justice, because this
                                interest could not go beyond the possibility of demanding personal
                                responsibility on the part of the officials charged with the
                                administration of justice in the State of Tamaulipas in case of
                                failure to comply with their obligations, not applying duly the
                                appropriate legal precepts, <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0716"
                                />for the exercise of this power corresponds exclusively to the
                                Mexican State as a sovereign entity.</p>
                            <p>Now then, along with the penal responsibility of a delinquent, is the
                                civil responsibility which obligates the delinquent to make
                                reparation for the damage caused by the offense which he committed
                                and which is satisfied by the corresponding indemnification of the
                                persons to whom the law grants this right and who in the present
                                case are the nearest relations of the murdered man. Within this
                                concept, since such persons have not presented themselves to
                                exercise their right, it is in order to recommend that they do so,
                                fulfilling all the requirements prescribed by the Mexican laws
                                applicable to the case. If within the judicial procedures that may
                                follow the exercise of this right, there should occur a denial of
                                justice by the courts of the country, after all legal means had been
                                exhausted, then the diplomatic action attempted by the Embassy of
                                the United States would be in order (<hi rend="italic">sí

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your despatch
                            No. 4600 of April 20, 1937, with which you enclosed a note from the
                            Mexican Foreign Office dated April 14, 1937, declining to pay an
                            indemnity on account of the shockingly inadequate sentence imposed upon
                            Miguel Valero Rodríquez, then a Mexican Customs official, for the murder
                            on June 10, 1934, at Matamoros, Mexico, of Antonio Sustaita, an American
                            citizen.</p>
                        <p>As was stated in the Department’s instruction No. 1105 of May 27,
                                1936,<note n="1" xml:id="d681fn1">Not printed.</note> it was felt
                            that it would only be necessary to call the facts in this case to the
                            attention of the Mexican Government, whereupon its sense of fairness and
                            justice would be satisfied by nothing less than the prompt payment of a
                            suitable indemnity for the wife and children of the deceased. Therefore,
                            the Department is surprised and disappointed at the attitude taken by
                            the Mexican Government and is especially surprised at the novel ground
                            upon which the declination was based, namely, that the omission to
                            punish Valero adequately, if it exists, “causes no direct damage either
                            to the murdered man or to the United States of America” and therefore
                            involves no denial of justice. The Department is not aware of any basis
                            in international law for this attitude of the Mexican Government and in
                            this relation refers to the following cases decided by the General

                                    citizen on the ground of a denial of justice arising in part
                                    from the fact that the sentence of two months imprisonment
                                    imposed upon Manuel Robles, a Mexican citizen, for the serious
                                    wounding of Kennedy was “out of proportion to the seriousness of
                                    his crime”. In the course of the principal opinion, Commissioner
                                    Fernandez MacGregor said: “I think that the international duty
                                    which a state has duly to punish those who, within its
                                    territory, commit a crime against aliens, implies the obligation
                                    to impose on the criminal a penalty proportionate to his
                                    crime”.</p>
                                <p>In his concurring opinion, Commissioner Nielsen said: “I think
                                    that enough has been said to justify the conclusion which the
                                    three Commissioners have reached to the effect that the instant
                                    case reveals a denial of justice within the meaning of

                            Department’s instruction 1517 of May 4, 1937, regarding the Antonio
                            Sustaita case.</p>
                        <p>Before Ambassador Daniels left for the United States, he called on
                            Licenciado Beteta, Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, and left with him
                            a brief memorandum, of which I enclose a copy. The Ambassador urged upon
                            Licenciado Beteta the reconsideration of this case with a view to
                            settlement by indemnification, as has been suggested. He informed the
                            Undersecretary that a note expressing very definite opinions of our
                            Government was in preparation. The purpose of this was to afford the
                            Mexican Government an opportunity to meet us halfway in this matter with
                            a view to adjustment before a note further extending legal arguments and
                            fixing positions were delivered. The Ambassador was of the opinion that
                            there was just a chance that if the note were held in reserve for a few
                            days and it were indicated to Beteta that instructions of a very
                            definite character had been received, the latter might see his way clear
                            to finding some issue in the case which would result in early
                            indemnification for the family of Sustaita.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador suggested that a few days after his departure I should
                            call upon Beteta with the Embassy’s note and if necessary give it to him
                            after further discussing the matter. Accordingly, on May 27th I called
                            on Licenciado Beteta and went over the case with him. It became apparent
                            from his entirely cordial but uncompromising attitude on the subject
                            that no progress would be made by withholding the note any longer, since
                            his position was apparently taken in accordance with what he considered
                            to be a fixed general policy of the Mexican Government, of which he
                            approves. I therefore gave him the Embassy’s note 2182 of May 15,
                                1937,<note n="6" xml:id="d682fn6">Not printed.</note> a copy of
                            which is enclosed. I did not feel it advisable to go further into a
                            discussion of the responsibilities of Governments than is indicated in
                            the enclosed memorandum of our conversation without more definite
                            instructions from the Department.</p>
                        <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0719"/>
                        <p>It would be of interest to the Embassy to receive from the Department an
                            expression of its views and of our Government’s policy on this general
                            subject, with the thought that it may be advisable to discuss it again
                            with Licenciado Beteta in the interest of pending and future cases.</p>
                        <p>It may be of interest to note that Licenciado Beteta definitely assumed
                            in his conversation that Foreign Minister Puig had made a request for
                            indemnity in the case of the Cortes Rubio murder. From the Embassy’s
                            records, this does not appear to have been the case.</p>

                            <p>The Foreign Office under cover of its Note No. 33615 of April 14,
                                1937, transmitted to the Embassy of the United States of America a
                                document setting forth the considerations prompting the Mexican
                                Government to decline to pay an indemnity to the family of Antonio
                                Sustaita.</p>
                            <p>As will be recalled, this was a brutal and cold-blooded murder,
                                according to reliable reports, and the family of Sustaita was left
                                in difficult circumstances.</p>
                            <p>It had been hoped by the Government of the United States that the
                                sense of fairness and justice of the Mexican Government would be
                                satisfied with nothing less than the prompt payment of a suitable
                                indemnity for the wife and children of the deceased. In this
                                relation, attention is invited to the payment by the Government of
                                the United States to the Government of Mexico of an indemnity for
                                the killing in 1931 of Manuel Gómez and Emilio Cortes Rubio, without
                                its being necessary for the Government of Mexico to present a formal
                                claim.</p>

                            <p>Pursuant to arrangements made with the Ambassador before his
                                departure, I called today upon Licenciado Beteta to discuss the
                                Sustaita case with him. I took with me the Ambassador’s note 2182
                                    <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0720"/>of May 12 [<hi
                                    rend="italic">15</hi>], 1937, and a copy of his memorandum of
                                May 14th, which the Ambassador has already left with Mr. Beteta. I
                                told Beteta that pursuant to the Department’s instructions we had
                                prepared a note regarding the Sustaita case in answer to their note
                                of April 14 (33615). I said we had hopes that the Mexican Government
                                would see its way clear to adjusting this case before actual legal
                                arguments were entered into on both sides, and it was with this hope
                                that I brought the note personally, with the thought that he would
                                perceive some way to settle the case by payment of a suitable
                                indemnity to Sustaita’s family as had been done in the case of the
                                murder of Cortes Rubio and his companion.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said he did not see what could be done. In his
                                opinion, Puig had made a great mistake when he asked for indemnity
                                for the murder of Cortes Rubio, thereby perhaps giving the
                                impression that the Mexican Government subscribed to the theory of
                                governmental financial responsibility for murders on national
                                territory. In the case of Cortes Rubio, he said, the matter was a
                                little different because the murder had been committed by the
                                police, whereas in the Sustaita case the conflict had definitely
                                occurred between private parties. He said he was in no way
                                attempting to mitigate the failure of justice in the State of
                                Tamaulipas to impose an adequate sentence on Sustaita’s murderer.
                                His Government would continue to seek to have the murderer
                                adequately punished. However, he pointed out, the punishment came as
                                the result of the application of State laws and the Federal
                                Government had no right to interfere in this but could only suggest
                                and exert influence. It was not in a position to take strictly legal
                                steps to bring about the punishment. He said he could not subscribe
                                to the theory set forth in our communications that failure of
                                adequate punishment created a right to indemnity. The two, he said,
                                were separate. Indemnity should be sought by civil action against
                                the person bringing about the damage. It was impossible, he said,
                                that his Government should be made financially responsible for every
                                murder which occurred in Mexico. If the Government should recognize
                                financial responsibility for the death of a foreigner, why not also
                                for a Mexican?</p>
                            <p>I remarked that this did not seem to coincide with the attitude taken
                                in adjusting claims, and Licenciado Beteta said that this was
                                because the claims were for a definite period when revolutionary
                                conditions prevailed. The Sustaita murder, however, had occurred
                                under conditions which might be considered to be normal.</p>
                            <p>I said that personally I thought the Government’s authority and
                                police power in the country constituted a sort of insurance enjoyed
                                alike by nationals and by foreigners when they came into the
                                country. <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0721"/>The foreigner
                                could not contribute to the maintenance of this insurance because he
                                had no voice in the creation of the Government, as a national had. A
                                foreigner coming into Mexico came in the belief that this insurance
                                was adequate to prevent wilful harm being done to him, since the
                                Government’s punishment for such harm was calculated to be
                                sufficient to discourage it. When the Government—and by that term I
                                included the Government of States as created under the Constitution
                                and laws of Mexico, as well as the Federal Government—failed to
                                supply adequate punishment, it materially reduced the insurance
                                against harm to foreigners. The man came into Mexico on the theory
                                that the laws would be applied to protect his life through
                                punishment of murder, and lost his life because such protection was
                                so ineffective as to be held lightly. Through lack of adequate
                                punishment, it seemed to me, he was the victim of a current
                                condition for which the Government of the country was definitely
                                responsible. Responsibility presumably entails financial
                                compensation to the relatives of the deceased.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta said that while he would not disagree with me as to
                                the logic of this, as a practical matter it was not possible for his
                                Government to provide compensations wherever there had been
                                inadequate punishment. What he had said regarding the difference
                                between State and Federal jurisdictions should explain this. I said
                                that in that case there remained only one course to us, which was to
                                present a claim, as indicated in our note. This Beteta said his
                                Government would of course consider when it was received.</p>

                            of an indemnity by the Mexican Government on account of the inadequate

                        <p>It appears from your despatch that the Mexican Under Secretary for
                            Foreign Affairs was entirely unwilling to agree to any adjustment of
                            this matter in advance of receiving the Embassy’s formal note containing
                            the representations directed in the Department’s instruction No. 1517 of
                            May 4, 1937, and that therefore following an interview with the Under
                            Secretary in which that position was taken by him you delivered the note

                            the Foreign Office with a view to the receipt at an early reasonable
                            date of an answer to the note in question.</p>

                                <p>“The rule of the law of nations is that the Government which

                                    subjects, to punish the guilty parties or to give them up for
                                    that purpose, may be regarded as virtually a sharer in the

                            Department’s instruction under reference and pointed out in particular
                            that the Mexican Government’s position seems to have been established in

                            the Department’s convenient reference, a copy of a personal letter of
                            December 8, 1931<note n="13" xml:id="d684fn13">Not printed.</note> from
                            Ambassador Clark to Mr. Herschel V. Johnson, then in the Division of
                            Mexican Affairs, regarding this case.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out quite informally to Licenciado Beteta that if it was the
                            Mexican Government’s intention to change its theory and policy with
                            regard to liabilities of governments, it could not but produce an
                            unfavorable impression to have this change occasioned by the case of a
                            most brutal and cold-blooded murder for which adequate punishment had
                            not been provided. I told him that it would seem to me that if it was
                            indeed as he indicated the purpose of the Mexican Government to change
                            its position from that already stated in its note of November 20, 1931,
                            I thought it would be more fitting if this were done after some
                            adjustment of the Sustaita case has been reached. I pointed out that
                            this would tend to relieve the action of any implication that it was
                            being taken merely for the purpose of avoiding the payment of an
                            indemnity in the case in question.</p>
                        <p>Licenciado Beteta agreed with me that the Mexican Government would stand
                            in a much better light if it could first make the settlement of the
                            Sustaita case and then proceed to define a policy according to its
                            present views. I gathered that Licenciado Beteta had it in mind to
                            outline the policy of the Mexican Government according to his own
                            theories on the subject of responsibility. He said that the principal
                                <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0724"/>difficulty lay in finding a
                            legal means by which an indemnity could be paid without having to take
                            the matter to the Mexican Congress for an appropriation where discussion
                            and possible defeat was to be anticipated. He said, however, that he
                            would study the matter with a view to trying to find some way of
                            adjusting it by an indemnity, and would let me know the result of his
                            studies. The above conversation was, of course, quite informal.</p>

                            in further regard to the possible payment of an indemnity by the Mexican
                            Government on account of the inadequate sentence imposed upon Miguel
                            Valero Rodríguez for the murder of Antonio Sustaita, an American
                            citizen.</p>
                        <p>The Department is unable, on the basis of its present information, to
                            determine whether there exists a valid claim against the Government of
                            Mexico. If such claim does exist it must necessarily be based upon the
                            failure of the Mexican authorities to impose an adequate penalty upon
                            the accused or upon a denial of justice. Whether either of these
                            conditions obtain can only be determined from the record of the court
                            proceedings in the trial of the accused, a copy of which in translation
                            would have to be furnished to the Department. It would be necessary to
                            furnish also copies in translation of the applicable Mexican laws under
                            which the charge was made and the penalty imposed. If the facts as
                            alleged in the trial of the accused are controverted, then an affidavit
                            of the facts as alleged by the claimant should be furnished. It will be
                            necessary also to submit evidence of the American citizenship of the
                            deceased and of the claimant at the time of death and now. This evidence
                            may be in the form of birth certificates or certificates of
                            naturalization or affidavits by two or more persons who have known the
                            deceased and the claimants for a considerable period of time. Finally
                            you will be required to submit evidence of the relationship of the
                            claimant or claimants to the deceased or of any other basis of the
                            claimant’s interest in the matter.</p>
                        <p>If the claimant or claimants care to prepare and submit a case along the
                            lines just indicated, the Department will examine it and inform <pb

                            heretofore taken by the Mexican Government in the premises, as reported
                            in various despatches, the Department may desire to formulate a
                            statement of the bases of its request that an indemnity be paid or to
                            instruct the Embassy concerning the form in which the proofs or evidence
                            should be presented.</p>
                        <p>It seems probable that the Foreign Office is now convinced of the
                            weaknesses of the position it has taken in this case (especially in the
                            light of the Cortes Rubio case) and it is not unlikely that it will now
                            seek to avoid payment of the indemnity on a different basis, i. e., by
                            endeavoring to discredit any evidence presented by the United States
                            Government. If this is so, it is desirable that the best available
                            documentation be obtained for presentation to the Foreign Office.<note

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report upon the
                            present political situation:</p>
                        <p>Except for the activities of those affiliated with the present Government
                            in pushing the organization of a new political party, the <hi
                                rend="italic">Union Nacional Revolucionario</hi>, no other
                            activities have been permitted. In a recent conversation with the
                            secretary of the new party, I was told that there were now enrolled
                            therein 30,000 members. A few days later Dr. Stefanich, Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, told me the number was 35,000. It is very difficult to
                            judge as to the strength of this new organization, whether as to the
                            number of adherents or as to the degree of their loyalty, since it is
                            undoubtedly true that many persons holding Government positions or
                            hoping for favors have nominally affiliated with the new party as a
                            matter of convenience.</p>
                        <p>Although there have been several recent rumors of supposed conspiracies
                            and several former members of the present régime, including Bernardino
                            Caballero, ex-Minister of Agriculture and ex-Minister of Hacienda, and
                            Molas Lopez, former Mayor of Asunción, have been deported and others,
                            including Colonel Caballero Alvarez, Commander-in-chief of the armed
                            forces, removed from their official positions, the situation at present
                            is quieter than at any time since the present régime assumed power and
                            apparently it is more firmly entrenched than ever. However, I am very
                            confidentially informed that the old Liberal crowd, practically all the
                            leaders of which are in exile, is industriously at work in the attempt
                            to overthrow the present régime and expect to make that attempt within a
                            few weeks or months.</p>
                        <p>As long as the army remains united and in support of the present
                            Government, any attempt at its overthrow would seem doomed to failure.
                            Recent rumors have it that there is increasing dissatisfaction among the
                            officials in the army with the present régime. Should a division in
                            their ranks occur it might and probably would result in civil strife,
                            the extent and results of which it is impossible to estimate.</p>
                        <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0728"/>
                        <p>An indication that the Government may not be as confident of popular
                            support as it professes, may be found in its plans regarding the holding
                            of elections. It will be recalled (See my despatch No. 228 of July 18,
                                1936<note n="1" xml:id="d687fn1">Not printed.</note>) that it was
                            expected to hold such elections early in the present year. A few days
                            ago Dr. Stefanich told me that they now hoped to be able to reach some
                            decision in this respect in July or August when the organization of the
                            new party, the <hi rend="italic">Union National Revolucionario</hi>,
                            should have been more completely accomplished and stated: “some want to
                            hold the elections in February of next year, the second anniversary of
                            the revolution,<note n="2" xml:id="d687fn2">See <ref

                            have a bad effect to fix a date and then have to change it”.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion it is my opinion that the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                            will be maintained for sometime yet unless the old Liberal crowd is able
                            to reach at least a part of the army officials in which event
                            interesting times may be expected.</p>

                            to the effect that a deflection of the Valois Rivarola regiment
                            supposedly on duty in the Chaco has returned via Puerto Casado to
                            Concepción which they now occupy. Revolting troops said to be under
                            command of Aaranda. It is said that the movement is not against
                            President Franco personally, the demand being that he dismiss his entire
                            Cabinet and together with two other officers form a military triumvirate
                            to govern the country pending the calling of elections which shall be
                            done within 3 months. The capital is still quiet but pupils have been
                            sent home from school and the various police stations are trying to
                            organize the ex-service men in their respective localities for the
                            support of the Government. It is said that a commission of three persons
                            including a high ecclesiastic authority has been sent to Concepción to
                            negotiate.</p>

                        <p>12. My 11, August 12, 10 a.m. In an interview with Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs this morning he stated that a number of army officers <pb
                                n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0730"/>have been in a state of unrest
                            and that some with their troops are in control at Cosado and Concepción.
                            He maintains that this has nothing to do with Chaco but is being done in
                            conjunction with liberal elements outside the country to prevent the
                            holding of the Eucharistic Congress next week and holds that a
                            successful congress would effectively explode liberal contention that
                            Paraguay is not well run; suppresses religious freedom; and is
                            Communistic. He alleges that the Government is not alarmed and labeled
                            that uprising as a pimple.</p>

                        <p>15. During early morning hours some slight disturbances in the city.
                            Early morning delivery services suspended, streetcars not running,
                            intermittent telephone service, ex-service men being called in and many
                            other individuals in streets being impressed, cars coming into city
                            being searched. At this moment some 200 troops equipped with machine
                            guns are abiding near home of President Franco. Large number of troops
                            just passing Legation en route to center.</p>

                        <p>17. The tension evident here early yesterday has largely disappeared and
                            entire calm prevails. Meager reports would indicate the same situation
                            throughout the entire country. Naval and military officials in this
                            vicinity are apparently acting in concert with the <pb n="721"
                                xml:id="pg_721" facs="0731"/>troops in the Chaco and in the north.
                            Yesterday, they took precautions to prevent the arming of the ex-service
                            men and labor organizations, many of which were violently disposed to
                            support the Government of Franco and it now appears that he has no
                            recourse but to accede to the demands of the navy and army officers,
                            whatever those demands may prove to be. The resignation of the entire
                            Cabinet has been accepted by the President. It is said that the army and
                            navy group desire Franco to remain as President with a cabinet agreed
                            upon by them. No indications of his probable course of action are
                            available. Late last night I talked with a friend who had just left the
                            President and this friend stated that no decision had as yet been made
                            but that it was hoped that a solution would be found during the day,
                            depending upon the agreement of the revolting army leaders in the north
                            whose arrival here is expected momentarily. It is possible that a few
                            days may pass before a solution is reached.</p>

                        <p>19. Department’s 11, Aug. 14, 2 p.m. In my opinion present disturbance
                            here primarily is due to internal politics. However, the Chaco question
                            has been made the football thereof and the overturn may have a bearing
                            upon the Paraguayan attitude.</p>
                        <p>Although I do not believe that the delay of territorial discussions was
                            the motive of the present movement it seems likely that whatever
                            government is formed may attempt to urge the change of government as a
                            pretext for delaying such discussions. It is believed that the present
                            movement was promoted by the old Liberal leaders and their attitude may
                            possibly be reflected in the new government.</p>
                        <p>Until a new government is formed and the personnel thereof known it is
                            impossible to conjecture.</p>

                        <p>[136.] From Braden. Department’s telegram August 14, 2 p.m. In my opinion
                            overthrow of Franco Government was due primarily to older army officers,
                            distaste for governmental inefficiency and wholesale deportations,
                            dislike for the Foreign Minister and to some definite fear that he and
                            the Paraguayan Delegation were bungling the Chaco negotiations. They
                            were egged on by old Liberal Party leaders. A favorable factor is that
                            it appeared likely that Estigarribia and some Liberals will again be
                            influential and to that extent the new government will enjoy greater
                            authority and therefore will be better able to negotiate than the old
                            one. However, I am disposed to expect intransigence from army elements
                            at least to begin with to any territorial settlement involving
                            withdrawal from the present lines of occupation. Paraguay may take
                            advantage of the change to delay territorial negotiations as heretofore
                            but I am confident the new government as soon as established will
                            declare adherence to the protocols.</p>
                        <p>Payva, [<hi rend="italic">Paiva</hi>] former Chief Justice, is reported
                            to have accepted the provisional Presidency. If this is true it would
                            indicate early return to constitutional government.</p>

                        <p>138. From Braden. My 136, August 15, 6 p.m. At best, if only for
                            practical reasons, elections cannot be held for months. Paraguayans of
                            every shade of political opinion have frequently contended that no
                            treaty would be legal in the absence of ratification by constitutional
                            legislature. The new government may insist on that line of reasoning and
                            extend it in an attempt to delay exhaustive territorial
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I submitted at conference session today that recognition is accorded when
                            a government has established internal order and declared its intention
                            to respect the country’s international obligations; furthermore, the
                            request for recognition is in effect that government’s declaration that
                            it is competent to enter into binding international agreements; that
                            government’s competence is acknowledged by foreign powers when they
                            grant [recognition]; therefore, the government cannot capriciously
                            refuse to negotiate and sign a treaty especially when it is foreseen in
                            existing international commitments, i. e., in Paraguay’s case: the
                                protocols.<note n="5" xml:id="d701fn5">The protocols of June 12,
                                1935, and January 21, 1936, signed at Buenos Aires, provided for the
                                solution of the Chaco conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay. See

                            this situation be met by an adequate phrasing of our recognizing notes.
                            My colleagues felt that to do so would be intervention. But it was
                            agreed that the mediatory delegates recommend to their respective
                            governments <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0734"/>that recognition be
                            withheld until the conference has had an opportunity to go into this
                            matter; that recognition when granted be approximately simultaneous and
                            in similar notes.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s views are requested.</p>

                            members of the new government are all quite generally regarded as men of
                            the highest type, level headed and dispassionate.</p>
                        <p>The announced purposes of the new regime are to call elections and return
                            to constitutional government at the earliest possible date. In accepting
                            the presidency, Dr. Paiva stated that he did so for a period not to
                            exceed 6 months. It is nearly unanimous belief that this government
                            intends to and will be able to carry out its announced intentions. As
                            nearly as can be judged the new government has a very substantial
                            measure of popular support and what is of perhaps greater importance
                            there seems to be nearly unanimous support on the part of the army and
                            navy officials. The apparent fact that the new government <pb n="725"
                                xml:id="pg_725" facs="0735"/>is kindly regarded by the
                            ecclesiastical authorities lends an additional element of support. The
                            fact that the overturn was carried out without bloodshed has left the
                            new government free of animosities which might otherwise exist. Although
                            from twenty-five to thirty persons were temporarily detained while the
                            movement was under way, I am informed that all but two or three have
                            been released. It is generally understood that there will be under this
                            government no political detentions or deportation. Under these
                            circumstances and with popular support as well as that of the army and
                            navy it would seem that the new government should be able to maintain
                            itself in power. However, rumors have just reached me that there is
                            considerable dissatisfaction in the army. It is impossible at this
                            moment to express an opinion regarding these rumors or the extent of any
                            dissatisfaction which may exist.</p>
                        <p>From the type of men composing the new government and from the
                            intelligence displayed in effecting the change, it would seem reasonable
                            to suppose that the convenience and necessity of complying with
                            international agreements would be recognized. It will be recalled that

                            conditions for the acceptance of the presidency (see press despatches),

                            fear he may take the position that an interim government such as his
                            cannot sign or even negotiate a final peace treaty. This would prevent

                        <p>Mr. Mackehenie of the Peruvian Embassy called and permitted me to read a
                            telegram which the Embassy had received from the Peruvian Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs. The telegram stated that the Peruvian Government had
                            reason to believe that the recent revolution in Paraguay was connected
                            with the Chaco question and that as a result of the change in government
                            there might be a renewal of the Chaco conflict. The telegram also
                            instructed the Embassy to inquire what measures of consultation the
                            United States Government proposed to take in connection with the
                            recognition of Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>After expressing deep appreciation for the friendly way in which the
                            Peruvian Government had approached this Government, I informed Mr.
                            Mackehenie that the information so far available in the Department did
                            not indicate that the revolution in Paraguay arose out of the Chaco
                            conflict. I stated that it looked as though certain moderate elements
                            which in the past had been disposed towards a settlement might be
                            associated with the Government, which should dispose the Government to a
                            more conciliatory rather than a more belligerent attitude. I then
                            informed Mr. Mackehenie that the Department was instructing Mr. Braden,
                            our Ambassador at the Chaco Conference, to confer with his colleagues,
                            including the Peruvian Ambassador, regarding recognition of the new
                            Paraguayan regime and to report fully to the Department. I stated that
                            in this the Department was following the precedent set in connection
                            with previous revolutions in Paraguay and Bolivia. I told Mr. Mackehenie
                            that I would be glad to get in touch with him as soon as word had been
                            received from Mr. Braden.</p>

                            <p>I wish to lay before the Conference, a question for discussion:
                                Provisional President Paiva, I understand, today in a press
                                interview, declared the new government’s intention to respect
                                Paraguay’s international obligations and to live in amity with its
                                neighbors. This and other information to hand indicates that
                                recognition may shortly be advisable. In this connection, I would
                                recall to my distinguished colleagues that repeatedly, both the
                                delegation headed by Dr. Ramirez<note n="15" xml:id="d710fn15">J.

                                    Zubizarreta,<note n="16" xml:id="d710fn16">Gerónimo Zubizarreta,

                                the fundamental question—would be legal in the absence of
                                ratification by a properly elected legislature. They have even gone
                                so far as to claim that the direct negotiations could not be carried
                                forward exhaustively until a constitutional government was in
                                office. It is this problem which I feel the mediators should
                                carefully consider. If you will bear with me, I first would like to
                                present certain generalizations:—</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Quaere:</hi> Can the government of a country which
                                is illegal according to its own constitution, be bound by
                                international agreements entered into by it? Will subsequent
                                governments of the same country be bound by those agreements?</p>
                            <p>These two questions are answered by the following: <quote

                                spokesmen are accepted and recognized, that same government cannot

                            <p>The United States has, upon occasion, refused to admit that a
                                government claiming to represent the will of the nation represented
                                it in fact. Recognition was then withheld. Such action does not
                                appear likely in the case of the new government. On the contrary,
                                all information, so far received, indicates that the Paiva
                                government is competent to enter into international commitments and
                                may shortly be recognized.</p>
                            <p>Paraguay is an independent sovereign state. Its new government will
                                have come into power, (according to the published statement of

                                army) through the revolution on February 17, 1936, followed by the
                                one on August 13, 1937. The new Paraguayan government, if
                                recognized, will enjoy all the attributes of a sovereign state and
                                these will have been expressly recognized by the mediatory powers,

                            <p>To summarize, recognition by my government will, I believe, be based
                                upon the power of the new government: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) To
                                maintain internal <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0741"/>order, i.
                                e. police and taxing power. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) To carry out
                                the country’s international obligations.</p>
                            <p>It should be kept in mind, as an accepted principle of international
                                law, that recognition of a state is a privilege and not a right.</p>
                            <p>This Conference and the mediatory powers here represented have a
                                peculiar interest and special responsibilities in the question of
                                recognition: (1) For us and for the parties, the protocols are
                                fundamental. The fullfilment and completion of the provisions of
                                those two documents, self-evidently require the enactment of
                                additional agreements; these are, in fact, contemplated in the
                                protocols. Therefore, it might even be alleged that these additional
                                agreements implicitly were authorized by the Bolivian and Paraguayan
                                Congresses when they ratified the protocols. (2) Request for
                                recognition is, in effect, the new government’s declaration that it
                                is competent to enter into binding international agreements. (3) By
                                granting recognition we acknowledge that government’s competence.
                                Hence the new government cannot capriciously refuse to enter into
                                the direct negotiations nor to sign a treaty which will settle the
                                territorial–boundary differences or provide for arbitration of that
                                question; especially is this true when such a treaty is foreseen in
                                existing international commitments, i. e. in Paraguay’s case: the
                                Protocols.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, although I have not consulted on the matter with my
                                government, in the cause of peace, and in order to avoid future
                                obstacles being placed in our path, to comply with our
                                responsibilities as mediators, and in short, to insure the success
                                of our undertaking, I submit for the consideration of my fellow
                                delegates that if, as now appears likely, we decide that the new
                                Paraguayan government should be recognized, that we then adopt the
                                procedure followed in the two recognitions according during 1936,
                                that is to say, each of the mediatory powers, more or less
                                simultaneously, present similar notes to the new government, and
                                that in these notes there be included a phrasing which will
                                condition our recognition not only on the new government’s declared
                                intention of respecting its international obligations but also upon
                                the new government’s recognizing itself to be competent to carry out
                                its obligations, to enter direct negotiations, and to fullfill the
                                provisions of the Protocols by entering into other binding
                                agreements. Nothing in this procedure would prevent a subsequent
                                ratification of the new agreements by a congress, when elected, if
                                either one or both of the parties so desired.</p>
                            <p>Mr. President, I have not made the foregoing statement as a
                                declaration of policy. I am not proposing a thesis but simply place
                                the matter before the Conference in the belief that advantage may be
                                taken of the situation so to phrase our respective notes of
                                recognition <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0742"/>as to forward
                                the attainment of our objectives. Needless to say, the injection of
                                this delicate subject into our notes of recognition must be done
                                skillfully and carefully.</p>

                        <p>144. From Braden. Your 73, August 18, 7 p.m. I wish to reassure the
                            Department that the suggestion I made last Monday to the Conference made
                            clear that I was not speaking for my Government nor proposing a policy
                            but simply bringing the matter up for consideration. Copy of statement
                            air mailed today.</p>
                        <p>The usual declaration to the effect that all international obligations
                            will be observed would leave an opening for Paraguay to contend that
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) direct negotiations and a final treaty
                            could only be effected by a constitutionally elected government; (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) the January 9 bases and the regulations are
                            illegal. Such a stand would leave the Conference in a hiatus for several
                            months and would be definitely disturbing in Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>Under the best of circumstances we may expect a continuation of the
                            Paraguayan policy of delay but if the suggestion of the Argentine
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, reported in my telegram 143, August 18, 7
                            p.m., is accepted, adequate precautions will have been taken and the
                            question of phrasing will not arise. Before going further into the
                            matter I believe it wise first to learn the Paraguayan reaction to the
                            Foreign Minister’s suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Does the Department approve of approximately simultaneous and similar
                            notes of recognition? I will telegraph my colleagues’ views as soon as
                            they are defined and any suggested draft. [Braden.]</p>

                            procedure mentioned in the last paragraph of your 144, August 19, 6 p.m.
                            However, the American Minister at Asuncion has reported that the
                            Brazilian Minister extended the recognition of his Government on August
                            19. No communication regarding recognition has as yet been received at
                            the Department from the Paraguayan Minister in Washington. Please
                            continue to keep the Department informed by telegram regarding

                        <p>At my request the Paraguayan Minister called. I told the Minister that
                            several of the new cabinet members were not known well to the Department
                            and that I would appreciate anything he would care to say regarding the
                            new Government.</p>
                        <p>Señor Busk Codas stated that he knew well and favorably the new
                            President, Dr. Paiva, and Doctors Cecilio Baez, the new Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs, and Dr. Argaña, the new Minister of Public Instruction.
                            The first two, Dr. Paiva and Dr. Baez, are of considerable experience in
                            government but have been retired from political life for some time. He
                            thought that they would probably give the tone to the administration and
                            if his belief is correct the Government will be decidedly conservative.
                            The only objection to Drs. Paiva and Baez would be their age. The other
                            men in the Cabinet who Señor Busk Codas knows, have good
                            reputations.</p>
                        <p>Señor Busk Codas stated that Dr. Paiva followed the opposition to Dr.
                            Ayala at the time the split in the Liberal Party occurred in 1923. He is
                            married to a sister of ex-President Schaerer. The Minister doubted,
                            however, whether this fact meant that the new government <pb n="734"
                                xml:id="pg_734" facs="0744"/>would be opposed to Dr. Ayala and his
                            faction, because Dr. Paiva has been out of politics for so many
                            years.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            Bolivian press has been most guarded in its references to the overthrow
                            of the Franco Junta in Paraguay and has done little more than to publish
                            Associated Press and United Press releases reporting the course of
                            events in Paraguay. This cautiousness reflects the uncertainty existing
                            in Bolivian Government circles as to what effect the change in the
                            administration may have on the course of the Chaco peace negotiations.
                            Bolivia anxiously awaits indications of the attitude of the new
                            Paraguayan regime towards the Chaco problem.</p>
                        <p>The Sub-Secretary of Foreign Relations mentioned to me he feared that one
                            of the main causes of the change was the desire of Paraguay to liberate
                            itself from the commitments made by the Ayala and Franco governments
                            respecting the Chaco and that the leader of the movement is known to be
                            most obdurate against any concessions by Paraguay that might make an
                            agreement possible. Mr. Anze Matienzo reminded me that one of the very
                            first acts of Colonel Busch upon assuming the Provisional Presidency was
                            to communicate to the Chaco Peace Conference his intention of abiding
                            fully by the provisions of the Protocols. This had been done primarily
                            with the hope that it might be a precedent to any change of regime in
                            Paraguay.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">La Razón</hi> of August 17th editorially pointed out
                            that the change in regime brought up three aspects: 1. To know whether
                            or not the new government will respect existing treaties; 2. to know in
                            what sense the new regime will hurry to regularize its relations with
                            the Buenos Aires Peace Conference; 3., and, finally, to define in what
                            measure the attitude of the army can exercise a control over the
                            ex-combatant elements which, under the overthrown government, showed
                            themselves stubborn to all pacific understanding. A copy and
                                translation<note n="18" xml:id="d715fn18">Not printed.</note> of

                        <p><hi rend="italic">El Diario</hi> of August 18th reported that during a
                            press interview Dr. Fabian Vaca Chávez, Bolivian Minister of Foreign
                            Relations, <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0745"/>called attention to
                            an article in the <hi rend="italic">Crítica</hi>, of Buenos Aires, in
                            which mention was made that Lt. Colonel Ramón L. Paredes, head of the
                            August 13th revolution, was the chief of the garrison in the Chaco who
                            refused to recognize the orders of Colonel Franco in connection with
                            putting into effect the regulations governing the zone of separation.
                            Dr. Vaca Chávez is reported to have commented that no official
                            information had been received as to the attitude of the new government
                            on international matters, but that the attitude of Lt. Colonel Paredes
                            brought up a question which should be dispelled at the earliest
                            opportunity.</p>

                                    revolution was directed especially against the international
                                    politics of Franco and Chancellor Stefanich, whose orientation
                                    in matters of continental policy was looked upon with disfavor
                                    by certain elements closely allied to the Argentine and which

                        <p>147. From Braden. Your 74, August 20, 3 p.m. The Brazilian Delegate
                            doubts that his Government has recognized because day before yesterday
                            he received cable approval of procedure referred to in last paragraph of
                            my 144, August 19, 6 p.m. Uruguayan Delegate states his Government has
                            instructed representative in Asuncion to recognize but first to consult
                            with other mediatory representatives. Despite the foregoing all
                            delegates agreed meeting this afternoon to recommend to our respective
                            governments that no action be taken on recognition at least until the
                            Conference has an opportunity to consider the Paraguayan answer to the
                            suggestion of the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs, reported in my
                            telegram 143, August 19 [<hi rend="italic">18</hi>], 7 p.m. which
                            suggestion was delivered to the Paraguayan Minister today. The Argentine
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs has requested Cardinal Copello, now in
                            Asuncion, to urge Paraguayan <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0746"
                            />acceptance of his suggestion and to the same end Argentine Minister in
                            Paraguay is returning there by plane Monday.</p>
                        <p>9:00 o’clock. Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that the
                            Paraguayan Minister telephoned that he has been instructed to deliver
                            note accepting suggestion made by the Argentine Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs. Before commenting I prefer to see the note itself.

                        <p>14. Tour 28, August 19, midnight. Braden reports under date of August 20
                            that the Brazilian delegate doubts that his Government has extended
                            recognition because the Brazilian delegate received cable approval on
                            August 18 for procedure of approximately simultaneous and similar notes
                            of recognition from the mediatory governments. The Uruguayan delegate
                            informed Braden that his Government had instructed the representative in
                            Asunción to recognize but first to consult with other mediatory
                            representatives. The mediatory delegates in Buenos Aires agreed on
                            August 20 to recommend to their respective governments that no action be
                            taken on recognition at least until the conference has an opportunity to
                            consider the Paraguayan reply to the suggestion of the Argentine
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs that the new Paraguayan Government declare
                            to the conference its purpose to comply with the pacts and agreements
                            signed in Buenos Aires on the Chaco question and its intention to pursue
                            the negotiations with the conference in a determined way to find a just
                            solution of the fundamental question in accordance with the protocols in
                            force. The Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Braden
                            that the Paraguayan Minister telephoned that he had been instructed to
                            deliver the note accepting the suggestion made by the Argentine Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs. Braden has informed the Department that he is
                            reserving comment until he has seen the note itself.</p>
                        <p>This telegram is being repeated to Braden with instructions to
                            communicate with you by telephone regarding the question of recognition.
                            The Department will send further instructions as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>From Braden. Your 76, August 21, 1 p.m. telephoned to Howard, very bad
                            connection. Insofar as I could hear conversation may be summarized as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Brazilian Minister states he has recognized. Uruguayan is about
                                    to do so. He has not consulted with Howard. The American
                                    Minister has heard nothing of the Argentine Minister for Foreign
                                    Affairs’ suggestion. He concurs in fears expressed in my
                                    telegrams 138, August 17, 9 a.m., and 139, August 17, 8 [<hi
                                        rend="italic">5</hi>] p.m.; he agrees recognition may be
                                    deferred until Tuesday or Wednesday but naturally, from his
                                    viewpoint, wishes to recognize as soon as possible. He says
                                    undue delay might upset present Government though he does not
                                    think it likely. There has been no concerted action by the
                                    mediatory representatives in Asuncion.[”]</p>

                        <p>77. For Braden. Inasmuch as the information regarding recognition given
                            you over the telephone by Howard appears at variance with that contained
                            in your 147, August 20, 8 p.m., you are requested to cable fully at once
                            the situation as you understand it. If the note mentioned in the last
                            paragraph of your 147, August 20, 8 p.m., has been received from the
                            Paraguayan Minister please telegraph pertinent section.</p>
                        <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0748"/>
                        <p>This Government is willing to accord recognition simultaneously with the
                            other mediatory countries. However, if those countries are not
                            cooperating it is essential that the Department be kept fully and
                            currently informed regarding their recognition moves.</p>

                        <p>152. From Braden. Department’s 77, August 23, 1 p.m. The Brazilian
                            delegate has shown me telegrams exchanged with his Foreign Office from
                            which it appears that the matter was mishandled in Rio. The fact remains
                            Brazil has recognized, which of course may weaken Conference efforts to
                            obtain adequate assurances from the new government. The Uruguayan
                            delegate informs me his Foreign Office does not believe their
                            representative has recognized yet; instructions have again been given
                            him to consult other mediatory representatives. The Uruguayan delegate
                            does not think his country’s recognition will be given until remaining
                            mediatory powers do so but in my opinion Uruguayan cooperation should
                            not be counted on.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="20" xml:id="d721fn20"
                                >Carlos Saavedra Lamas.</note> misinformed me on Friday night for
                            the note received from the Paraguayan Minister was not a reply to the
                            suggestion cabled in my telegram 143, August 18, 7 p.m., but was a note
                            addressed not to the Conference but to the Foreign Office declaring
                            Paraguay’s intention to respect international agreements. It appears
                            likely that Paraguayan Minister because of pique with new government did
                            not transmit Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs’ suggestion. The
                            President of Paraguay told Cardinal Copello yesterday that he desired
                            the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs to indicate a satisfactory
                            procedure based on Paiva’s published declaration. Therefore S. Lamas
                            suggestion will be submitted to Paiva by the Cardinal or by the
                            Argentine Minister at Asuncion and we should have a definite answer
                            within the next 24 to 48 hours. The delegates agreed today that
                            meanwhile we should await this answer. Paiva’s statement published
                            yesterday was as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“With regard to foreign policy the provisional Government will
                                    comply strictly with the pacts and covenants in accordance with
                                    the provisions of the Constitution. The state will put all its
                                    good will <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0749"/>at the
                                    service of the high ideals of concord and peaceful international
                                    coexistence which has always inspired the governments of
                                    Paraguay and will pay particular attention to the negotiations
                                    with the peace conference in Buenos Aires with which it will
                                    cooperate efficaciously so that its action will develop in an
                                    atmosphere of cordial understanding in order that from it may
                                    come peace hoped for by the continent and particularly the two
                                    countries which were in armed conflict.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In my opinion the situation is as follows:</p>
                        <p>Acceptance by Paraguay of the S. Lamas suggestion would put the
                            Conference in a better position to demand active territorial
                            negotiations and compliance with the January 10 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >9</hi>] bases and regulations. On the other hand even if the
                            suggestion is accepted and a statement made in line with my 143, August
                            18, 7 p.m., Paraguay can find a way to delay negotiations. If the
                            statement is not made we can definitely expect stalling for several
                            months or until a constitutional assembly is elected there.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the above even if the desired statement from Paraguay is
                            not forthcoming within 48 hours further withholding of recognition might
                            be interpreted by the Paraguayan Government as undue pressure and it
                            would probably be best to resign ourselves to further delays and proceed
                            to recognize.</p>

                            reports announcement by Paraguayan Foreign Office that Brazil, Argentina
                            and Uruguay had recognized the new government. Your 154, August 25, 11
                            a.m., indicates that the report as concerns Argentina is not correct.

                        <p>156. From Braden. My 152 [<hi rend="italic">154</hi>], August 25, 11 a.m.
                            Paraguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs’ telegram to Conference
                            President, while not as specific as desired, was considered as
                            warranting mediatory powers proceeding to recognize. Argentina and Chile
                            intend to do so tomorrow; Peru tomorrow or next day. I recommend that
                            the United States recognize tomorrow if possible. I would appreciate
                            being advised when recognition is extended.</p>

                            officially recognized the new government, Cuba, Brazil and Uruguay.
                            Chilean and Argentine Ministers have just received authority to
                            recognize but are waiting until this afternoon in order to do so
                            simultaneously with the United States if possible. Peru expecting

                            Apparently strict censorship. Last word which came through to the press
                            here at 3:00 o’clock was that new Government has been established headed
                            by triumvirate consisting of Colonels Franco, Juan Ayala and Smith and
                            that there was fighting in the streets.</p>

                            afternoon, Franco stated he had been called back to Asuncion and was
                            leaving by plane tomorrow morning. He expects to resume the presidency
                            with increased authority. He says Stefanich is not returning with him
                            and new Cabinet will be appointed. He promised full cooperation to speed
                            negotiations and that one of his first official acts will be to declare

                        <p>36. Heavy fighting in city and suburbs yesterday afternoon and during
                            night with all communications cut. Revolutionists held control <pb

                            been the work of Major Martin Cich with few regular troops plus a small
                            section of the navy and the major portion of the police force together
                            with a considerable number of ex-combatants and laborers, most of the

                        <p>The police regulations regarding meetings remains in force as does the
                            rule that no one is to be on the streets after ten p.m. There are many
                            patrols out all night and they start warning pedestrians and persons in
                            wheeled traffic as early as nine-thirty that it is time to get off the
                            streets. There have been a number of instances where police have
                            searched persons for arms before ten o’clock, several instances of
                            search as early as seven o’clock having been reported.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable rifle firing at night on the 12th, 13th, and 14th.
                            However, since that time there have only been random shots. Two or three
                            deaths from bullet wounds have been reported.</p>
                        <p>The city was full of government military trucks and foot patrols during
                            the night of the 12–13. It is obvious that Colonel Luis Irrazabal was
                            contemplating some move, the details of which are not as yet available
                            (See despatch No. 455 of September 17, 1937).<note n="24"

                            documents and have left for the Argentine or Uruguay. It is reported
                            that a number of persons implicated in the last uprising attempted to
                            enter the Argentine at Clorinda and other nearby points but that they

                        <p>In a discussion of the proposed trade agreement today the Foreign
                                Minister<note n="6" xml:id="d738fn6">Esteban Gil Borges.</note>
                            stated that in view of the removal by his Government of the <pb n="747"
                                xml:id="pg_747" facs="0757"/>discriminations against American
                            commerce he hoped it would now be possible to proceed rapidly to the
                            conclusion of such an agreement. He said that he had examined the text
                            of various trade agreements entered into by the United States with
                            foreign countries and was of the opinion that the general principles set
                            forth therein formed a satisfactory basis for an agreement with
                            Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>When I inquired as to the attitude of the Venezuelan Government with
                            respect to the unconditional most-favored-nation clause the Minister
                            replied that he would have no objection to the inclusion of such a
                            clause in the case of a treaty with the United States. He urged that the
                            provisions of the proposed agreement be made as brief and simple as
                            possible and asked whether one of the existing trade agreements would be
                            taken as a model or whether a special text would be drawn up for
                            Venezuela. I shall await the Department’s further instructions before
                            proceeding with discussions.</p>

                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs orally that in view of the Venezuelan
                            Government’s action in removing the discrimination against American
                            commerce, <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0758"/>the Government of the
                            United States would now be pleased to discuss the provisions that might
                            be embodied in a reciprocal trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>I conveyed this message to the Minister on January 18, at the same time
                            stating, as instructed by the Department, that I expected to receive my
                            Government’s proposals, concessions and general provisions in the near
                            future by air mail. The Minister readily agreed to make no public
                            announcement on the subject for the time being, because, he said, he
                            felt sure that the French would be concerned at the proposed agreement
                            and would seek additional concessions for their trade as soon as it
                            became known.</p>
                        <p>At a reception in the Colombian Legation on the afternoon of the same
                            day, while I was conversing with President López Contreras and the
                            Foreign Minister, the latter reminded the President of the imminent
                            possibility that a trade agreement might be negotiated between Venezuela
                            and the United States. The President assured me that he was greatly
                            interested in the proposal and that he believed trade between the two
                            countries could be materially benefited and stimulated by such an
                            agreement. The Minister of Hacienda later mentioned to me that his
                            Department was prepared to discuss possible concessions whenever
                            convenient to the Legation.</p>

                        <p>9. The Foreign Minister told me today he had been informed that a bill
                            raising the excise tax on imported petroleum to one cent a gallon had
                            been introduced in the United States Congress and probably would be
                            reported favorably February 8. He said that he regarded this development
                            as unfortunate on eve of negotiations for reciprocal trade agreement and
                            that he was telegraphing the Venezuelan Minister in Washington to
                            discuss matter with you as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>While Venezuela is not seriously concerned at prospect of higher excise
                            taxes in the United States for reasons mentioned in my telegram No. 84,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to the Department’s
                            telegram No. 5 of January 16, 1937 and to your despatch No. 598 of
                            January 22 in regard to the initiation of conversations with the
                            Venezuelan Government on the subject of a reciprocal trade
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Department encloses a set of general provisions with the request that
                            you discuss these informally with the appropriate officials of the
                            Venezuelan Government as a basis for a trade agreement. You should,
                            however, make it clear that these proposed general provisions are of a
                            tentative nature and that this Government may desire to modify them at a
                            later stage of conversations. There is now being prepared a new draft of
                            an article on foreign exchange transactions for use in future trade
                            agreements. When this article has been completed, the Department will
                            send it to you as Article X of the proposed general provisions.</p>
                        <p>The remainder of this instruction is for your strictly confidential
                            information.</p>
                        <p>Article XI of the general provisions provides for complete and
                            unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. No exception has been made
                            to the provisions of that Article whereby the 30 percent surtax could be
                            levied by Venezuela on articles imported from Puerto Rico and the Virgin
                            Islands. The Department is giving careful study to the subject of the 30
                            percent surtax and will instruct you further with regard thereto at a
                            later date.</p>
                        <p>The desirability of binding Venezuelan national internal taxes on certain
                            or all of the products which may be contained in Schedule I is likewise
                            receiving consideration in the Department. In the event it is decided
                            that such taxes, on one or more products contained in Schedule I, should
                            be bound to the United States, it will be necessary to specifically
                            provide for such binding in the trade agreement, as Article V of the
                            general provisions, which is the only article pertaining to taxes, fees,
                            charges or exactions imposed on imports <hi rend="italic">after</hi>
                            their importation, provides only for national and most-favored-nation
                            treatment. You are requested to transmit to the Department your views
                            and recommendations with respect to the desirability of requesting a
                            binding of Venezuelan national internal taxes on cigarettes and on any
                            other commodity whether or not included in the tentative Schedule I
                            contained in the preliminary report of the country committee on
                            Venezuela enclosed with the Department’s instruction No. 150 of February
                            10, 1937.<note n="8" xml:id="d742fn8">This instruction merely

                            general provisions which would insure equitable treatment to either
                            party to the Agreement with respect to Government purchases of foreign
                            products other than purchases made by a Government monopoly or licensed
                            agency.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 153 of February 16, 1937 enclosing a set of
                            general provisions to be discussed with the appropriate officials of the
                            Venezuelan Government as a basis for a trade agreement. As reported in
                            my telegram No. 16 of February 23, 6 p.m.<note n="9" xml:id="d743fn9"
                                >Not printed.</note> conversations on the subject were initiated in
                            the Foreign Office on that day, at which time I made it clear that the
                            proposed general provisions were of a tentative nature and that my
                            Government might desire to modify them at a later stage of the
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>My telegram No. 18 of February 25, 3 p.m.<note n="9" xml:id="d743fn10"
                                >Not printed.</note> reported that the Foreign Minister had told me
                            that the general provisions would be taken up at a cabinet meeting on
                            March 5 and that he had expressed a strong hope that negotiations on
                            Schedules I and II might commence at an early date. Dr. Gil Borges
                            stated that he was anxious to proceed as rapidly as possible with the
                            discussions and that he was circularizing members of the new cabinet
                            with copies of the general provisions in order that they might be in a
                            position to express their views on the subject at the meeting on March
                            5. He also proposed to have a study made of the provisions by the
                            Counselor of the Foreign Office, Dr. Juan José Mendoza, and to go over
                            the matter within the next few days with the new Minister of Hacienda,
                            Dr. Cristóbal Mendoza. The two Dr. Mendozas are brothers, and both are
                            personal friends of Dr. Gil Borges.</p>
                        <p>I told the Foreign Minister that so far no public announcement had been
                            made in the United States of the proposed agreement and that I did not
                            know whether tentative schedules were available for transmission <pb
                                n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0768"/>to his Government as yet.
                            Nevertheless, he said he hoped that some indication of the schedules
                            could soon be drawn up, in order that conversations on them and on the
                            general provisions might proceed simultaneously. I may observe
                            confidentially in this connection that if the schedules can be
                            introduced before the new Minister of Hacienda is influenced by certain
                            extreme nationalist elements in his department, the prospects for
                            success will be greatly enhanced.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Department’s request for an expression of my views as
                            to the desirability of requesting a binding of Venezuelan national
                            internal taxes on cigarettes, I believe that such a request might well
                            be included in the trade agreement negotiations. When the present high
                            internal revenue tax on cigarettes was adopted by the Venezuelan
                            Government, the Legation was given to understand that the customs import
                            duties on American cigarettes might later be reduced “for justifiable
                            reasons,” thus bringing the total cost of such products down to the
                            previous level. While the Venezuelan Government would no doubt consider
                            cigarettes to be one of the products on which duty reductions might be
                            granted in the event of a trade agreement with the United States, there
                            is nothing to prevent a subsequent further increase in the internal
                            revenue tax which would render negative the advantages derived in a
                            trade agreement. As the financial policies of the Ministry of Hacienda
                            are subject to change without notice, a binding of the present internal
                            tax would appear desirable if such can be obtained without undue
                            administrative difficulty in Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>I also believe it would be desirable to add to Article IX a clause as
                            suggested by the Department which would insure equitable treatment to
                            either party with respect to Government purchases of foreign products
                            other than purchases made by a Government monopoly or licensed agency.
                            Most of the official purchases made by Venezuela are undertaken directly
                            by the Government rather than by a Government monopoly or agency. I do
                            not think there would be any difficulty in obtaining agreement to the
                            insertion or addition of such a clause.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the question of petroleum, representatives of the
                            Standard Oil of New Jersey have approached me for the second time with
                            an inquiry as to the prospects for a trade agreement with Venezuela,
                            Major Thomas Armstrong of the New York office called today with Mr.
                            Robert Wells, recently assigned to work in Venezuela, and stated that
                            his company was naturally perturbed at the proposal in the United States
                            Congress to double the excise taxes on petroleum or petroleum products.
                            He said that the independent oil companies appeared to have strong
                            support in their backing of this measure, while for political reasons it
                            would be “hopeless” for the Standard Oil or other large interests to
                            plead against it.</p>
                        <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0769"/>
                        <p>Major Armstrong added that he proposed to point out to the Foreign
                            Minister the danger to Venezuela in any proposal of this kind, and to
                            urge that the matter of petroleum be given foremost consideration in
                            case negotiations took place for a trade agreement. He said that he was
                            going to inform the Foreign Minister that in case the excise taxes were
                            raised in the United States his company would have to curtail production
                            and cease shipping its products as formerly to American ports.</p>

                        <p>23. Department’s telegram No. 12, March 4, 6 p.m. Foreign Minister states
                            that owing to absence of President and other officials <pb n="760"
                                xml:id="pg_760" facs="0770"/>during Easter holidays it will not be
                            possible to reach an <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> agreement
                            prior to April 15. While he considers that negotiations have in fact
                            begun, he is unwilling to give assurances that substantial agreement has
                            been reached with reference to the general provisions until he has
                            further consulted the Ministers of Fomento, Hacienda, Agriculture, and
                            the Caracas Chamber of Commerce.</p>
                        <p>The Minister added that while the Venezuelan Government would have some
                            proposals to make on the wording of the general provisions he did not
                            anticipate that the suggested changes would handicap the negotiations.
                            He felt, however, that the unconditional most-favored-nation clause and
                            the proposed article on foreign exchange would require special
                            consideration. If the Venezuelan authorities undertake a detailed study
                            of these subjects, the results thereof in the Legation’s opinion may not
                            be known for some time.</p>
                        <p>It seems possible that the Foreign Minister does not fully understand the
                            implications of an <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> agreement. Can
                            the Department furnish an explicit statement of its interpretation of
                            this phrase?</p>

                        <p>16. Your telegram No. 23, March 23, 5:00 p.m. Inform the Foreign Minister
                            that until this Government is prepared to issue public announcement of
                            intention to negotiate, all conversations concerning the general
                            provisions are considered strictly confidential and that, therefore, it
                            would be appreciated if special precautions are taken by the Venezuelan
                            authorities to insure that any discussions of the general provisions
                            with the Caracas Chamber of Commerce or with any other agency outside
                            the Venezuelan Government will not be given any publicity.</p>
                        <p>You may inform the Foreign Minister, if the need arises, that by “<hi
                                rend="italic">ad referendum</hi>” the Department meant merely that
                            any agreement reached by the Legation and the Venezuelan authorities
                            with regard to the general provisions is subject to approval by the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>In view of your conversation with the Foreign Minister reported in your
                            telegram No. 4 of January 12, 1937, the Department would appreciate any
                            information which the Legation may have as to the reason for the
                            hesitation on the part of the Venezuelan authorities in regard to the
                            unconditional most-favored-nation principle.</p>

                        <p>26. Department’s 16, March 26, 6 p.m. Foreign Minister has agreed to
                            postpone consultations with Chamber of Commerce until the Department has
                            issued public announcement of intention to negotiate trade agreement. He
                            states that he regards all conversations concerning the general
                            provisions as strictly confidential.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the hesitation on the part of the Venezuelan authorities
                            in regard to the unconditional most-favored-nation principle it is the
                            Legation’s impression that this is due to an unwillingness to enter into
                            any such commitment with nations imposing quotas or other restrictions
                            on Venezuelan goods. In this connection, it is believed that the
                            authorities have particularly in mind such countries as Italy, France,
                            and Germany which feel free to demand favors from Venezuela but which at
                            the same time make difficulties in the importation of Venezuelan
                            products.</p>
                        <p>While this has apparently created an antagonistic attitude toward
                            most-favored-nation treaties, the Foreign Minister upon specific
                            questioning has now affirmed that in the case of the United States there
                            would be no objection to embodying the unconditional clause in a trade
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Venezuelan authorities are making progress in their study of the general
                            provisions but are handicapped by the lack of technical staff. The
                            Foreign Minister feels that the language is complicated and difficult to
                            understand and that the terms cannot be considered as a whole until the
                            article on exchange control is received.</p>

                        <p>27. My No. 26, March 29, 8 p.m. Foreign Office has raised objection to
                            Articles 7, 8 and 9 of proposed trade agreement on the ground that
                            language is too technical and difficult to reconcile with the
                            experience, <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0772"/>practice, or policy
                            of Venezuela. After consultation with other interested departments it
                            will submit an alternate draft of these three articles embodying the
                            same principles but briefer and less technically worded.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister states that he would be glad to have the Department
                            now make public announcement of its intention to negotiate but that he
                            is unable to conclude an <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> agreement
                            on the general provisions or to assert that substantial agreement has
                            been reached on the principles thereof until negotiations have actually
                            taken place. While he believes personally that the provisions are in
                            general acceptable, he maintains that in stating so officially he would
                            be committing himself to formulas and principles which it might be
                            desirable to modify during the course of negotiations, besides binding
                            his Government to an agreement which must be submitted to Congress for
                            ratification. He hopes that public announcement may be made
                            simultaneously in Washington and Caracas at an early date after which he
                            feels that he may appropriately consult the President and that rapid
                            progress can be made in the conversations.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister in a note dated April 6 and again orally today
                            expressed the hope that the exchange control article as well as the
                            tentative schedules will soon be available. He states that until the
                            former is received he cannot proceed with his discussions of the
                            agreement with other Cabinet Ministers.</p>

                        <p>17. Your No. 27, April 8, 1937. The Department does not take the position
                            that agreement must be reached with respect to the text of the draft
                            general provisions now under consideration by the Venezuelan Government;
                            it is sufficient, prior to the announcement that a trade agreement with
                            Venezuela is contemplated, that the Venezuelan Government agree to the
                            broad principles underlying such provisions. You are requested to make
                            this clear to the Venezuelan Foreign Minister and to inform him that the
                            Department desires the Venezuelan Government’s agreement to such
                            principles as the basis upon which negotiations will take place,
                            subject, of course, to such ratification by the Venezuelan Congress as
                            may be necessary.</p>
                        <p>From your telegram No. 26 of March 29, it appears that the Venezuelan
                            Government will agree to the unconditional most-favored-nation principle
                            as regards the United States; the first paragraph of <pb n="763"
                                xml:id="pg_763" facs="0773"/>your telegram No. 27, would seem to
                            indicate that while there is not agreement on the part of the Venezuelan
                            Government as to the language of Articles 7, 8 and 9, there is agreement
                            as to the principles embodied in those Articles. You are requested to
                            inform the Foreign Minister that when the Venezuelan Government has
                            confirmed its agreement with respect to the indicated principles, and
                            signifies its agreement to the other principles embodied in the general
                            provisions, such as that underlying the Article on exchange control,
                            which is being sent to you, the Department will be disposed to arrange a
                            date shortly thereafter for the issuance here, and also in Caracas if
                            the Venezuelan Government desires, of a public announcement that a trade
                            agreement is contemplated. You should inform the Foreign Minister that,
                            in accordance with established procedure, this announcement will include
                            the statement that at a later date a second public announcement will be
                            made here of the articles under consideration as subjects for
                            concessions to be granted to Venezuela. This second announcement will
                            constitute a formal invitation to our domestic interests to submit
                            briefs with respect to the listed articles and will set a date for
                            public hearings before the Committee for Reciprocity Information as
                            required by the Trade Agreements Act. You should ascertain whether the
                            Venezuelan Government has any objection to this procedure. In this
                            connection you may point out to the Foreign Minister, if you deem it
                            advisable, that the foregoing involve only our own procedure here and
                            that it does not involve our making public announcement, prior to
                            conclusion of the agreement, of the products on which we shall seek
                            concessions from Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the Department by telegram of the result of any
                            conversations with the Foreign Minister in regard to the matters set
                            forth herein.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to the Department’s
                            instruction of February 16, 1937, in regard to the general provisions
                            which it is proposed to include in a trade agreement with Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>The provision on exchange control has now been completed and the text of
                            this provision is enclosed herewith as Article X of the general
                            provisions.</p>
                        <p>The intention of this article is to ensure the availability of exchange
                            for all future imports of American products at the most favorable <pb
                                n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0774"/>rate which is in effect with
                            respect to any current commercial transactions. It does not, however,
                            mean that exchange control must be abolished, but merely that exchange
                            must be made available to pay for all permitted imports of American
                            products. If there is a shortage of exchange for this purpose, Venezuela
                            may limit importation of American products, provided that such
                            limitations do not violate the other provisions of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The theory underlying the new provision on exchange control is that,
                            unless we are assured that exchange will become available at the most
                            favorable rate for all imports of American goods, there can be no
                            assurance that the concessions which may be granted by Venezuela with
                            respect to tariff duties, quantitative restrictions, et cetera, will not
                            be rendered ineffective through exchange control. Hence, if Venezuelan
                            officials should claim that they cannot accept this article, you should
                            ask them what form of assurance they would be prepared to give to the
                            effect that the other provisions in an agreement would not be rendered
                            ineffective through exchange control.</p>
                        <p>The result of the inclusion of the new provision on exchange control in a
                            trade agreement would be that if Venezuela should find it necessary, in
                            order to protect the value of its currency, to restrict payments for
                            imports from the United States, such restrictions would have to be
                            effected through the restriction of importations, and such restrictions
                            would have to conform to the provisions contained in Articles VII and
                            VIII. If, however, Venezuela should suffer from a serious shortage of
                            exchange, the Venezuelan Government might find that the provisions of
                            Article VII, as transmitted to you on February 16, do not allow
                            sufficient freedom of action to impose the necessary restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Hence it has been decided to modify Article VII in order to provide
                            greater flexibility. The text of that article is accordingly amended in
                            the manner indicated below.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the first sentence of the second paragraph, delete the
                            period following the word “articles” and insert a comma, followed by:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“or imposed in order to maintain the exchange
                                    value of the currency of the country.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This amendment to Article VII would permit Venezuela to impose
                            quantitative restrictions on articles named in Schedule I if this were
                            necessary to protect the value of its currency. It would, however, be
                            necessary for Venezuela to give notice of such restrictions thirty days
                            in advance of their imposition and to satisfy this Government of their
                            necessity for the purpose envisaged. It must of <pb n="765"
                                xml:id="pg_765" facs="0775"/>course be understood that the
                            provisions of Article VIII would apply to such restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Your attention is drawn to a typographical error in the general
                            provisions as sent to you on February 16. In Article VII, second
                            paragraph, eleventh line, the word “subparagraph” should read
                            “paragraph.”</p>

                        <p>31. Department’s 17, April 14, 6 p.m. The Foreign Minister fully realizes
                            that no agreement is sought with respect to the text of the draft
                            general provisions prior to the announcement of intention to negotiate
                            and that the Venezuelan Government is being asked at the time only to
                            agree to the broad principles underlying such provisions. However, for
                            the reasons set forth in the second paragraph of my telegram No. 27,
                            April 8, 6 p.m. the Minister is unwilling to commit his Government
                            officially to an agreement upon these principles until further
                            conversations have revealed whether modifications or changes in such
                            principles might not be desirable.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the contents of the Department’s telegram under reference
                            this morning the Minister repeated his previous declarations on the
                            subject and stated that if the Department desired the Venezuelan
                            Government’s agreement to the underlying principles prior to the
                            initiation of formal negotiations, it would appear necessary for him
                            first to consult other interested Government agencies and obtain their
                            approval of such principles. He explained that he would have to proceed
                            slowly and carefully in this matter until he could present to the
                            Cabinet a formal request for authorization to proceed with negotiations
                            on the basis of the principles in question. As soon as Cabinet approval
                            was forthcoming he would feel free to signify his Government’s agreement
                            to the principles underlying the draft provisions.</p>
                        <p>The Minister again mentioned what he termed the prolixity of the general
                            provisions and the difficulty of obtaining a proper understanding
                            thereof in the Spanish language. He added that in view of the delicacy
                            of the exchange question in Venezuela as in the rest of the world the
                            expected article on exchange control would probably require special

                        <p>20. Your No. 31, April 15, 1937. Please call on the Foreign Minister at
                            his earliest convenience and inform him that this Government <pb n="767"
                                xml:id="pg_767" facs="0777"/>would like to proceed as rapidly as
                            possible with the negotiation of a trade agreement, and is prepared to
                            issue the preliminary public announcement just as soon as he, speaking
                            for his Government, can give the assurance requested with regard to the
                            basis upon which negotiations will take place. You may say to the
                            Minister that this Government is sure he will appreciate that it would
                            serve no useful purpose to proceed with the negotiations unless the two
                            Governments are in agreement in advance that the proposed general
                            provisions will be based upon the unconditional most-favored-nation
                            principle as applied to customs duties, exchange matters, quotas, et
                            cetera. You may assure him that if his Government is disposed to agree
                            to this principle as the primary basis of the general provisions, the
                            precise language of the general provisions that will embody this
                            principle can be discussed during the formal negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Department will instruct you fully by air mail as to the procedural
                            steps to be taken if and when agreement is reached on the basis for
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>34. Department’s telegram No. 20, April 21, 5 p.m. In an interview
                            yesterday the Foreign Minister stated that a preliminary study of the
                            exchange control article caused him to fear that provisions as now
                            worded would prejudice the entire agreement. He said that while this
                            opinion remained to be confirmed by other interested government
                            departments, he felt sure that Venezuela could give no assurance that
                            exchange would be made available for all imports of American goods
                            because the country is dependent for its supply of foreign exchange upon
                            the daily sales of drafts by the oil companies. In view of the
                            unpredictable fluctuations in the available amount thereof he said the
                            Venezuelan Government was averse to entering into any undertaking with
                            respect to exchange transactions and in the event of an exchange control
                            probably would be disinclined to impose any such measure as a
                            quantitative limitation on the importation of American goods for the
                            purpose of protecting the value of its currency.</p>
                        <p>When asked what form of assurance he might consider giving to the effect
                            that the other provisions of the proposed agreement would not be
                            rendered ineffective through the operation of an exchange control, the
                            Minister said that the matter was predicated upon a condition which did
                            not exist and which was contrary to <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768"
                                facs="0778"/>Venezuela’s experience, or, he said, that Venezuela was
                            one of the few countries in the world which did not impose quotas,
                            license systems, or other trade barriers and that since the proposed
                            general provisions seemed to deal chiefly with these subjects he felt
                            the negotiations were being needlessly compulsory.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then volunteered to submit a tentative alternate draft of a
                            trade agreement embodying the views of the Venezuelan Government in
                            short and concise form. Although it was made clear to him that the
                            reciprocal trade agreements negotiated by the United States are
                            generally standardized as to form, the Minister said that he thought it
                            would be unwise to proceed with negotiations until he had had an
                            opportunity to draw up such a draft and to conduct an exchange of views
                            thereon.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my representations on the contents of the Department’s
                            telegram No. 20 accompanied by an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                            for greater clarity, the Foreign Minister said that the
                            most-favored-nation principle was already being extended to the United
                            States in accordance with the Legation’s request last December, the
                            results of which were reported in despatch 579 of January 12, 1937.<note
                                n="12" xml:id="d753fn12">Not printed.</note> While expressing his
                            approval of the principle, he was obviously unwilling to enter into any
                            official commitment that it would constitute the basis for negotiations
                            until he had drawn up the alternate draft referred to.</p>
                        <p>While the Venezuelan Government has previously stressed its desire to
                            negotiate a trade agreement I believe that its examination of the
                            proposed general provisions has at this particular time a fundamental
                            difference in the viewpoints of the two governments as to the form such
                            an agreement shall take. Owing partly to its lack of technical
                            experience and to its policy of confining the provisions of commercial
                            agreements to the simplest terms, I doubt whether the Venezuelan
                            authorities can be prevailed upon to accept any provisions such as those
                            embodied in the exchange control article.</p>

                        <p>64. Your No. 33, May 20, 7 p.m.<note n="13" xml:id="d755fn13">This
                                telegram requested information as to comments of the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs regarding the general provisions
                                (611.3131/101).</note> In a protracted discussion yesterday the
                            Foreign Minister raised so many objections to the substance of the
                            reciprocal trade agreement as presented by the Department that I now
                            doubt seriously whether such an agreement can be negotiated with
                            Venezuela. I do not believe that he has any clear idea as yet as to the
                            form he would like the agreement to take and he admitted that he had not
                            made much progress in working out an alternate draft or list of comments
                            in regard to the proposed general provisions.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that there were two main problems which
                            concerned Venezuela, namely, petroleum and the question of foreign
                            exchange. He pointed out that the recent substantial appreciation in the
                            exchange rate of the bolivar relative to the dollar had made it much
                            easier for American exporters to sell goods to Venezuela and I gathered
                            that he was therefore disinclined to contemplate material reductions in
                            import duties at this time. He said that he was still carrying on
                            conversations with the Minister of Hacienda on the subject but it is my
                            impression that as long as Venezuela’s financial policy remains in its
                            present undefined state it will be impossible to include any reference
                            to foreign exchange in a trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Minister also referred to the 30% surtax on importations from the
                            Colonial Antilles which he said could not be abolished and which raised
                            the problem of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. He furthermore
                            qualified his recent assurances with regard to the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation clause by stating that the United States had been
                            formally granted the preferential treatment following the Legation’s
                            representations last December and that it would be unnecessary to embody
                            any reference thereto in a trade agreement. His additional statement
                            that Venezuela could not afford to have other countries claim similar
                            treatment under existing covenants leads me to believe that he has so
                            far reversed his position as to be unwilling <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770"
                                facs="0780"/>to mention unconditional most-favored-nation treatment
                            in any agreement with the United States.</p>
                        <p>With respect to tariff reductions, the Minister stated that he could
                            perceive no material favors which the United States could grant to the
                            commerce of Venezuela and he displayed considerable coolness to the idea
                            of schedules annexed to a trade agreement granting specific reductions
                            on a long list of commodities unilaterally presented by the United
                            States. When asked frankly whether his friends would be interested in
                            some concession on petroleum he replied in the negative stating that
                            Venezuelan exports of petroleum went principally to the Netherlands West
                            Indies and that what happened to them subsequently concerned the
                            producing companies and not the Venezuelan Government. All these
                            differences he said were difficult to reconcile [apparent omission] form
                            to be embodied in a trade agreement especially as he wished such an
                            agreement to conform to a general revision of Venezuela’s commercial
                            treaties which is now under contemplation.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested to the Foreign Minister that if the reciprocal agreement
                            proposed by the Department was unacceptable to his Government it might
                            now be advisable to make a candid statement to that effect but he
                            declined to do so until he had studied the possibilities of an alternate
                            draft. From our conversations on the subject I am inclined to think that
                            his views as to the latter envisage merely a brief instrument of two or
                            three articles in the form of a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> or
                            exchange of notes “regulating the commercial relations between the two
                            countries” possibly on the lines of the agreement concluded with France
                            last August. He still promises to submit an alternate draft at the
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>It is discouraging to realize from the foregoing that ever since the
                            draft general provisions were presented the eagerness of the Venezuelan
                            Government to conclude a trade agreement with the United States has
                            steadily diminished. Although the Foreign Minister has been fully aware
                            of the scope and form of the reciprocal agreements previously negotiated
                            by the United States, actual examination of the proposed provisions
                            particularly the article on foreign exchange coupled with recent
                            developments in relation to the oil companies and the exchange rate of
                            the bolivar has apparently brought about a complete change in attitude.
                            Difficulties of the situation are enhanced by the lack of familiarity
                            with the subject on the part of new Cabinet ministers and by the fact
                            that the conduct of negotiations rests solely with the overburdened
                            Foreign Minister. The latter appreciated the position of the Legation in
                            this matter and is instructing the Venezuelan Minister in Washington to
                            explain the situation to the Department. <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771"
                                facs="0781"/>I would suggest that the Department go into the subject
                            fully with Doctor Escalante.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to your telegram No. 64 of
                            May 21 last, reporting a discussion on the day previous between you and
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs in regard to a possible reciprocal trade
                            agreement, you are requested, unless you perceive objection, to present
                            to the Minister a memorandum incorporating the substance of the enclosed
                            draft.</p>
                        <p>You may also state orally to the Minister of Foreign Affairs that the
                            preliminary studies by this Government with respect to a possible trade
                            agreement between the United States and Venezuela indicate the
                            possibility, subject of course to developments following public
                            announcement and the presentation of views by private interests in this
                            country, of tariff and import tax reductions on the part of the United
                            States affecting, on the basis of 1935 figures, approximately 67 percent
                            of Venezuela’s total direct exports to the United States, in addition to
                            bindings of present tariff treatment on about 22 percent of Venezuela’s
                            direct exports to the United States. You may add that although the
                            possible concessions to Venezuela, on the basis of these tentative
                            studies would thus cover about 89 percent of Venezuela’s direct export
                            trade with the United States, these studies indicate on the other side
                            that the tentative requests to be made by the United States for tariff
                            reductions on the part of Venezuela would affect about 29 percent of
                            American exports to Venezuela, that requests for binding of present
                            tariff treatment would cover about 12 percent of United States exports,
                            and that together these requests would amount to only about 41 percent
                            or 42 percent of the total United States exports to Venezuela.</p>

                                possible negotiations for a trade agreement between the United
                                States and the United States of Venezuela. In the course of this
                                conversation His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                expressed the hesitation of his Government in accepting the
                                unconditional most-favored-nation principle as applied to foreign
                                exchange, and indicated doubt as to the value to his country of
                                concessions which the United States might be able to grant in
                                exchange for tariff concessions by the United States of
                                Venezuela.</p>
                            <p>In view of previous representations made by the Venezuelan Government
                                over a period of many months indicating that it was desirous of
                                negotiating with the United States a reciprocal trade agreement of
                                the kind which the United States had concluded in recent months with
                                a number of other countries, the Government of the United States has
                                been somewhat perplexed in being informed of what appears to be a
                                change in attitude of the Venezuelan Government in the matter. In
                                this connection the Government of the United States recalls that it
                                had been pleased to learn that on January 12, 1937, His Excellency
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the American Chargé
                                d’Affaires ad interim that he had examined the texts of various
                                trade agreements recently concluded by the United States and was of
                                the opinion that the general provisions thereof formed a
                                satisfactory basis for a trade agreement with Venezuela. It was with
                                satisfaction also that the Government of the United States had been
                                informed that His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs had in
                                previous discussions indicated the willingness of his Government to
                                subscribe to the unconditional most-favored-nation principle in a
                                trade agreement with the United States. With respect to foreign
                                exchange, assurances given in any trade agreement in regard to the
                                unconditional most-favored-nation principle as applied to import
                                tariffs would, of course, have little significance unless assurances
                                could also be obtained with respect to foreign exchange, for
                                obviously discrimination in the matter of exchange could render
                                meaningless assurances of most-favored-nation treatment in tariff
                                matters.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States assumes that if the Government of
                                Venezuela should desire to proceed with the negotiations for a trade
                                agreement, one of the primary objectives of both Governments would
                                necessarily be to give the fullest practicable application to the
                                most-favored-nation principle as applied to the treatment to be
                                accorded by each country to the commerce of the other. It is not
                                considered essential before initiating negotations to reach an
                                agreement on precise texts for the general provisions, as it is felt
                                that the provisions for carrying into effect the objective
                                aforementioned are <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0783"/>capable
                                of sufficient variation to permit a mutually satisfactory agreement
                                being attained without serious difficulty.</p>
                            <p>As the Venezuelan Government is aware, the United States, through its
                                trade agreement program, has been endeavoring to contribute its
                                share to the restoration of world commerce by reducing trade
                                restrictions and by furthering the principle of equality of trade
                                opportunity. Sixteen of these reciprocal trade agreements have
                                already been concluded in the last three years, and the Government
                                of the United States is now negotiating and exploring the
                                possibilities of concluding additional agreements. It is recalled
                                with deep appreciation and gratification that this program has had
                                the support of His Excellency, Doctor Gil Borges, who has on several
                                occasions expressed himself in favor of liberal trade policies. In
                                view of the cordial commercial relations existing between the United
                                States of America and the United States of Venezuela, and in view
                                also of the endorsement given by the Venezuelan Government to the
                                principle of equality of treatment of international trade at both

                                the Government of the United States has felt hopeful that the

                                this liberal trade program. This hope has been strengthened by the
                                representations made from time to time showing the desire of the
                                Venezuelan Government to negotiate with the United States a trade
                                agreement of the character mentioned.</p>

                                informed whether it is now the wish of the Venezuelan Government to

                                basis of equality of treatment of the kind which this Government has
                                negotiated with various countries in the recent past and is now
                                negotiating with other countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my telegram No. 68 of June
                            14, 7 p.m.,<note n="17" xml:id="d757fn17">Not printed.</note> I have the
                            honor to transmit the text, together with a translation thereof, <pb
                                n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0784"/>of the alternate draft<note
                                n="17a" xml:id="d757fn17a">Not printed.</note> of a reciprocal trade
                            agreement as proposed by the Venezuelan Minister for Foreign Affairs.
                            There is also transmitted herewith a copy and a translation of an
                            accompanying memorandum which the Minister handed me at the time of
                            presenting the draft trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>As the Department will observe the Foreign Minister’s draft is
                            considerably shorter than that proposed by the Department, consisting of
                            thirteen articles instead of the Department’s eighteen. In general,
                            however, it follows the lines of the Department’s draft and is more
                            comprehensive as to its provisions than I had been led to expect by the
                            recent remarks of the Foreign Minister which were reported in my
                            detailed telegram No. 64 of May 21, 6 p.m. In my opinion, while it does
                            not meet the Department’s position with respect to certain matters such
                            as exchange control and unconditional most favored nation treatment, it
                            affords sufficient basis for further discussions.</p>

                        <p>Pending the Department’s study of the alternate draft and its
                            instructions relative thereto, I shall not attempt formally to discuss
                            the subject with the Venezuelan authorities.</p>

                            <p>The general structure of the Agreement has not been changed with
                                respect to the text presented by the Legation of the United States
                                of America; it has only been adapted to the peculiar circumstances
                                of Venezuelan economy.</p>
                            <p>The essential points of view of the United States have been preserved
                                in the new text of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>In general, an effort has been made to substitute, without failing to
                                provide for, situations such as those involving quantitative
                                restrictions or controls over exports, etc., with a more simple and
                                general formula than that which is contained in the draft presented
                                by the Legation.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, one of the principal modifications consists in that
                                Articles VII, VIII and IX are condensed in the text of the Ministry
                                for Foreign Affairs into Article V.</p>
                            <p>Article X concerning exchange was suppressed, because in its general
                                sense it is included in the most favored nation clause, because it
                                    <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0785"/>provides for situations
                                which would hardly present themselves in Venezuela.</p>
                            <p>Article XI of the text presented by the Legation contains the most
                                favored nation clause. In the text of the Ministry for Foreign
                                Affairs it is contained in Article VI.</p>
                            <p>In the paragraphs of this article are set forth the exceptions
                                contained in Article XV of the American text; and moreover, (in No.
                                3 of paragraph 2), the exception regarding situations created by
                                Trade Agreements by virtue of which one of the Contracting Parties
                                obtains from the other State advantages through equivalent
                                concessions.</p>
                            <p>Article XI of the Venezuelan text provides that the Agreement shall
                                not apply to certain possessions and territories under American
                                control, among which are the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Thereby
                                the Ministry for Foreign Affairs desires to save that provision of
                                the Customs Tariff Law, Article 3, by virtue of which articles
                                proceeding from the Antilles and the Guianas are surcharged an
                                additional 30%. This provision is untouchable in the general opinion
                                of Venezuelans, because it constitutes a safeguard for the import
                                commerce of the country and the preservation of a great part of its
                                trade with Europe and the United States.</p>
                            <p>The other modifications are not of substance but of form and
                                arrangement.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 184 of June 11, 1937, transmitting a draft
                            memorandum to be presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the
                            subject of a possible reciprocal trade agreement, and to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 37 of June 16, 4 p.m.,<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d758fn18">Not printed.</note> instructing me to report by
                            telegraph as soon as the memorandum had been presented. For reasons
                            which appeared to me to be obvious, I despatched my telegram No. 69 of
                            June 17, 10 a.m.,<note n="18" xml:id="d758fn19">Not printed.</note>
                            stating that I believed it would be inexpedient to present the
                            memorandum until the Department had had an opportunity to consider the
                            contents of my telegram No. 68 of June 14, 7 p.m.,<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d758fn20">Not printed.</note> and my despatch No. 743 of
                            June 15 transmitting the Foreign Minister’s alternate draft of a trade
                            agreement and his accompanying comments.</p>
                        <p>The Legation has studied with interest the Department’s comments in the
                            body of instruction No. 184 of June 11 relative to the possibility <pb
                                n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0786"/>of tariff and import tax
                            reductions on the part of the United States affecting, on the basis of
                            1935 figures, approximately 67 percent of Venezuela’s total direct
                            imports to the United States. While the Legation has not yet received
                            from the Department any figures on this subject other than those
                            contained in the First Report of the Country Committee on Venezuela, and
                            while it cannot, therefore, make any categorical statements on the
                            matter, it may be observed that the 67 percent of Venezuela’s taxable
                            direct exports referred to would appear, on the basis of available
                            figures, to apply almost exclusively to shipments of crude petroleum. If
                            this is the case, such shipments may be narrowed down for practical
                            purposes to those made by the Mene Grande Oil Company (formerly the
                            Venezuelan Gulf Oil Company), since the two other producing companies in
                            Venezuela, the Royal Dutch Shell and the Standard of New Jersey, send
                            the bulk of their production to the Netherlands West Indies of Curacao
                            and Aruba, respectively, for refining and transshipment.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that the above reasoning is correct, I would hesitate to bring
                            this matter to the attention of the Foreign Minister at present as an
                            inducement for Venezuela to enter into a trade agreement with the United
                            States, because he has stated to me, as reported in my telegram No. 68
                            of June 14 [<hi rend="italic">No. 64 of May 21, 6 p.m.</hi>],<note
                                n="18a" xml:id="d758fn18a">Corrected on basis of despatch dated June
                                21, from the Minister in Venezuela.</note> that he was not
                            interested in a possible concession in respect to oil. The attitude of
                            the Venezuelan Government in this regard, after considerable study, now
                            seems to be that what happens to shipments of petroleum after they leave
                            Venezuelan shores is a matter which concerns the oil companies and not
                            the Venezuelan Government. Efforts of the latter, as I have reported
                            before, are now directed toward a policy of having refineries
                            established in this country.</p>
                        <p>I assume that the above mentioned 67 percent of Venezuela’s total direct
                            exports to the United States is based on valuation rather than weight
                            and in this connection I may venture a further remark.</p>
                        <p>The only document definitely known to accompany oil shipments to the
                            United States from Venezuela is the ship’s manifest, and if total
                            exports are computed on the basis of that document they represent an
                            arbitrary value fixed by the Venezuelan Collector of Customs. It is
                            understood that this arbitrary valuation is approximately twice the
                            actual value of the oil, so that unless otherwise corrected a
                            considerable inaccuracy would creep into the figures for Venezuela’s
                            direct oil exports to the United States. Until further information on
                            this subject is made available to the Legation, I shall not attempt to
                            discuss the question with the Foreign Minister.</p>

                            of June 15, 1937, transmitting a copy with translation of an alternative
                            draft, dated June 1937, of general provisions of a reciprocal trade
                            agreement as proposed by the Venezuelan Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to present to the Minister a note incorporating the
                            substance of the enclosed draft, and at the same time to convey to him
                            orally the substance of the second paragraph of the Department’s
                            instruction No. 184 of June 11 last. The Department requests also that
                            you report by telegraph the date of presentation together with any minor
                            changes in the text of the note which you might have considered
                            appropriate, as it is the intention of the Department to present a copy
                            of the note to the Venezuelan Minister in Washington following
                            presentation in Caracas.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your despatch No. 747 of June 18, 1937, the Department
                            notes that you question the importance of a concession with respect to
                            petroleum in a reciprocal trade agreement with Venezuela. It may be
                            stated in this regard that, as you are probably aware, Government
                            officials in Venezuela and the Venezuelan Minister in Washington have at
                            various times indicated the definite interest of the Venezuelan
                            Government in import taxes imposed by this Government upon Venezuelan
                            petroleum. It would seem, therefore, that notwithstanding
                            representations that may have been made to the Legation appearing to
                            indicate an indifference towards possible concessions by this country in
                            connection with the importation of Venezuelan petroleum, the matter is
                            deemed by the Venezuelan Government to be of sufficient significance in
                            the Venezuelan economy to cause the Government of that country to attach
                            considerable importance to such a concession in any possible
                            negotiations for a trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to inform Your
                                Excellency that I have transmitted to my Government the alternative
                                draft general provisions of a possible reciprocal trade agreement
                                between the United States and Venezuela which Your Excellency was
                                good enough to present <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0788"/>to
                                me on June 14 last, and to say that my Government has directed me to
                                make the following statement:</p>
                            <p>It has been gratifying to the Government of the United States to
                                learn from the draft general provisions dated June 1937, and
                                recently submitted by the Venezuelan Government, that the
                                governments of the two countries are in accord with respect to a
                                substantial part of the provisions of a reciprocal trade agreement.
                                The Government of the United States has been particularly pleased to
                                find in the first part of Article VI of the draft general provisions
                                a recognition of the most-favored-nation principle as applied to
                                imports into the two countries. It has also been pleased to note
                                that Article IV provides for national and most-favored-nation
                                treatment with respect to internal taxes and charges.</p>
                            <p>It has been noted, however, that the third limitation placed upon the
                                first part of Article VI of the draft general provisions submitted
                                by the Venezuelan Government would appear to render the
                                most-favored-nation principle with respect to imports non-applicable
                                in “situations created by trade agreements whereby one of the
                                contracting parties obtains from another country advantages in
                                return for equivalent concessions.” It is assumed, however, that in
                                drafting Article VI of the draft general provisions, the Venezuelan
                                Government did not intend to propose that the United States would
                                not be given the benefits granted to other countries by Venezuela in
                                trade agreements with them, for the United States has in the recent
                                past been given assurances by the Venezuelan Government of its
                                disposition to continue to grant to the United States unconditional
                                most-favored-nation treatment. Further evidence to support this
                                assumption is found in the position assumed by the Venezuelan
                                Government at the international conference at Montevideo in 1933 and
                                at the recent Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace
                                at Buenos Aires, endorsing and supporting the principle of equality
                                of treatment in international trade.</p>
                            <p>As the Government of the United States has previously indicated, it
                                will be disposed to make a preliminary public announcement
                                concerning a trade agreement with Venezuela and to discuss the
                                schedules, as well as details of the general provisions, of such an
                                agreement as soon as the Venezuelan Government has agreed to accept
                                the unconditional most-favored-nation principle as a basis for the
                                general provisions.</p>
                            <p>The Venezuelan Government is, of course, aware that the Government of
                                the United States has in the past four years been urging the
                                reduction of restrictions upon international commerce and the
                                removal of inequality of treatment of the kind arising from
                                exclusive bilateral agreements, the benefits of which are confined
                                to the parties entering <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0789"
                                />into the agreements. As its part, the Government of the United
                                States has developed a program of reciprocal trade agreements based
                                upon the unconditional most-favored-nation principle. Since 1934,
                                the United States has concluded sixteen such agreements, and at the
                                present time it is negotiating and exploring the possibilities of
                                additional agreements. It has been the policy of the Government of
                                the United States to extend the concessions granted in these
                                agreements to other countries of the world provided that they are
                                not discriminating against American commerce.</p>
                            <p>It is of great moment at this time that important commercial nations
                                such as Venezuela continue to, give support to the liberal forces of
                                the world which are today endeavoring to widen the adoption of the
                                policy of equality of treatment as an indispensable basis of any
                                substantial and permanent improvement in world commerce and in
                                international good-will, as contrasted with a policy of conditional
                                treatment, involving discrimination, ill-feeling, and unfavorable
                                reactions upon the countries providing discriminatory treatment. The
                                Government of the United States would for this reason, as well as
                                because of the bearing upon a reciprocal trade agreement between the
                                two countries, particularly welcome the continued cooperation of
                                Venezuela in the efforts which the United States is making towards
                                the objective of improving the condition of international
                                commerce.</p>

                        <p>In an informal discussion of the proposed reciprocal trade agreement
                            between the United States and Venezuela, the Foreign Minister stated
                            that given a certain amount of good will on both sides, he was confident
                            that an accord might be reached in spite of the differences between the
                            two drafts. He did not, however, display the same eagerness and interest
                            in connection with the agreement which he had shown at the initiation of
                            discussions; he pointed out that the United States was already receiving
                            most favored nation treatment from Venezuela and that the recent
                            appreciation in the exchange rate of the bolivar amounted to a
                            substantial reduction in the customs duties on American products. He
                            therefore felt that from the point of view of the United States there
                            would actually be nothing further to be <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780"
                                facs="0790"/>gained by a trade agreement, and it was obvious that he
                            saw little advantage to Venezuela in such a treaty.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the general purposes and underlying philosophy of Secretary
                            Hull’s trade agreements program, and to the desirability of Venezuela
                            becoming a party to the movement for international peace and
                            understanding which it represented, to which Dr. Gil Borges replied that
                            while he personally subscribed to those doctrines Venezuela was
                            compelled to face the world trade situation realistically. Citing the
                            recent commercial agreement between Colombia and Germany<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d760fn20">Clearing agreement signed May 21, 1937; for text,
                                see <hi rend="italic">Revista del Banco de la República</hi>, June
                                20, 1937, p. 197.</note> as an example, he stressed the present
                            tendency toward barter or compensation arrangements and said that
                            Venezuela could not afford to overlook such modern practices in
                            international trade. He said that Venezuela’s policy today was to bring
                            its commercial agreements up to date and that considering the nature of
                            the national economy it would be necessary to look toward methods of
                            trade similar to those adopted by other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then said that he saw only one serious difficulty in the way
                            of reaching an understanding with the United States in the matter of a
                            trade agreement—that of the unconditional most favored nation principle.
                            Speaking very confidentially, he said that in the case of Germany and
                            Italy, which imposed various restrictions and limitations on Venezuelan
                            trade, he was preparing to abandon the most favored nation principle
                            even though it might involve abrogating existing treaties, because he
                            did not feel his country was justified in according most favored nation
                            treatment to countries which did not reciprocate. In the case of
                            agreements with other countries, Venezuela proposed to revise the terms
                            of those agreements or else enter into new treaties which instead of
                            mentioning most favored treatment would contain barter or compensation
                            provisions. While the United States did not impose any restrictions on
                            Venezuela’s commerce, it was a question as to how far he could go in
                            entering upon a reciprocal trade agreement with it based on the
                            unconditional most favored clause, since that would be in conflict with
                            the policy to be adopted toward other countries.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Gil Borges said that he wished to make it clear that his attitude was
                            not due to any disinclination to proceed with the proposed reciprocal
                            agreement, or to any “ulterior motives” affecting the United States, but
                            that it was based entirely on the existing financial, commercial and
                            economic situation in Venezuela. This situation, he said, had
                            peculiarities which had to be taken into account and that in view of the
                            realistic commercial policy which his country was now committed to, he
                            could do no less than assume a position in keeping with the facts.</p>

                        <p>87. My despatch No. 743, June 15, 1937, and Department’s instruction No.
                            192, July 14, 1937.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs handed me today a note which translated
                            reads in part as follows: “My Government agrees to the omission of the
                            third paragraph of Article 6 from the alternative draft which I
                            communicated to Your Excellency, thus recognizing reciprocally
                            unconditional most-favored-nation treatment subject to the limitations
                            established in Article 6 of the said alternative draft”.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed the belief that with this important basic
                            principle agreed upon it should now be possible to make a preliminary
                            public announcement concerning the trade agreement and to proceed with
                            the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I shall send a despatch transmitting the full text of the Foreign

                        <p>48. Your telegram No. 87, August 30, 5 p.m. You are requested to inform
                            the Foreign Minister that the Department is gratified that substantial
                            agreement has been reached.</p>
                        <p>It is felt, however, that the reservation which the Venezuelan Government
                            apparently desires to make with respect to Puerto Rico and the Virgin
                            Islands (particularly in so far as it relates to the 30 percent customs
                            surcharge question) would constitute an important derogation from the
                            principle of most-favored-nation treatment. You should point out to him
                            that in accordance with the long-established policy of this Government,
                            all areas under the sovereignty and authority of the United States are
                            included in the most-favored-nation assurances of the commercial
                            treaties and agreements of the United States. Furthermore, you should
                            point out that Puerto Rico is a part of the customs territory of the
                            United States and, as such, is included within the scope of the duty
                            concessions, given by the United States in trade agreements. The
                            President himself has recently expressed in strong terms his view that
                            no distinction should be made between citizens of the United States
                            living on the mainland and citizens in our territories <pb n="782"
                                xml:id="pg_782" facs="0792"/>and insular possessions. It would
                            therefore be most difficult for the Department to justify the drawing of
                            such a distinction in a trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the Department at the earliest possible moment of the
                            reaction of the Venezuelan authorities to this statement and report
                            whether the situation described in your despatch No. 322 of June 18,
                                1936,<note n="22" xml:id="d762fn22">Not printed.</note> continues
                            unchanged.</p>
                        <p>For your own information, issuance of the preliminary announcement is
                            being deferred until a further study has been made of the 30 percent
                            surtax question. Should the Venezuelan authorities inquire as to the
                            Department’s plans with regard to the announcement, you may say that the
                            Department continues to be desirous of issuing it at the earliest
                            moment, but in view of the importance of this matter in relation both to
                            the unconditional most-favored-nation principle and the established
                            policy of the Government of the United States towards its territories
                            and insular possessions, the Department believes that the Venezuelan
                            Government will understand the necessity for some further study and
                            discussion of this matter prior to public announcement of contemplated
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>89. Department’s telegram No. 48, September 4, 3 p.m. The Foreign
                            Minister in an interview today expressed his perfect understanding of
                            the Department’s point of view and promised to study the matter in the
                            hope of finding a satisfactory solution. He intimated that he might be
                            willing to propose as a compromise the removal of the 30 percent
                            surcharge from products originating in Puerto Rico and the Virgin
                            Islands while transshipped goods would continue to pay the surcharge. I
                            believe this is as far as he would be willing or able to go.</p>

                            reservation to mean that the Venezuelan Government, under a trade
                            agreement, would accord most-favored-nation treatment to products, the
                            growth, produce or manufacture of Puerto Rico exported to Venezuela, and
                            in conformity therewith, would remove the 30 percent surcharge from such
                            products. This Government is happy to accept this offer of the
                            Venezuelan Government even though it does not fully meet this
                            Government’s desires in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Although the Foreign Minister’s Note, quoted in your telegram No. 93,
                            makes no mention of the Virgin Islands, it is thought that the omission
                            may be unintentional in view of your telegram No. 89 of September 8. You
                            should inquire as to this and inform the Foreign Minister that it is
                            hoped that the Venezuelan Government’s intention is to extend to
                            products originating in the Virgin Islands treatment <pb n="784"
                                xml:id="pg_784" facs="0794"/>similar to that extended to Puerto
                            Rican products. If you find that the omission of the Virgin Islands was
                            intentional, you should point out the negligible amount of exports from
                            the Virgin Islands to Venezuela, and the undesirability of the products
                            of the Virgin Islands receiving different treatment from that accorded
                            Puerto Rican products. In the event the Foreign Minister appears
                            disinclined to yield with respect to the Virgin Islands, you should
                            inform him that, in view of the relatively minor importance of the
                            matter, this Government is willing to leave the question of the Virgin
                            Islands for further discussion during the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Inform the Foreign Minister that the Department is prepared to issue
                            preliminary announcement of contemplated negotiations within the next 10
                            days, if agreeable to the Venezuelan Government. In the event the
                            Venezuelan Government wishes to make a simultaneous announcement at
                            Caracas, the Department will inform you of the exact date of the
                            issuance of the announcement here.</p>
                        <p>The preliminary announcement will include the statement that at a later
                            date public announcement will be made of the products under
                            consideration as subjects for concessions to be granted to Venezuela.
                            This second announcement will constitute a formal invitation to our
                            domestic interests to submit briefs with respect to the listed products
                            and will set a date for public hearings before the Committee for
                            Reciprocity Information. Meanwhile, it is expected that negotiations
                            will actively be proceeding with a view to the conclusion of an
                            agreement as soon as practicable following completion of the
                            above-mentioned public hearings in this country which the Trade
                            Agreements Act requires.</p>
                        <p>If you find it advisable, you may point out to the Foreign Minister that
                            the foregoing involves only our own procedure here and that it does not
                            involve our making public announcement, prior to conclusion of the
                            agreement, of the products on which we shall seek concessions from
                            Venezuela.</p>

                        <p>97. Department’s telegram No. 53, September 30, 3 p.m. The Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs wishes the preliminary announcement to be made
                            simultaneously in Washington and Caracas and will advise <pb n="785"
                                xml:id="pg_785" facs="0795"/>within a few days when his Government
                            will be ready. He understands that the basis of the agreement on the
                            general provisions thus far reached is his own draft proposal of June 14
                            as subsequently amended respecting the most-favored-nation principle and
                            the inclusion of Puerto Rico. The final text might modify the form but
                            not the content of his draft thus amended. Kindly advise me if the
                            Department is of the same understanding, as there should be definite
                            agreement on this point before any announcement is made.</p>
                        <p>I anticipate no objection to the inclusion of the Virgin Islands in the
                            agreement. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is willing personally that
                            they be included on the same condition as Puerto Rico but must consult
                            other branches of his Government before giving his official consent.</p>

                        <p>56. Tour telegram No. 97, October 4, 4 p.m. You should inform the Foreign
                            Minister that, as has been stated on previous occasions, the Department
                            has not considered it necessary that the two governments should reach
                            definitive agreement on the general provisions prior to the public
                            announcement of contemplated trade agreement negotiations. The
                            Department has felt that once the two governments had agreed, as is now
                            the case, on the broad principles underlying such provisions, there
                            would be sufficient basis for negotiations and that any relatively less
                            important points of differences between the two drafts could be composed
                            during the negotiations. In view of the agreement already reached with
                            respect to the unconditional most-favored-nation principle as applied to
                            all forms of trade control measures, no insurmountable difficulties are
                            foreseen which would prevent final agreement on the general provisions.
                            It will be recalled that the Department did not request complete
                            acceptance of its draft general provisions by the Venezuelan Government
                            prior to preliminary public announcement. Nor has it examined the
                            Venezuelan draft general provisions with a view to giving a final
                            commitment with respect thereto prior to such announcement. The
                            Department believes that the Venezuelan Government will agree that it
                            would be difficult, if not impossible, for either government to attempt
                            to reach complete agreement as to the general provisions before any
                            consideration has been given to the schedules which will form an
                            integral part of the agreement. Moreover, in the case of the Government
                            of the United States, consideration must be given to any views <pb
                                n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0796"/>which may be presented at the
                            public hearing subsequent to public announcement before it will be in a
                            position to enter into a definite commitment concerning either the
                            general provisions or the schedules.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, the Department hopes that the Foreign Minister
                            will agree to an early date for the simultaneous issuance in both
                            capitals of public announcement that a trade agreement is contemplated,
                            leaving the composition of any remaining differences between the two
                            drafts of the general provisions to be worked out following such
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>For your information, the Department desires to make the preliminary
                            public announcement as soon as practicable and if possible to issue the
                            formal notice and complete the public hearings in the United States
                            before the end of the year.</p>

                            <item>In accordance with the customary procedure followed here, the
                                preliminary announcement will state that informal suggestions from
                                the public in this country, concerning products for consideration in
                                connection with the proposed trade agreement with Venezuela, will be
                                received by this Government for a period of 1 month following the
                                date of issuance of such announcement.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>As soon as practicable after the close of the aforementioned
                                period, the formal public notice of intention to negotiate a trade
                                agreement with Venezuela will be issued. A list of products on which
                                the United States will consider granting concessions to Venezuela
                                will be published with the formal notice, which fixes the dates for
                                the presentation of written briefs, and for the public
                                hearing.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Therefore, as soon as the preliminary announcement is made, you
                                should ask the Venezuelan Government to submit as soon as possible a
                                list containing descriptions of any products on which it is
                                interested in obtaining concessions. You should point out to the
                                Venezuelan Government, in this connection, that it is the general
                                practice of this Government to limit the concessions which it grants
                                to a country in a trade agreement to products of which that country
                                supplies a principal or important proportion of the total imports of
                                such products into the United States. With this in mind, the list
                                submitted by the Venezuelan Government should be comprehensive and
                                established with as great care as possible since once this
                                Government publishes a list along with the formal public notice, new
                                items cannot be added thereto without the issuance of an additional
                                public announcement giving opportunity for the presentation of
                                briefs and hearings.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>You should assure the Foreign Minister that the list of products
                                on which this Government will consider granting concessions to
                                Venezuela will not be published before it has been approved by the
                                Venezuelan Government. It should be clearly understood, however,
                                that the proposed publication of this list in connection with the
                                formal public notice will not constitute a commitment by this
                                Government to grant concessions with respect to all of the products
                                contained therein. The purpose of publishing the list is to give
                                notice to the American public of all products under consideration as
                                possible subjects for the granting of concessions to Venezuela in
                                order that all interested persons may know whether there is occasion
                                for presenting views.</item>

                            <item>As stated in the penultimate paragraph of the Department’s
                                telegram No. 53, September 30, 3 p.m., the procedure here does not
                                involve this Government’s making public, prior to the conclusion of
                                the agreement, the products on which concessions will be requested
                                from Venezuela.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>A tentative list of products on which concessions may be requested
                                from Venezuela is being sent you by air mail. If the Foreign
                                Minister requests it you may give him a copy of that list when he
                                furnishes the above-mentioned list of products on which Venezuela
                                desires concessions. In that event, however, you should explain to
                                the Foreign Minister that it is not possible to give him a
                                definitive list of products or to indicate the nature or extent of
                                the concessions desired thereon prior to the termination of public
                                hearings in this country. Subsequent to such hearings, the
                                Department will provide you with proposed Schedules I and II for use
                                in the negotiations.</item>

                            the Venezuelan Government. A copy of this list should be given to the

                            Department’s airmail instruction no. 223 of November 2, 1937,
                            transmitting a tentative list of products <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792"

                            the formal negotiations for a trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>In an informal meeting at the Legation November 10 to discuss a form of
                            procedure for the ensuing negotiations, Sr. Ramon Eduardo Tello, the
                            representative of the Ministry of Finance designated for this purpose,
                            stated that his Government would have ready for exchange on or before
                            November 25 a similar tentative list of products exported from Venezuela
                            to the United States which it would like to have included in the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed, subject to approval by the Department, that a period of
                            about three weeks should be allowed to elapse thereafter in which each
                            Government would have time to study the tentative list of the other and
                            prepare a second list, comprehensive and established with as great care
                            as possible, for exchange about December 15. Unless no obstacle then
                            appeared, the Venezuelan Government would approve the publishing of this
                            second list in connection with the formal notice by the United States
                            Government fixing the dates for the presentation of written briefs and
                            for the public hearings.</p>
                        <p>I shall forward by airmail as soon as it is received the tentative list
                            of the Venezuelan Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            no. 870 of November 13, 1937, and to report that this morning I
                            exchanged with Sr. Ramon Eduardo Tello, the representative of the
                            Ministry of Finance, preliminary lists of the products for discussion in
                            the trade agreement negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Venezuelan list, a copy and translation of which I enclose
                                herewith,<note n="26" xml:id="d774fn26">Not printed.</note> is very
                            general in character, and represents, according to Sr. Tello, a
                            compendium of the petitions that have been received by the Ministry of
                            Finance as a result of the preliminary announcement issued on October
                                26,<note n="27" xml:id="d774fn27">Department of State, <hi
                                    rend="italic">Press Releases</hi>, October 30, 1937, p.
                                323.</note> as well as various suggestions from other Ministries.
                            The very nature of its compilation may therefore explain the fact that
                            no petroleum product is included, though as I have previously pointed
                            out the Venezuelan Government has been cold to the suggestion that a
                            concession on petroleum would be of any real benefit to this
                            country.</p>
                        <pb n="793" xml:id="pg_793" facs="0803"/>
                        <p>The Ministry of Finance expects to have its list in shape for publishing
                            within approximately three weeks, prepared in the detail necessary for
                            specific classification under the appropriate heads of the United States
                            Customs Tariff. I have provisionally arranged, therefore, for an
                            exchange of more definitive lists for this purpose about December
                            15.</p>
                        <p>In elucidation of some of the items on the preliminary Venezuelan list,
                            the representative of the Ministry of Finance furnished supplementary
                            information which I have included in the translation in brackets
                            immediately following the respective items concerned.</p>
                        <p>A number of interviews have been held at the Legation during the past two
                            weeks with representatives of American manufacturers concerning various
                            articles enumerated on the Department’s preliminary list and concerning
                            some which it may be desirable to add to the list. Short studies are
                            being prepared regarding these items and will be forwarded to the
                            Department at the earliest possible opportunity. The following are the
                            articles suggested for inclusion on which a request for concession would
                            appear to be the most justifiable: <list>
                                <item>Cosmetics (only those items in which the United States
                                    furnishes the major part)—principally included in Tariff Nos.
                                    366 A, C and I.</item>

                        <p>It is noted that the Department has included on its list both oil base
                            paints and varnish base paints. The representative of the Du Pont paints
                            has pointed out that the former pay only Bs. 0.50 today as opposed to
                            Bs. 1.50 levied on the latter; that the American shipments consist
                            primarily of the varnish-base type, and that any reduction in the duty
                            on oil base paints could not but prejudice sale of the latter. He
                            recommends very strongly that no concession be sought under the
                            circumstances on oil-base paints.</p>

                        <p>67. Your despatch no. 870, November 13. The Department does not intend to
                            add to its tentative list of products on which concessions <pb n="794"
                                xml:id="pg_794" facs="0804"/>are desired, prior to the holding of
                            public hearings following the next public announcement, but it has no
                            objection to the Venezuelan Government revising within the next few days
                            the list which it is now presenting to you. You should say to the
                            Venezuelan authorities, however, that it is hoped that the Venezuelan
                            Government may find it possible to expedite any revision of its list in
                            order that the second public announcement may be made at an early
                            date.</p>

                        <p>109. My despatch No. 882, November 24. The representative of the Ministry
                            of Finance informed me yesterday that the cabinet had decided to request
                            no concession on petroleum as it believed the United States would ask in
                            return therefor concessions on American products corresponding in value
                            to Venezuelan petroleum exports to the United States. The Venezuelan
                            Government will not consider bargaining on this basis. If the Department
                            wishes to reassure the Venezuelan Government on this point it is
                            possible that petroleum may be added to the list.</p>
                        <p>Please instruct by telegraph.</p>

                        <p>71. Your telegram no. 109, December 11, noon. You should point out to the
                            appropriate Venezuelan officials that, in possible anticipation of the
                            Venezuelan list, the products under consideration by this Government for
                            possible trade agreement concessions to Venezuela, constituted in 1935
                            more than 90 percent in value of total United States imports from
                            Venezuela. On the other hand, the products contained in this
                            Government’s tentative list, handed the Venezuelan Government, on which
                            trade agreement concessions may be requested from Venezuela, constituted
                            in 1935 only about 41 percent of United States exports to Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>According to United States figures total imports into the United States
                            from Venezuela in 1935, were valued at $21,455,377. Products under
                            consideration by this Government for possible reductions and <pb n="795"
                                xml:id="pg_795" facs="0805"/>bindings in import taxes in a trade
                            agreement with Venezuela, were valued at about $19,610,000 in 1935.</p>
                        <p>Total United States exports to Venezuela in 1935 were valued at about
                            $18,390,000. The products contained on this Government’s tentative list,
                            on which either bindings or reductions may be requested from Venezuela,
                            were valued at about $7,585,000 in 1935.</p>
                        <p>From the above figures it is evident that this Government has not
                            approached the question of granting or requesting duty concessions on
                            the basis of a narrow balancing of volume of trade involved in
                            concessions granted and concessions obtained. In fact to do so would be
                            inconsistent with this Government’s policy as embodied in trade
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>The policy of this Government in negotiating trade agreements is to
                            obtain the reduction or amelioration of restrictive barriers to
                            international trade and thereby expand trade along natural lines. In
                            considering possible trade agreement concessions, this country has in
                            general followed the rule of principal supplier. In selecting the
                            products included in its tentative list for submission to the Venezuelan
                            Government, this Government was largely guided by this country’s
                            position in regard to such products, in the Venezuelan market. It is to
                            be expected that the Venezuelan Government will include in its list, now
                            being prepared, those products of which Venezuela is a principal
                            supplier in the United States market and with respect to which it
                            desires to maintain or increase its position in that market.</p>
