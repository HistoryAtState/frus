                <p>This volume of documents on the Second Quebec Conference (1944) completes the
                    special series of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes on the World
                    War II conferences attended by President Roosevelt or President Truman, along
                    with Prime Minister Churchill or Marshal Stalin, or both of the latter. Volumes
                    previously published in this series were entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                        Conferences at Washington, 1941–1942, and Casablanca, 1943; The Conferences
                        at Washington and Quebec, 1943; The Conferences at Cairo and Tehran, 1943;
                        The Conferences at Malta and Yalta, 1945;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                        Conference of Berlin</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Potsdam Conference</hi>),
                        <hi rend="italic">1945</hi>.</p>
                <p>Richardson Dougall, Deputy Director of the Historical Office, was the principal
                    editor of the present volume. Substantial preliminary work was done by Arthur G.
                    Kogan, Richard S. Patterson, and Irving L. Thomson. The volume was reviewed by
                    the undersigned.</p>
                <p>The technical editing of the volume was the responsibility of the Publishing and
                    Reproduction Services Division, Jerome H. Perlmutter, Chief.</p>
                <p>In order to make this volume as complete and accurate as possible, the editor
                    supplemented the documentation and data available in the Department of State by
                    obtaining source material and information from a number of agencies outside the
                    Department. The Historical Office would like to express its sincere appreciation
                    for their assistance. Particular acknowledgment is made of the extensive help
                    received from the Historical Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the
                    Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park, New York, and from the Treasury
                    Department. Material from the manuscript collections listed in the Introduction
                    to the volume has been included with the kind permission of the respective
                    owners and archival authorities, and quotations from published works have been
                    reproduced with the generous permission of the copyright owners. The British
                    Foreign and Commonwealth Office graciously made available a number of Quebec
                    papers which were referred to in United States documentation but which could not
                    be located in American files. The photographs were supplied through the courtesy
                    of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and the United States Army Audio-Visual
                    Agency.</p>

                <p>This volume presents documentation relating to the ninth conference participated
                    in by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill
                    after the United States became a belligerent in World War II—the Second Quebec
                    Conference of September 11–16, 1944, also known by its code name. <gloss
                        target="#t_Octagon1"><hi rend="smallcaps">Octagon</hi></gloss>—together with
                    papers on the Roosevelt–Churchill conversations which took place at Hyde Park,
                    Few York, immediately following the Quebec Conference.</p>
                <p>Advisers, both civilian and military, assisted Roosevelt and Church ill at
                    Quebec. The conferees were concerned with planning for the final stages of the
                    war both in Europe and in the Far East, so that documentation on military
                    subjects bulks large. But Prime Minister Mackenzie King, Secretary of the
                    Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, Lord Cherwell,
                    and Sir Alexander Cadogan participated in the top-level political discussions at
                    Quebec, in preparation for which the State, War, and Treasury Departments
                    prepared a considerable amount of background documentation. Additional and
                    extensive background information on the subjects discussed at Quebec has
                    previously been published in the annual volumes of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations of the United States</hi> and in the series <hi rend="italic"
                        >United States Army in World War II</hi>, published by the Department of the
                    Army.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Organization of the Volume</hi></p>
                <p>The volume opens with a chapter on agenda and arrangements for the Second Quebec
                    Conference, followed by a chapter containing substantive preparatory papers,
                    divided among eight subjects. This chapter includes pre-conference papers later
                    circulated or discussed at Quebec as well as official background memoranda and
                    recommendations prepared specifically for possible use at Quebec. These back
                    ground chapters are followed in turn by a log of the President’s visit to
                    Canada.</p>
                <p>The chapter on proceedings of the <gloss target="#t_Octagon1"><hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Octagon</hi></gloss> Conference is organized
                    chronologically by meetings. Every meeting known to have been attended by a
                    senior American official is accounted for. All minutes and memoranda of
                    conversation at the international level <pb n="XII" xml:id="pg_XII" facs="0016"
                    />are included; where none was found, the editor has supplied an editorial note
                    embodying what information was available on that particular meeting. There were
                    no general meetings of the United States delegation, but information on
                    President Roosevelt’s consultations with his advisers has been included. The
                    chapter on proceedings is followed by the conference documents and related
                    papers, arranged by subject, concluding with the final documents of the <gloss

                    Conference.</p>
                <p>At the end of the Second Quebec Conference, Prime Minister Churchill visited the
                    President at the latter’s home at Hyde Park on September 18–19, 1944. The final
                    chapter of the present volume includes all the documentation that has been found
                    relating to their conversations there.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Unpublished Sources</hi></p>
                <p>Since the Second Quebec Conference dealt to a very large extent with questions
                    outside the jurisdiction of the Department of State, the editor sought and
                    obtained the assistance of several other Government departments and agencies in
                    gathering much of the source material for this publication. Of particular
                    importance were the Presidential papers in the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at
                    Hyde Park; the papers of Presidential Assistant Harry L. Hopkins and of
                    Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., also located in the Roosevelt
                    Library; military papers in the files of the Department of Defense (principally
                    in the files of the Joint Chiefs of Staff); papers on financial questions and on
                    the postwar treatment of Germany in the files of the Treasury Department; and
                    documents on cooperation with the United Kingdom in the field of atomic energy
                    research in the files of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The
                    Roosevelt Library provided photocopies of all Roosevelt, Hopkins, and Morgenthau
                    papers that could be found relating to the Quebec Conference. The Department of
                    Defense provided all papers that could be found documenting the official
                    position or advice of the War Department on politico-military subjects discussed
                    at the international level, as presented by the civilian leaders of that
                    department and by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of Staff, as
                    well as excerpts from the minutes of a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at
                    Quebec which were needed for an understanding of the international
                    discussions.</p>
                <p>The papers printed in this volume which are in the Central Files of the
                    Department of State are indicated by means of a file number in the headnote, in
                    the usual style of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>. The provenance of

                    These volumes include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions within the range of the Department of State’s responsibilities,
                    together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which contributed to
                    the formulation of policies. When further material is needed to supplement the
                    documentation in the Department’s files for a proper understanding of the
                    relevant policies of the United States, such papers should be obtained from

                            given, the very greatest advantages might be derived from our close
                            talks about all matters including any address to the Germans by you.
                            This meeting is also becoming a practical necessity in respect of the
                            Chiefs of Staff. We have the whole Far Eastern Campaign to discuss and
                            our execution of our promise to help in it to the very utmost of our
                            strength. We need you here so much as the great battle will be of a
                            profound and heart-shaking character, not by any means only in its
                            opening phase. The King will of course send you a formal invitation at
                            any moment that you let me know. There is a very good place in London
                            which would give you perfect safety and comfort. I greatly desire to see
                            you again. It is six months since we met.<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">The

                            better for me not to come in to the United States as you approach the

                        <p>We suggest that the first attempt should be to arrange a meeting between
                            us three at Invergordon, where each could have his battleship <pb n="11"
                                xml:id="pg_11" facs="0065"/>as headquarters besides a suitable house
                            on land. The King would entertain us before, after or during the meeting
                            either at Langwell, which he could borrow from the Duke of Portland, or
                            at Balmoral if a night journey is acceptable.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2"
                                >Langwell and Balmoral are located in Caithness and Aberdeenshire,
                                respectively. Of the two, Langwell is the more accessible from
                                Invergordon.</note> The weather might well be agreeable in Scotland
                            at that time. Secrecy, if desired, and security in any case, can be
                            provided. <gloss target="#t_UJ1">U.J.</gloss> might be able to fly or

                            in Washington. I wholly agree that we three should meet but it would be
                            a lot easier for me if we could make it the tenth or fifteenth of
                            September. This is just before the Equinox. I am rather keen about the
                            idea of Invergordon or a spot on the west coast of Scotland. I like the
                            idea of the battleship. This would get me back in plenty of time for the
                            election, although that is in the lap of the Gods. I am sending a

                        <p>Personal and secret to the President from Harry L. Hopkins.</p>
                        <p>I have been thinking a good deal about the forthcoming conference. It
                            seems to me it would have been to your advantage to have gone most
                            anywhere to meet <gloss target="#t_UncleJoe1">Uncle Joe</gloss> and
                            Churchill together but, in the light of <gloss target="#t_UncleJoe1"
                                >Uncle Joe</gloss>’s message,<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">The
                                reference is to Stalin’s negative reply of July 22, 1944, to
                                Roosevelt’s message of July 17 concerning a possible tripartite
                                meeting. See <ref target="frus1945Malta#pg_4"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Foreign Relations</hi>, The Conferences at Malta and Yalta,
                                    1945, p. 4</ref>.</note> it seems to me that you have nothing to
                            gain by going to see Churchill. The world will, I believe, construe a
                            conference in England or Europe between you and Churchill alone as a
                            political meeting with Russia out in the cold.</p>
                        <p>I assume that there are important matters which you might well want to
                            take up with Churchill soon but I think it would be far better to have
                            Churchill come to you rather than have you go to him at this particular
                            time and I am inclined to believe that the sooner the conference could
                            be held the better.</p>
                        <p>Obviously <gloss target="#t_UncleJoe1">Uncle Joe</gloss> wants the next
                            meeting with you after Germany has collapsed.</p>

                            <item>I have a very bad report on the climatic conditions in Bermuda in
                                the first or second week of September. It is said to be extremely
                                hot and steamy whether ashore or afloat. There is also a persistent
                                southerly wind reported very sticky and unpleasant. I most deeply
                                regret your inability to visit Scotland. The King seemed very much
                                disappointed when I told him. However, I quite see that, with Stalin
                                not coming, you may wish to defer this promised visit. I, therefore,
                                recommend the <gloss target="#t_Quadrant1"><hi rend="smallcaps"

                                There are several serious matters in the military sphere which must
                                be adjusted between our staffs. I, too, would greatly welcome a few
                                frank talks with you on matters it is difficult to put on paper. We
                                have to settle the part the British Empire should take in the war
                                against Japan after Germany’s unconditional surrender. The situation
                                in Burma causes me much anxiety. We have suffered very heavy losses
                                through disease and the prospect of the whole forces of the British
                                Indian Army being tied down indefinitely in the worst part of the
                                country is unattractive. Other tangled questions arise about the
                                position of Alexander’s army in Italy including whether it is to be

                                and thus stripped of all initiative. It is impossible to resolve
                                these thorny matters by correspondence and I am sure that, if we and
                                the staffs were together, good working agreements could be
                                reached.</item>

                            someone to keep me right on the facts and figures. I am, therefore,
                            bringing Lord Cherwell for this part of our work which would not be till

                                smallest possible numbers, the British Chiefs of Staff inform me
                                they can manage with only about fifteen officers who need actually
                                take part in the conference. However, it is indispensable for me and
                                the Chiefs of Staff to take with us sufficient staff for the day to
                                day conduct of the war and for carrying on the government of Great
                                Britain. Observing that our absence from Headquarters may be any
                                thing up to three weeks, I shall have to have my full cypher staff,
                                map room, etc. I cannot conceive how this will, in any way, get in
                                your way or trouble you. You must remember that the United States
                                Chiefs of Staff will not be away from Washington much more than a
                                week and a few hours in an aeroplane can bring them any assistance
                                they wish. I hope, therefore, that this will be agreed to.</item>

                        <p>The President is delighted that the <gloss target="#t_Prof1"
                                >Prof</gloss><note n="1" xml:id="d32fn1">Lord Cherwell.</note> is
                            coming. He, however, has not changed his original belief that the
                            conference should be on the Teheran scale. He thinks it would be a great
                            mistake to take over a hotel like the Frontenac during the tourist
                            season and, under any circumstances, is anxious to have a small,
                            intimate staff conference along with his meeting with you. He
                            understands, of course, that you must have a cypher staff and he,
                            naturally, will have his own. I do hope you can agree on a conference of
                            this size. It is necessary for us to have your final decision as to the
                            number and composition of your party at the earliest possible date in
                            order that we may complete our plans.</p>
                        <p>The President feels that it would be a great mistake to have news paper
                            men all over the place. They will inevitably, no matter what they are
                            told relative to a communiqué after the conference is over, be demanding
                            press releases every day. The President hopes that no newspaper men will
                            be imported into Quebec from anywhere and that the news of the
                            conference will rest on a communiqué to be issued at the conclusion of
                            your talks.</p>
                        <p>I think it is very important that this be fully understood in Canada.</p>

                            very great number of import[ant] affairs from day to day it will be
                            necessary to have considerable numbers of persons for that purpose. For

                            Administration 6. Clerical 42. Cipher staff 30. Royal Marine Guard 36.
                            There will also be a small contingent from our element in Washington.
                            These however are only the machinery with which I carry on my work and
                            without which I could not leave the country. You have all your great
                            departments immediately under your hand a few hours away by air.</p>

                        <p>Fred Leathers tells me he will attend forthcoming top level conference

                        <p>3. As to the future: continuous employment against the enemy will have to
                            be found for the Eighth and Fifth Armies once the German armies in Italy
                            have been destroyed or unluckily made their escape. This employment can
                            only take the form of a movement first to Istria and Trieste and
                            ultimately upon Vienna. Should the war come to an end in a few months,
                            as may well be possible, none of these questions will arise. Anyhow, we

                        <p>56. Personal and secret to Prime Minister Mackenzie King from Harry L.
                            Hopkins.</p>
                        <p>The President’s Secretary, Stephen Early, has today conferred at length
                            with your Mr David Dunton. Also attending the conference, were
                            representatives of our Office of War Information.</p>
                        <p>Early told Dunton of the President’s wishes in regard to press, radio and
                            photography.</p>
                        <p>I think you should know at once that the President has wired Churchill
                            telling him he thinks it would be a great mistake to take over the whole
                            of the Hotel Frontenac at such a time as this<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2"
                                >See <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_21">p.
                                21</ref>.</note> and that he is sure security can be properly
                            maintained if two or three floors are taken over.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the President feels that it would be a great mistake to have
                            newspapermen all over the place and that the newspapermen should know
                            that only a communiqué, after the conference, will be issued. The
                            President is afraid they will be demanding press releases every day. He,
                            therefore, hopes that no newspapermen will be specially invited into
                            Quebec from anywhere and that the news of the conference will rest on a
                            communiqué to be issued at the conclusion of the talks.<note n="3"

                        <p>You will, no doubt, hear directly from Churchill of this but I wanted to
                            acquaint you with the President’s position.</p>

                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I fully share the President’s view that it would be undesirable
                                    at this time to take over the whole of the Château Frontenac
                                    though I am told that the physical layout of the hotel would
                                    make it difficult to shut off a particular section or floors of
                                    the building. However I have instructed Mr. Coleman who is in
                                    charge of local arrangements to go into the matter very
                                    carefully with the management on Monday.</p>
                                <p>“As regards representation of the press, I may say that I have
                                    already assured Mr. Churchill that the Canadian authorities will
                                    do everything they can to carry out his own and the President’s
                                    wishes in this matter. I have suggested to Mr. Churchill (and a
                                    copy of my message<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">Not

                                    no special arrangements are to be made for newspaper men who may
                                    insist on being present at Quebec while the meetings are taking
                                    place, it will be necessary to inform the Canadian newspapers in
                                    confidence and in advance of the meetings that it is the express
                                    wish of the President and Mr. Churchill that the news of the
                                    conference should rest on the communiqué to be issued at its
                                    conclusion. I assume that similar advice will be given in
                                    Washington and London to United States and United <pb n="34"
                                        xml:id="pg_34" facs="0088"/>Kingdom newspapers and news
                                    services which may expect to have representatives at Quebec
                                    during the meetings. I feel that I should perhaps make it clear
                                    that no newspaper men were invited to Quebec at the time of the
                                    last meeting by any Canadian authority. In fact my recollection
                                    is that they were all explicitly warned that no hard news could
                                    be expected during the meeting and that speculative reports
                                    could only be harmful. I shall gladly see that such warnings are
                                    given again and more strongly, but I should not like to leave
                                    you or the President under any possible misapprehension that

                                    at Quebec as being on Teheran scale, with 15 or 20 people in his
                                    party and as many in Churchill’s, was received at Ottawa only
                                    today.</p>
                                <p>“I am informed by our officials who are at the moment in Quebec
                                    concerting accommodation arrangements with representatives of
                                    your Government and the United Kingdom Government, that
                                    accommodation will be required for 260 members of the United
                                    States Chiefs of Staff party, and perhaps 40 in the White House
                                    party, and I understand that the United Kingdom party, which is
                                    already en route, is about 225. These numbers are on almost
                                    exactly the scale of last year’s meeting, and will require the
                                    same accommodation, i.e., practically the whole Château
                                    Frontenac. I might also say that, according to our information,
                                    press enquiries about accommodation at Quebec indicate that the
                                    number of newspapermen intent on being present, despite all
                                    discouragements, is likely to be at least as great as last
                                    year.</p>
                                <p>“As you know, I have been very anxious to see that the Canadian
                                    end of the arrangements for the meeting should follow exactly
                                    what the President and Mr. Churchill had in mind. I take it that
                                    any misunderstandings there may have been about the size of
                                    staffs and the accommodation required for them have already been
                                    cleared up. I should, however, be glad to hear from you that the
                                    arrangements now in hand have been explained to the President
                                    and are agreeable to him.</p>

                            He agreed with the proviso that Admiral Willson be supplied with

                            question. He finally agreed. I confirmed our previous discussion about
                            the possibility of a change in the Prime Minister’s position and he said
                            that he would be ready to discuss this with him at Quebec if we found it

                        <p>I then told the President of the possibility of Cadogan being called to
                            Quebec. Mr. Hull thought this would be bad and the President felt so
                            strongly about it that he said that if Churchill spoke of having a
                            diplomat come that he would suggest Eden … During this conversation, Mr.
                            Hull got the incorrect impression that the President was talking about
                            Eden taking Cadogan’s place in Washington while Cadogan was in Quebec
                            and objected violently to such a procedure. We of course straightened
                            this out. I suggested that I be authorized to press for <gloss

                            wished me to make every effort to persuade Cadogan not to leave the
                            meeting. …</p>

                        <p>I then raised with the President the importance of his having political
                            advisers with him at meetings such as the forthcoming one at Quebec, in
                            the event that political questions would be discussed. The President
                            agreed that this was sound and important but said the forthcoming <pb

                            nature. He did, however, promise to send for Mr. Hull if the discussions
                            took a political turn. I later asked Mr. Hull if he thought I had spoken
                            out of turn and he said no, that it was wonderful.</p>

                            Italy. We may also soon have the populous North flowing on to our hands.

                            which could be announced, comprising resumption of their export trade,

                            early on Monday, 18th, and stay with you Monday and Tuesday. We could
                            then have anyone necessary to wind up outstanding points. I must depart

                        <p>I have asked Eden to come over if possible tomorrow, so he should be here
                            on Thursday or Friday. There are several important things to discuss
                            with him including recognition of the French Provisional Government, as
                            to which I am by no means convinced, I do not know whether you would
                            require to have Hull or Stettinius for Friday, 15th.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important things I have to discuss with you is <gloss

                            matter is considered of extreme and vital importance by the British

                            strictest confidence that Cadogan had received a cable from Churchill
                            asking him to come to Quebec and that he had asked my advice and opinion
                            on the matter, and whether, if he went, we would be offended. I reported
                            that I had told him we would have no objection to his flying up and
                            spending the evening there if he could come back the next day. There was
                            considerable discussion as to whether we should suggest that the
                            President ask Church ill not to call him up, but this was entirely
                            inconclusive. The point of view was also expressed that this changed the
                            entire character of the Quebec conference from one of a military nature
                            to one of a political nature and it was very serious to be having a
                            political conference without Stalin present. Incidentally I informed the
                            group that the President had assured me that if the British called any
                            political men to Quebec he would do likewise.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3"

                        <p>Early in the day I had a discussion with the Secretary on the voting
                            procedure and also on the question of Cadogan’s being ordered to Quebec.
                            I also told him of the possibility that Eden was coming to Quebec. Mr.
                            Hull made the same point which was made at the American meeting by Mr.
                            Long, that changing the character of the meeting in a political
                            direction, and probably discussing the future of Europe without Stalin
                            being present was quite a serious matter. …</p>

                        <p>The Secretary thinks that it would be most unfortunate if Cadogan goes to
                            Quebec, not only from the point of view of our Conversations at <pb
                                n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0099"/>Dumbarton but that it would throw
                            that conference into a discussion of general diplomatic and political
                            affairs. He asked me to do everything in my power to keep him from
                            going.</p>

                        <p>I talked privately with Cadogan and Jebb in the early afternoon …
                            [Cadogan] inquired if Mr. Hull had heard from the President about going
                            to Quebec and I told him he had not. …</p>

                        <p>Later in the afternoon I had another private talk with him on the
                            question of his going to Quebec. He immediately prepared a cable to his
                            Prime Minister saying that Mr. Hull felt it would be a mistake for him
                            to go as it would arouse all types of speculation in the press in this
                            country. He said in the cable that if the Prime Minister felt keenly
                            about it he hoped he would discuss it with the President. Cadogan handed
                            me the wire and I suggested that he take out the word “terrific”. He had
                            originally used the expression that Hull thought it would be a terrific
                            mistake.</p>

                        <p>Cadogan called me right after midnight to say that while the Prime
                            Minister had given him twenty-four hours of grace yesterday, in view of
                            Eden’s arrival he now felt obligated to go to Quebec immediately and
                            assumed that under the circumstances Mr. Hull could now have no
                            objections. I told him that I felt that any decision he made now should
                            be entirely his own. He said he did not think it would interfere too
                            much with the Conversations inasmuch as little could probably be done in
                            the next day or so in any event pending an evaluation by our respective
                            Governments on the informal compromise formula on voting.<note n="2"

                        <p>Cadogan called me again at 10 o’clock in the morning saying he had just
                            received a further telegram asking him to go there, and he was planning
                            to leave later in the morning by special plane and that he would return
                            tomorrow. …<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">Portions of the Stettinius record

                        <p>I called Mr. Hull early in the morning and told him of Cadogan’s midnight
                            call about going to Quebec. Mr. Hull again said that he thought it was a
                            mistake for Cadogan to go and for that conference to get into political
                            matters but that he agreed that we would not make a further point of the

                            Quebec and did not feel in any event that he should go. This comment was
                            made after I had reminded him of the President’s promise to send for him
                            or someone else in the Department if the conference went into political

                        <p>Harry Hopkins called me just before 11:00 in the morning and I reported
                            to him the recent development, particularly on the voting question. I
                            also told him that Cadogan was going to Quebec this morning and that
                            Eden was arriving there late this afternoon. I told him about our
                            proposed press statement.<note n="5" xml:id="d71fn5">On September 14
                                Stettinius released a statement to the press indicating that Cadogan
                                had been called to Quebec to see Churchill “on important matters not
                                in any way connected with the talks at Dumbarton Oaks”. See

                        <p>He then told me it was expected that the Quebec conference would break up
                            Monday [<hi rend="italic">Friday?</hi>] night and that probably the
                            Prime Minister and the President would go to Hyde Park Sunday night and
                            that if Eden went probably Hull would be invited up.<note n="6"

                                to Hyde Park (see Eden, p. 554), and Hull did not go either. On
                                September 16 Stettinius discussed with <gloss target="#t_Halifax1"
                                    >Halifax</gloss> and Cadogan in Washington the possibility that
                                Stettinius and Cadogan might go to Hyde Park to discuss with
                                Roosevelt and Churchill the question of voting in the Council of the
                                proposed world organization, but when Stettinius telephoned
                                Roosevelt on September 17 about the possibility of coming to Hyde
                                Park for this purpose, the President discouraged him. See Notter

                            <p>This problem is, of course, of great importance and considerable
                                urgency, for until an American policy has been decided upon with
                                regard to the future treatment of Germany, we are not in a position
                                to discuss the matter with the British or Russians. I hope,

                                <p>The following discussion of the treatment of Germany makes a
                                    distinction between (1) long-range interests and objectives of
                                    the United States and (2) the problems of the occupation
                                    period.</p>
                                <p>The latter category embraces those immediate concerns of the
                                        <gloss target="#t_Victor1">victor</gloss> powers from the
                                    moment of Germany’s surrender or collapse until <pb n="54"
                                        xml:id="pg_54" facs="0108"/>a time when it will be safe to
                                    establish a permanent system of controls and to permit the
                                    organization of a constitutional German Government. The major
                                    tasks of this period will be (1) to secure through the surrender
                                    instrument and to exercise an unqualified authority over
                                    Germany, (2) to establish the machinery of an effective military
                                    government, (3) to destroy the National Socialist Party and
                                    uproot its influence from German life, (4) to disarm and
                                    demobilize the German military machine and establish controls
                                    over Germany’s war potential, (5) to institute a program of
                                    restitution and reparation, (6) to prevent an economic breakdown
                                    and to begin an economic reorganization which will destroy
                                    autarky and eliminate, in so far as possible, the economic and
                                    social bases of ultra-nationalism and militarism, and (7) to
                                    make a start towards the creation of an acceptable and durable
                                    political structure in Germany.</p>
                                <p>If this program is to provide more than temporary security and is
                                    to prepare the way for continuing European stability and peace,
                                    it must be worked out and applied in the light of long-range
                                    objectives with respect to Germany and to Germany’s place in the
                                    projected world order.</p>
                                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">ii. long-term interests and
                                        objectives of the united states</hi></p>
                                <p>Axiomatically the basic long-term interest of the United States
                                    is peace, and so far as Germany is concerned, consequently, the
                                    basic objective is to see to it that that country does not
                                    disturb the peace.</p>
                                <p>Security against a renewal of German aggression must be
                                    guaranteed during the foreseeable future—not only during but
                                    beyond the occupation period—through a rigorously enforced
                                    prohibition of a German military establishment and through
                                    vigilant control of German war potential.</p>
                                <p>An indefinitely continued coercion of more than sixty million
                                    technically advanced people, however, would at best be an
                                    expensive undertaking that would afford the world little sense
                                    of real security and, more important still, there exists no
                                    convincing reason to anticipate that the <gloss
                                        target="#t_Victor1">victor</gloss> powers would be willing
                                    and able indefinitely to apply coercion. In the long run,
                                    therefore, the best guarantee of security, and the least
                                    expensive, would be the German people’s repudiation of
                                    militaristic ambitions and their assimilation, as an equal
                                    partner, into a cooperative world society.</p>
                                <p>These considerations dictate the search for a policy which will
                                    pre vent a renewal of German aggression and, at the same time,
                                    pave the way for the German people in the course of time to join
                                    willingly in the common enterprises of peace.</p>
                                <p>The long-range objectives which might best protect the interests
                                    of the United States include (1) the settlement of disturbing
                                    frontier <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0109"/>problems, (2)
                                    the achievement of political and economic reform within Germany,
                                    and (3) a constructive role for Germany, both political and
                                    economic, in international relations.</p>
                                <p rend="flushleft">A. <hi rend="italic">Frontiers</hi></p>
                                <p>In order to strengthen the forces of peace throughout the world,
                                    it is a continuing interest of the United States that the
                                    significance of frontiers be reduced through the development of
                                    international organization and of freer international economic
                                    relations. In the establishment of post-war boundaries, the
                                    objectives of the United States can be best served by
                                    territorial settlements which, by doing least in justice to the
                                    peoples of all the states concerned, offer the most reason able
                                    prospect of general acceptance and stability. In the case of
                                    Germany the principles of minimum change and minimum grievance
                                    apply fairly well to her northern, western and southern
                                    boundaries.</p>
                                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">With Denmark</hi>.—The existing
                                    Danish-German boundary has not been challenged by the Danes, and
                                    there is no apparent reason to propose a change.</p>
                                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">With the Netherlands</hi>.—No adjustment of
                                    the Netherlands land boundary seems desirable since it has
                                    heretofore been no source of disturbance. The Netherlands
                                    Government, however, has a justified claim for the relocation of
                                    the boundary in the Ems Estuary in the main channel rather than
                                    along the western shore as has been maintained by Germany in
                                    contravention of an established principle of international law.
                                    Unofficial Netherlands spokesmen have recently threatened to
                                    claim compensation in adjacent German territory if the German
                                    army should destroy the dikes and flood the reclaimed lands of
                                    their country.</p>
                                <p>Further study is being given to the question of possible
                                    territorial compensation in such an event.</p>
                                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">With Belgium</hi>.—There appears to be no
                                    convincing reason why the 1920 line should not be restored. The
                                    justice of the Belgian frontier as established in 1920 was
                                    attacked by the Germans, and the pre-1914 line was restored in
                                    1940. Despite Belgian abuse of the open plebiscite, the
                                    inhabitants of the disputed region had generally become
                                    reconciled to Belgian authority.</p>
                                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">With France</hi>.—The United States
                                    Government is committed to the restoration of Alsace–Lorraine to
                                    France. Since there are no strong forces, either political or
                                    economic, working toward the creation of a separate state, or
                                    federation, composed of French, German, Luxembourg, Belgian and
                                    other territories within the watershed of the Rhine River, it
                                    would be undesirable for this Government to support such a
                                    proposal.</p>
                                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">With Austria</hi>.—It is recommended that
                                    the present administrative boundary be maintained as the
                                    international frontier. After the <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56"
                                        facs="0110"/>absorption of Austria, the German Government
                                    made a slight rectification of the old frontier—now an
                                    administrative boundary—for reasons of convenience rather than
                                    for political motives. There is no cause to restore the pre-1938
                                    boundary unless that should be desired by the 2000 inhabitants
                                    of the small Sonthofen area, which is shut off by mountains from
                                    close contact with Austria.</p>
                                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">With Czechoslovakia</hi>.—It is recommended
                                    that the pre-Munich frontier be restored without prejudice to
                                    any rectifications which the Czechoslovak Government might wish
                                    to propose as part of a broader settlement of the issues in
                                    dispute between Czechoslovakia and Germany.</p>
                                <p>Since a viable Czechoslovakia, to whose restoration this
                                    Government is committed, must include a substantial German
                                    population, it is believed that the pre-Munich frontier with
                                    Germany should in principle be restored on grounds of historic,
                                    legal and strategic considerations. Such a conclusion is without
                                    prejudice to any cessions in the six northern salients (area,
                                    772 square miles; population, 320,000, about 96 percent German)
                                    which the Czechoslovak Government might wish to negotiate with
                                    Germany or to slight rectifications in favor of Czechoslovakia.
                                    If such rectifications should be arranged by the two Governments
                                    concerned, this settlement could be approved by this Government,
                                    which is not committed to support any specific boundaries.</p>
                                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">With Poland</hi>.—The principle of minimum
                                    grievance will be fairly well attained by the dispositions
                                    indicated above. In the case of the Polish-German frontier that
                                    principle may have to be overridden. To strengthen Poland
                                    strategically and economically and to compensate it for
                                    prospective losses of territories in the East, the Polish
                                    Government urges, with Soviet and British support, that East
                                    Prussia, Danzig, and a portion of German Upper Silesia should be
                                    ceded to Poland, and will probably insist that the approximately
                                    3.4 million German inhabitants of the ceded areas should be
                                    transferred to Germany. The Soviet Government with apparently
                                    some British support, has suggested the cession of additional
                                    German territory up to the Oder River.</p>
                                <p>A basic question which has arisen in acute form is whether this
                                    Government should enter into active negotiations with the
                                    British and Soviet Governments with a view to determining a new
                                    Polish-German boundary or whether it should disclaim interest in
                                    this question and refrain from expressing approval or
                                    disapproval of a settlement agreed upon by its two major allies
                                    and Poland. If it is determined that this Government should play
                                    an active role, two questions arise. The first is whether a
                                    settlement of the future Polish boundaries should be negotiated
                                    now or be treated as part of the final peace settlement.</p>
                                <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0111"/>
                                <p>The second is whether this Government should admit the principle
                                    of the acquisition by Poland of territories containing large

                                    loss of only partially Polish-inhabited territories to the
                                    Soviet Union or for strategic and economic reasons.</p>
                                <p>Regardless of whether the United States takes an active or
                                    passive role with respect to the disposition of East Prussia,
                                    Danzig and Upper Silesia, it is recommended that the United
                                    States not encourage the cession of German territory in the
                                    lower trans-Oder region. The strategic considerations advanced
                                    in support of such an annexation are difficult to justify since
                                    no frontier arrangement between the two states could of itself
                                    suffice to maintain Poland’s security against German
                                    aggression.</p>

                                    problem closely related to that of establishment of equitable
                                    frontiers is presented by the presence of considerable German
                                    minorities in the various states of Eastern Europe. In
                                    particular, the Czechoslovak Government has indicated a desire
                                    to transfer a substantial number of the 3,200,000 Germans from
                                    that state; Poland will wish likewise to remove the Germans from
                                    Poznań, as well as from newly acquired territories; Yugoslavia
                                    may desire to take similar action.</p>
                                <p>These German minorities became the advance guard of National
                                    Socialist penetration, and the states which they helped to
                                    deliver to Hitler have a well-founded grievance against them.
                                    Their transfer to Germany would probably contribute to the
                                    tranquility of the countries concerned. Hitler himself has set
                                    an example by numerous forced migrations of the peoples of this
                                    region of Europe.</p>
                                <p>The problem, however, is one of enormous proportions. Serious
                                    economic injury would be done if these people should be
                                    summarily uprooted from their homes and thrown into Germany
                                    without compensation for their possessions and without provision
                                    for livelihood. By land reform in Germany it would be possible
                                    to absorb perhaps one million of the immigrants into
                                    agriculture. The great majority would have to enter urban life
                                    and would cause considerable strains unless there were an
                                    expanding German economy accompanied by an increase in foreign
                                    trade.</p>
                                <p>It is recommended, because of the above consideration, that this
                                    Government oppose the mass transfer of these peoples immediately
                                    upon the cessation of hostilities. It will perhaps be desirable,
                                    however, to sanction the relocation of individuals and groups
                                    who have constituted a special problem.</p>

                                    only by the continuous coercion of Germany would be a precarious
                                    and expensive one at best, it must be an objective of the United
                                    States to promote in Germany the largest degree possible of
                                    internal stability based on free institutions, on the
                                    psychological disarmament of the German people, and on tolerable
                                    economic conditions.</p>
                                <p>The most plausible hope for lasting political reconstruction and
                                    orderly development lies in the establishment of a democratic
                                    government, despite serious difficulties facing such an attempt.
                                    It is therefore recommended that the aim of American policy
                                    should be to prepare the German people for self-government as
                                    early as that may be compatible with the operation of security
                                    controls over Germany and with the functioning of a general
                                    system of international security.</p>
                                <p>The survival of a new democratic regime will depend in
                                    considerable measure on the psychological disarmament of the
                                    German people as well as on a tolerable standard of living.
                                    Although a democracy will labor under a heavy burden because of
                                    its necessary submission to the will of the victors, it must be
                                    able to offer some claim on German pride and patriotism purged
                                    of its aggressive content. In order to encourage a constructive
                                    fresh start in German political life, the United States should
                                    favor holding out the prospect that a democratic Germany, by
                                    demonstrating its ability and intention to act as a peace-loving
                                    nation, can earn an honorable place in the society of nations.
                                    In order to avoid raising an issue similar to that which, after
                                    1919, was exploited by the nationalists to discredit and destroy
                                    all attempts to promote liberalism and international
                                    cooperation, this Government should oppose writing into the
                                    surrender terms or the peace settlement a verdict of moral guilt
                                    against the German people as a whole.</p>
                                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Partition</hi>.—It is recommended that this
                                    Government oppose the forcible partition of Germany. (Referred
                                    to the Secretary for possible consideration with the
                                    President.)</p>

                                <p>An imposed dismemberment of Germany into two or more separate
                                    states has been advocated as a practicable means of forestalling
                                    any renewal of German aggression. Such a measure, however
                                    drastic in itself, would not obviate the necessity of imposing
                                    and enforcing far-reaching security controls upon Germany for an
                                    indeterminate future, whether Germany is left united or is
                                    divided. Moreover, because of the high degree of economic,
                                    political and cultural integration in Germany, it must be
                                    anticipated that partition would not only have to be imposed but
                                    also maintained by force. Such a drastic interference in German
                                    life would evoke a vastly increased resentment over and above
                                    the inevitable discontent with defeat and its consequences. The
                                        <gloss target="#t_Victor1">victor</gloss> powers, by
                                    imposing partition, would take on themselves a burdensome and
                                    never-ending task of preventing surreptitious collaboration
                                    between the partite states and of restraining the nationalistic
                                    determination to reunite, which would, in all probability, be
                                    the response of the German people. Finally, the disruption of
                                    German economic unity would carry with it grave dangers for the
                                    economic stability of Europe as a whole, and not merely to
                                    Germany.</p>
                                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Political Decentralization</hi>.—It is
                                    recommended that every feasible effort should be made to promote
                                    a return to a federal system of government and a division of
                                    Prussia into a number of medium-sized states.</p>
                                <p>In reaction to National Socialist over-centralization, the
                                    Germans will probably return, of their own accord, to a
                                    considerable degree of federal decentralization, including the
                                    breakup of Prussia, which in 1938 included 62 percent of the
                                    area and two-thirds of the population of Germany, into several
                                    states of moderate size.</p>
                                <p>Two risks may, however, be incurred by going beyond encouragement
                                    of decentralization. The first is that an imposed weakening of
                                    the governmental structure more sweeping than that favored by
                                    the moderate and liberal parties in Germany would, like an
                                    imposed dismemberment, provide a ready-made program for the
                                    nationalistic groups. The second risk is that a weak central
                                    authority would be unable to cope with the social and economic
                                    problems of post-war adjustment. In addition, a return to wide
                                    provincial autonomy might again offer to undesirable elements an
                                    advantageous means of penetrating the various state governments,
                                    as happened prior to 1933, when the National Socialists captured
                                    control of several of the smaller states. Finally, even the
                                    cumbersome federalism of the Bismarckian empire was no
                                    protection against the growth of German power and militarism.
                                    Too much importance should not be attached to movements for
                                    decentralization, in any case, for the democratic forces have
                                    generally favored greater unification of the Reich.</p>

                                    long-range interest of the United States that Germany be

                                    concern of this Government, therefore, is that Germany for the
                                    indefinite future be forbidden the manufacture and import of
                                    arms, ammunition and implements of war and be denied the right
                                    to develop an economically unsound productive capacity
                                    convertible to war purposes. This interest points to the
                                    termination of an autarkic policy and to the assimilation of
                                    Germany, without discrimination other than that necessary for
                                    security controls, into world economy, the maximum reduction of
                                    the economic significance of frontiers and the development of
                                    responsible international agencies for transportation, power,
                                    and other functions. It is equally to the interest of this

                                    such international economic organizations and agencies, but
                                    should not be permitted to use foreign trade or commercial
                                    relations as an instrument of nationalistic policy.</p>
                                <p>In the interest of eliminating the social and economic bases of
                                    re current militarism, it is recommended that this Government
                                    approve a program for destroying the privileged positions of the
                                    Junker estate owners and of the great financial and industrial
                                    monopolies. The problem of the Junkers can be solved by breaking
                                    up the large landed estates; the problem of financial and
                                    industrial monopoly could be met in part through disestablishing
                                    the top financial structures of the great industrial combines
                                    and redistributing the ownership of constituent operating
                                    companies, and in part through some effective form of public
                                    control exercised through a democratic regime. It is also
                                    possible that nationalization of certain industries would
                                    contribute to the elimination of militarism and of political and
                                    economic abuses arising from the excessive concentration of
                                    economic power in private hands. Moreover, this Government
                                    should oppose the development of new forms of industrial
                                    combinations, whether on a German or international basis, which
                                    could contribute to renewed German economic and political
                                    aggression in Europe.</p>
                                <p>Further study is to be undertaken of ways and means of
                                    implementing these recommendations with respect to landed
                                    estates and industrial concentration.</p>
                                <p>It is recommended that this Government propose allowing the
                                    German people, subject to such requirements as those outlined
                                    above, to determine the nature of their economic system. It is
                                    to the interest of the United States to see in Germany the
                                    revival of free labor organizations enjoying ultimately the
                                    rights of association and of collective bargaining. (See also

                                <p>The position of post-war Germany in world affairs will be
                                    conditioned largely by the success or failure of international
                                    cooperation for security and prosperity and by the degree to
                                    which Germany demonstrates its abandonment of aggressive and
                                    totalitarian ambitions. Although deprived for an undefined
                                    future of all military power, Germany will remain the most
                                    populous and productive country in Europe to the west of Russia.
                                    Germany would present a danger to peace only if the victors
                                    should fall out among themselves and if either Russia or Great
                                    Britain should try to bring Germany into its orbit. The best
                                    guarantee against such a development would therefore lie in the
                                    continued cooperation of the three principal victors in their
                                    treatment of Germany and in the solution of other problems, and
                                    in the early establishment of a general international
                                    organization within which the security of Germany, like that of
                                    other nations, would be assured.</p>
                                <p>In the post-war period Germany will presumably be debarred by its
                                    own weakness and by the continuing resentment of its smaller
                                    neighbors from pursuing independently any regional policy in
                                    Europe. If, however, European economic interests can be served
                                    by promoting, on a non-discriminatory basis, commercial
                                    exchanges between Germany and its neighbors to their mutual
                                    benefit and without undue advantage to Germany, this Government
                                    should be prepared to view such a development with equanimity.
                                    It is probable, however, that Germany’s overseas trade will play
                                    a much larger part than before in an economy reoriented away
                                    from war and the pursuit of autarky. Germany should not be
                                    permitted to use trade policy as an instrument of
                                    aggression.</p>
                                <p>It is recommended that the United States encourage the earliest
                                    possible integation of Germany into the community of
                                    peace-loving nations and into world commerce through holding out
                                    to a reconstructed Germany the prospect of early admission to
                                    the general international organization and of participation
                                    without discrimination in world trade.</p>

                                <p>This Government, by public commitment, demands the unconditional
                                    surrender of Germany.</p>
                                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Psychological Result</hi>.—The exaction
                                    of an admission of total defeat might prevent the invention of
                                    new legends about the alleged invincibility of German arms.
                                    Against this future advantage is to be weighed the immediate
                                    disadvantage of the fact that German propaganda, by

                                    destruction, is encouraging the resistance of the German people
                                    and is to that extent prolonging the war.</p>

                                        Powers</hi>.—The basic problem of the surrender is the
                                    establishment of a firm legal basis for the authority and acts
                                    of the <gloss target="#t_Victor1">victor</gloss> powers. The
                                    traditional rights of military occupation do not give all the
                                    authority that is necessary for dealing with unforeseen
                                    contingencies and for effecting the reforms prescribed by
                                    long-term objectives. It is open to question whether an
                                    assertion of rights of conquest would provide a more
                                    satisfactory legal basis. In any case, unconditional surrender
                                    of a state is an innovation which requires exact definition
                                    before unusual rights can be derived incontestably from it.</p>
                                <p>It would seem essential, therefore, that the terms written into
                                    the surrender instrument, rather than conventional rights of
                                    occupation or the rights of conquest, be the source of the
                                    authority of the victors, provided there is a German Government
                                    capable of signing, and that the instrument contain a clear and
                                    comprehensive statement of that authority.</p>

                                <p>Previous statements of American policy and the draft terms of the
                                    Joint Chiefs of Staff have adopted the former interpretation.
                                    The British draft likewise embodies this definition. The Soviet
                                    view, on the other hand, is that the surrender instrument should
                                    contain primarily the military terms designed to render Germany
                                    incapable of renewing hostilities with the understanding that
                                    other provisions relating to political and economic matters
                                    should subsequently be imposed on Germany. In Soviet opinion,
                                    German military leaders would more readily accept military terms
                                    and would, if confronted with the sweeping demands of the
                                    American draft, use them to spur the German people to renewed
                                    resistance. It may be said in criticism of the Soviet approach
                                    that it would not assure to the victors an adequate legal basis
                                    for such measures as the punishment of war criminals, the
                                    abolition of the Nazi dictatorship, the reordering of German
                                    economy, etc., which are among the aims of this country.
                                    Furthermore, the political after-effects of increasing the
                                    stringency of the surrender terms step by step would perhaps
                                    play into the hands of nationalistic agitators against the peace
                                    settlement, as that procedure did after the last war.</p>

                                        Document</hi>.—In the discussions of the European Advisory
                                    Commission, question has arisen over whether the surrender
                                    document should contain detailed provisions or be limited to a
                                    general acknowledgment of the comprehensive rights of the
                                    victors and the unqualified obligations of the vanquished.
                                    Proponents of the longer instrument argue that German acceptance
                                    would be more readily given to it than to a “blank-check”
                                    instrument and that it would expressly obligate Germany to a
                                    complete range of military, political, and economic stipulations
                                    without limiting the freedom of the victors. The Joint Chiefs of

                                    in turn, that a comprehensive surrender of powers makes specific

                                    stipulations in the surrender document would carry with it the
                                    implication of a limitation of powers to the provisions
                                    specified. They attribute certain difficulties in Italy to the
                                    restrictive character of the long document used there and
                                    contend that the application of the broad authority can best be
                                    effected by ordinances of the occupation commanders. The
                                    American position is in favor of a short document, and it is
                                    probable that the British Government will accept one if there is
                                    agreement on proclamations and ordinances designed to give
                                    effect to the surrender terms.</p>

                                    transfer of the full powers implicit in unconditional surrender
                                    can be effected only by the German Government, and the signatory
                                    or signatories should be duly authorized, therefore, by the
                                    Government. For psychological reasons it is desirable that the
                                    instrument likewise be signed on behalf of the German High
                                    Command and by as important an officer as can be found. In case
                                    of the existence at the time of a Nazi or quasi-Nazi Government,
                                    the signature of a highly placed civilian representative would
                                    be equally desirable. If a moderate regime is in power at the
                                    time of surrender, it might well be advisable to compel the
                                    military alone to bear the onus of signing. A military
                                    signature, however, would have to be authorized by whatever
                                    government was in power at that time.</p>

                                    signed instrument should be ratified by the German Government.
                                    Since no official can sign away more authority than he legally
                                    possesses, the unqualified legality of the sweeping delivery of
                                    powers through surrender will depend in German eyes on whether
                                    it is properly authorized by the Government in power at the
                                    time. It is recommended that the surrender instrument be
                                    ratified by whatever German Government is in power at the time
                                    of surrender.</p>

                                        Rights</hi>.—Whatever arguments might be advanced for
                                    vesting the rights over Germany in all of the states at war with
                                    it, the practical necessities for prompt action, and the
                                    responsibilities of the three major powers, make such an
                                    arrangement impossible. The real issue, therefore, is whether
                                    the rights surrendered by Germany should be transferred to the
                                    United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Governments
                                    jointly, or to each of them separately. A provision in the
                                    surrender instrument explicitly naming the three powers as joint
                                    recipients would have the advantage of binding the three
                                    Governments to act jointly in the post-surrender treatment of
                                    Germany, and would help to avoid the confusions and suspicions
                                    which would arise if each had the right to deal separately with
                                    the defeated enemy. The disadvantage of vesting these powers in
                                    all three Governments jointly is that no one of them would, in
                                    theory at least, be allowed to act unless all three Governments
                                    were in agreement. On balance, however, the likelihood of
                                    bringing about a policy of uniform action towards Germany would
                                    be improved by vesting power over Germany in the three
                                    Governments jointly, and this alternative is consequently
                                    recommended.</p>
                                <p>The rights and powers accruing from the surrender of Germany are

                                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Administrative Machinery</hi>.—Since the
                                    main responsibility for the occupation of Germany must rest with
                                    the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, a
                                    basic problem arises as to how the interests and policies of the
                                    three powers are to be coordinated. The choice of a form of
                                    administrative machinery appears to lie between (<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) a unified tripartite system, (<hi
                                        rend="italic">b</hi>) a completely separate and independent
                                    administration in each of three zones, and (<hi rend="italic"
                                        >c</hi>) an inter mediate arrangement.</p>
                                <p>Uniformity of procedure throughout Germany would be most easily
                                    obtained, and undue exercise of influence by any one of the
                                    occupation authorities would be most effectively forestalled, if
                                    there were a smoothly working unified tripartite control.
                                    Linguistic and other difficulties, however, appear to argue for
                                    separate zones to be administered by each of the three armies of
                                    occupation. Such an arrangement, while avoiding local friction,
                                    would pose the problems of uniform security measures and general
                                    coordination of policy in the treatment of Germany as a whole. A
                                    strict application of the second alternative, by suddenly
                                    breaking the normal unity of the land, might easily lead to
                                    economic and social catastrophe. If prolonged prostration is to
                                    be avoided, the essential administrative functions and <pb

                                    operated on a national basis will need to be left intact and a
                                    high degree of uniformity maintained in the administration of
                                    any separate zones that may be established.</p>
                                <p>This Government has recommended the creation of a tripartite
                                    civil affairs agency for Germany to coordinate the military
                                    government of the proposed three zones of occupation. This plan
                                    emphasizes the consultative and advisory role of the tripartite
                                    board and the reservation of full administrative powers to the
                                    commander of each zone acting under direction of his own
                                    military superior. A British plan, questioning the adequacy of a
                                    purely advisory agency for coping with the highly unified
                                    administration of so many aspects of German life, proposes the
                                    establishment of a tripartite administrative board possessing
                                    the authority, within the limits of the agreement of the three
                                    Governments, to direct the application of approved policies to
                                    Germany as a whole. This proposal would limit the duty of the
                                    zonal commanders primarily to that of enforcing the
                                    administrative regulations of the central tripartite organ.</p>
                                <p>The American plan, approved by the Department of State and
                                    presented to the European Advisory Commission, is general in
                                    character. Further clarification as to whether the tripartite
                                    agency should be primarily consultative or should constitute a
                                    genuine joint administrative authority will be needed.</p>
                                <p>It is recommended that this Government favor the establishment of
                                    a tripartite organization with authority to direct the uniform
                                    administration of the whole of Germany.</p>

                                <p>This recommendation is made on the grounds that (<hi

                                    arrangement which would make each zone contiguous to Berlin is

                                <p>A further problem is presented by the allocation of the zones.
                                    The plans hitherto advanced agree in assigning the eastern zone
                                    to Soviet command. The British and Soviet proposals assign the
                                    northwestern zone to British command and the southern to
                                    American control. The President has stated, however, that,
                                    because of convenience of access, American troops should control
                                    the northwestern zone.</p>

                                    developments are assessed, it is tentatively recommended that
                                    this Government favor the first alternative. Direct military
                                    government will probably be necessary because of prospective
                                    internal confusion and would, in any case, be an effective means
                                    of impressing the totality of defeat on the German mentality. If
                                    a quasi-Nazi or military group should be in power at the time of
                                    surrender, it would be desirable to have that regime bear the
                                    onus of admitting defeat and of executing the orders of the
                                    occupation forces, but the procedure would entail the political
                                    limitation of dealing with a regime repugnant to the peoples of

                                    of moderates should gain control of Germany, there might be
                                    advantages administratively in working through it. Such a
                                    method, however, would have a very heavy disadvantage of
                                    exposing the moderates to the charge of being the tools of the
                                    allied powers. The moderates would have a better chance of
                                    survival in the court of popular German opinion if they came
                                    into power as the successors and supplanters of direct military
                                    government than as its instrument.</p>
                                <p>On the assumption of the probability of direct military
                                    government, it is further recommended that, as soon as military
                                    considerations cease to be paramount, the control of Germany
                                    should be transferred to an inter-allied civilian agency.</p>
                                <p>The importance of strictly military dispositions will tend to
                                    recede when the German forces have been disarmed and order is

                                    organized community of nations. It is believed that these

                                    the transfer of authority to the civilian agency, but merely the
                                    subordination of the military to the civilian.</p>
                                <p>The point at which civilian control should supplant the military
                                    cannot be determined now, but it is recommended that in
                                    principle the change be made as soon as the maintenance of

                                    process, would help to forestall the formation of a bloc of the

                                    maneuvers. It would likewise establish a pattern of cooperation
                                    looking forward to international organization.</p>

                                    probably more than 5 million members, about 2 million of whom
                                    are considered as “leaders”. To impose comprehensive

                                    to exclude a certain number of important Nazis. It consequently
                                    seems desirable to favor the exclusion from government office
                                    and from enjoyment of political rights of certain broad
                                    categories of Nazis rather than of all nominal members of the

                                    journalism, and from control of industrial and financial

                                    Association</hi>.—Upon the establishment of military government,
                                    the uncertainties of the first days will probably require a
                                    complete ban on political agitation and on the activities of
                                    political associations. Commitments require the lasting
                                    suppression of parties assuming the trappings of quasi-military
                                    organizations or espousing National Socialist ideals.</p>
                                <p>It is recommended, however, that as soon as military conditions
                                    permit, parties opposing Nazi and other kinds of
                                    ultra-nationalist ideology be permitted to organize and appeal
                                    for support. This recommendation is based on the conviction that
                                    the German people will need information, organization and public
                                    debate before they are prepared to decide their future form of
                                    government and that there is advantage in beginning these
                                    activities while National Socialism is under the immediate

                                        communication facilities; the prohibition or regulation of

                                    respect to a permanent German Government. Certain issues,
                                    however, merit consideration at this time.</p>
                                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Termination of Allied Government</hi>.—It is
                                    recommended that this Government favor the policy of terminating
                                    direct administration of the German governmental structure,
                                    whether by military or civilian agencies, as soon as prospects
                                    of order and the possibility of establishing an acceptable and
                                    competent German Government make its termination feasible. This
                                    recommendation would not affect the continued military
                                    occupation of Germany or the exercise of controls, by direct
                                    intervention if necessary, on the part of inter-allied
                                    agencies.</p>
                                <p>The duration of direct control, either military or civilian, will
                                    depend, among other things, on the continued need for order, on
                                    an assessment of the psychological effect of occupation
                                    government, and on an estimate of how ready the Germans are to
                                    organize a government. It may be anticipated that the major
                                    result of military government on German mentality will be
                                    achieved within a few months at the most. As they recover from
                                    the shock, the people may become progressively resentful over
                                    the delay in reviving their political activity, and friction
                                    would work to the advantage of the nationalistic elements. It is
                                    equally important, however, that the people should not give
                                    their decisive votes before an adequate period of public
                                    discussion has clarified the issues.</p>
                                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Procedures for Restoration of Permanent
                                        Government</hi>.—There are three general alternatives of
                                    procedure: (1) restoration of the pre-Hitler <pb n="72"
                                        xml:id="pg_72" facs="0126"/>Weimar constitution; (2) the
                                    convocation of a new constituent assembly; and (3) progressive
                                    extension of self-government from local units through the states
                                    to the federal Reich as the success of each step seemed assured.
                                    The principle of continuity would be observed by returning to
                                    the original Weimar text. Yet that document, while a good
                                    rational product, was not an organic part of German life, and it
                                    is doubtful if the mass of Germans would wish to go back to it.
                                    A new constitution drawn up after a decade of political
                                    sterility, however, might not prove a much more effective
                                    instrument. Fear has been expressed that an election for a
                                    constituent assembly as the first political experience of the
                                    German people would revive the old bankrupt political parties
                                    and focus all political attention on the central government to
                                    the detriment of healthy local and provincial political life.
                                    The third alternative, by reviving free local self-government,
                                    would provide a transition period in which the German people
                                    could develop new leaders and gain experience in democratic
                                    practice, central governmental functions being carried on
                                    meanwhile by civil servants under allied control.</p>
                                <p>If there is a period of direct military government, it is
                                    recommended that democratic self-government be established in
                                    local communities as soon as military necessities permit.
                                    Decision as to when the next step should be taken could
                                    profitably be made in consultation with responsible local
                                    leaders.</p>

                                    fidelity to their commitment to uproot National Socialism, the
                                        <gloss target="#t_Victor1">victor</gloss> powers will need
                                    to intervene in the process of reconstructing government to the
                                    extent of denying political rights to those categories of Nazis
                                    adjudged dangerous. An attempt positively to influence political
                                    decisions of the German people might be successful if the
                                    intervention were the joint work of the major powers, but in the
                                    course of time [the] habit of intervention, if developed, would
                                    probably outlive joint action, and, if so, Germany would become
                                    the hunting ground of competing influences and would be able to
                                    play off one rival against another, with disastrous consequences
                                    for any system of controls and for the peace.</p>
                                <p>These considerations point to the desirability of limiting
                                    positive influence to the encouragement of popular

                                <p>The Working Security Committee has now drafted a paper entitled
                                    “Statement of General Policies To Be Followed in the
                                    Administration of Germany”.<note n="20" xml:id="d73fn20">For the

                                            77</ref>.</note> This report will lay down the general
                                    policies to be agreed upon by the U.S., the U.K. and the
                                    U.S.S.R. on most important matters requiring agreement by the
                                    three powers for the administration of Germany after occupation.
                                    It is based upon the assumption that agreement will be reached
                                    on zones of occupation and control machinery.</p>
                                <p>It is anticipated that this paper will be submitted to the Joint
                                    Chiefs of Staff for their approval. If this approval is given,
                                    it will be possible for the Department to send to London a vast
                                    amount of detailed information respecting the policies to be
                                    applied in Germany after occupation.</p>

                                <p>The British authorities have prepared and submitted to the <gloss
                                        target="#t_EAC1">EAC</gloss> a number of directives covering
                                    policies to be followed in Germany upon occupation. In general,
                                    they cover much the same subjects as those which have been
                                    prepared in Washington and which are briefly described in the
                                    preceding paragraph. On a number of them, our views are not very
                                    different from those submitted by the British, but a certain
                                    amount of negotiation will no doubt be necessary before complete
                                    agreement is reached on all directives submitted by them.</p>
                                <p>In addition, Ambassador Winant’s Planning Group has likewise
                                    drafted a number of directives for consideration by the American
                                    authorities. The Working Security Committee is prepared to
                                    correlate the various statements that have been prepared as soon
                                    as the military members have received authority from the Joint
                                    Chiefs of Staff to operate under the statement of general
                                    policies described above.</p>

                                <p>The slowness in arriving at agreed policies on the treatment of
                                    Germany has resulted primarily from the unwillingness of the
                                    Russians to discuss the control machinery proposal until the
                                    zones of occupation are definitely decided. Without agreement on
                                    control machinery, it is difficult for the Department to make
                                    any real progress on the detailed planning. We have attempted
                                    through the Ambassador at Moscow to get the Russians to continue
                                    discussions, but without success to date.</p>

                                        against the <gloss target="#t_Gestapo1">Gestapo</gloss>. We
                                        should always have in mind the necessity of punishing
                                        effectively enough to bring home to the German people the
                                        wrongdoing done in their name, and thus prevent similar
                                        conduct in the future, without depriving them of the hope of
                                        a future respected German community. (Those are the two
                                        alternatives.) Remember this punishment is for the purpose
                                        of prevention and not for vengeance. An element in
                                        prevention is to secure in the person punished the
                                        conviction of guilt. The trial and punishment should be as
                                        prompt as possible and in all cases care should be taken
                                        against making martyrs of the individuals punished.</item>

                                    repatriation of other displaced persons. No priority with
                                    respect to repatriation should be established in advance by
                                    which the prisoners of any nation or nations will be favored.
                                    The time and order in which prisoners will be repatriated must
                                    be determined in the light of the situation existing after the
                                    collapse of Germany.</item>

                                        unconditional surrender of Germany has been recommended by
                                        the European Advisory Commission and has been formally
                                        approved by the American Government. It is anticipated that
                                        British and Russian approval will be forthcoming. These
                                        surrender terms are the outcome of prolonged negotiations in
                                        which considerable differences of opinion had to be ironed
                                        out. The surrender instrument is essentially a military
                                        document in which the German Government and the German High
                                        Command announces Germany’s unconditional surrender. The
                                        first eleven articles relate primarily to military
                                        dispositions and are supplemented by a general clause in
                                        which it is stated that the U.S., the U.K., and the U.S.S.R.
                                        will exercise supreme authority with respect to Germany and
                                        will pre sent additional, political, administrative,
                                        economic, financial and other requirements which the German
                                        Government, High Command and people will carry out
                                        unconditionally.</item>

                                        Russian, British and American troops. The Soviet forces will
                                        occupy the eastern zone, but whether British or American
                                        troops will occupy the northwestern and southern zones is
                                        not as yet decided. The protocol on occupation has therefore
                                        not been formally recommended by the <gloss target="#t_EAC1"

                                        has been agreed that Austria will be jointly occupied by the
                                        three powers with American military participation limited to
                                        a token force. The area of Greater Berlin will likewise be

                                <p>The fundamental question to be decided is what kind of a Germany
                                    do we want and what policies should be put into effect during
                                    occupation to attain our objectives. The most important of these
                                    problems are set forth below with an explanation of the State
                                    Department’s attitude to them: <list>

                                        <item><hi rend="italic">Partition</hi>. It must be explained
                                            at the outset that “partition” as used here does not
                                            refer to frontier adjustments or territorial amputations
                                            in the outer borders of the Reich. For example, the
                                            annexation of East Prussia and Danzig by Poland is not
                                            excluded in the recommendations set forth below on
                                            partition. By partition is meant the division of what is
                                            left of Germany into two, three or more independent
                                            states. While it can be argued that partition is not

                                        <item>The State Department is, in general, opposed to the
                                            forcible partition of Germany. An imposed dismemberment
                                            of Germany into two or more separate states has been
                                            advocated as a practicable means of fore stalling any
                                            renewal of German aggression. Such a measure, however
                                            drastic in itself, would not obviate the necessity of
                                            imposing and en forcing far-reaching security controls
                                            upon Germany for an indeterminate future, whether
                                            Germany is left united or is divided. More over, because
                                            of the high degree of economic, political and cultural
                                            integration in Germany, it must be anticipated that
                                            partition would not only have to be imposed but also
                                            maintained by force. The <gloss target="#t_Victor1"
                                                >victor</gloss> powers, by imposing partition, would
                                            take on themselves a burdensome and neverending task of
                                            preventing surreptitious collaboration between the
                                            partite states and of restraining the nationalistic
                                            determination to reunite, which would, in all
                                            probability, be the response of the German people.
                                            Finally, the disruption of German economic unity would
                                            carry with it grave dangers for the economic stability
                                            of Europe as a whole, and not merely to Germany. We
                                            should not, however, oppose any spontaneous German
                                            movements for partition.</item>

                                            in Germany and a division of Prussia into a number of
                                            medium-sized states. Prussia in 1938 included 62% of the

                                            many Germans would want to return to a considerable
                                            degree of federal decentralization, including the

                                <p>In the meantime, the State Department has received, in the course
                                    of drafting instruction[s] to its representative on the <gloss
                                        target="#t_EAC1">EAC</gloss>, various proposals from the
                                    military authorities which apparently contemplate the
                                    dismantlement or destruction of all German industry capable of
                                    pro ducing war material. Its objection is that such proposals
                                    contradict the general objectives quoted above, particularly
                                    paragraph 2. They would likewise presumably remove the
                                    possibility of extracting reparation goods from Germany,</p>
                                <p>The problem of German reparations is obviously closely linked to
                                    two others: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the level of subsistence
                                    which will be determined for the German people, and (<hi
                                        rend="italic">b</hi>) the extent to which German industry
                                    may be dismantled or destroyed either for the purpose of
                                    long-term security or for short-term reparation payment.</p>
                                <p>Therefore it seems essential that this Government should
                                    determine its basic policy and should decide at an early date
                                    what kind of economic structure it proposes to leave to Germany.
                                    If a far-reaching program of industrial destruction or
                                    dismantlement is agreed upon, it is apparent that, if put into
                                    effect, it will bring about extensive and important changes in
                                    European economy as a whole. Germany is a deficit country in
                                    foodstuffs and it is doubtful if a plan of making Ger many
                                    predominantly agricultural can be put into effect without the
                                    liquidation or emigration of X-millions of Germans. Germany is
                                    furthermore an important producer of certain raw materials,
                                    namely coal and bauxite, for Europe as a whole, not to speak of
                                    the vast amount of industrial goods which Germany normally
                                    exports. If we advocate a “wrecking program” as the best means
                                    of assuring our security, we may face considerable European
                                    opposition on account of its effect on European economy, and if
                                    we desire continuing reparations out of Germany, we shall
                                    eliminate any such program by a policy of destruction of German
                                    industry.</p>

                                        arranged for a meeting in his office on September 2 of
                                        officials of State, War and Treasury Departments. At this

                                        Department, Dr. Harry White from the Treasury, and Mr.

                                        interpretation of this plan which, in its general tenor, was
                                        more extreme than the memorandum itself. The plan
                                        contemplated the internationalization of the Rhineland
                                        together <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0147"/>with a strip
                                        of German territory extending through Westphalia, Hannover
                                        and Holgtein to and including the Kiel Canal. Poland would
                                        receive East Prussia and Upper Silesia; France would receive
                                        the Saar and German territory bounded by the Rhine and
                                        Moselle rivers. The remainder of the Reich would be divided
                                        into two independent states. In explaining this plan, Dr.
                                        White insisted that no trade would be permitted between the
                                        proposed international zone and the rest of the Reich, and
                                        he emphasized that the productivity of this zone should not
                                        in any way contribute to German economy. No recurrent
                                        reparations deliveries would be demanded and reparations
                                        would be dealt with by transfer of territory, equipment and

                                        some length how our views fitted into the British and
                                        Russian ideas to the extent which we were aware of them.
                                        After a lengthy discussion in which Mr. McCloy pointed out
                                        the difficulties which would arise for the military
                                        authorities under the Treasury plan, he stated that on many
                                        subjects there was a large area of agreement and he
                                        suggested that Mr. Riddleberger draft a memorandum for the
                                        Cabinet Committee which would include all points on. which
                                        there was obvious agreement. These points related primarily
                                        to the dissolution of the Nazi Party; the demilitarization
                                        of Germany; controls over communications, press and
                                        propaganda; and reparations. Mr. Riddleberger accordingly
                                        drafted this memorandum,<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn7"><hi

                                        is much to be hoped that the principal criminals may, before

                                    <item>I am strongly of opinion that the method by trial,
                                        conviction, and judicial sentence is quite inappropriate for
                                        notorious ringleaders such as Hitler, Himmler, Goering,
                                        Goebbels and Ribbentrop. Apart from the formidable
                                        difficulties of constituting the Court, formulating the
                                        charge, and assembling the evidence, the question of their

                                            question</hi>. It could not rest with judges, however
                                        eminent or learned, to decide finally a matter like this,
                                        which is of the widest and most vital public policy. The
                                        decision must be “the joint decision of the Governments of
                                        the Allies”. The Moscow Declaration, indeed, has already
                                        said so.</item>

                                    <item>I am equally clear that these leading and notorious
                                        criminals cannot be left untouched, while lesser people who
                                        have committed atrocities and war-crimes under their orders
                                        and with their approval are tried and heavily punished. Such
                                        a course would be universally, and rightly, condemned. It
                                        may not be essential to make a precise public announcement

                                        present—the Moscow Declaration is itself a general
                                        indication, and a new statement might evoke reprisals
                                        against Allied individuals in German hands—but it seems to
                                        me most desirable to open confidential consultations on the
                                        subject with some of our Allies, and to get a decision now
                                        as to what is to be done. Otherwise, when the time comes,
                                        there may be a disastrous difference of view.</item>

                                    Commissioner for Germany</hi></p>
                            <p>In addition to the subjects discussed above, the Cabinet Committee on
                                Germany might consider another most important question, namely, the
                                appointment in the near future of an American High Commissioner for
                                Germany. Immediately upon occupation many important problems will
                                have to be decided on a tripartite basis. The European Advisory
                                Commission has not been able to consider many of these problems and
                                has concentrated primarily on the organization that would be set up
                                for the control of Germany. Once the first military phase of
                                occupation is completed, it is essential that a tripartite board be
                                established as soon as possible to assume the political and economic
                                responsibility for the control of Germany and to advise the military
                                commanders how the objectives of occupation can best be obtained.
                                The High Commissioner should be a person of great political ability
                                and prestige who would be able to work out with both the British and
                                Russians a common policy and who would be capable of directing the
                                control organization to be established in Germany. This appointment
                                should preferably be made as soon as possible in order that he may
                                meet with officials both here and in London who have been working on
                                these problems.</p>

                                submitted to the Committee by the Secretary of State and have
                                discussed it with my colleagues on the Committee.</p>
                            <p>With the exception of the last paragraph I find myself in agreement
                                with the principles stated therein and the are in conformity with

                                in our directives to the Armed Forces.</p>
                            <p>The last paragraph, however, is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        population shall be held down to subsistence levels; (2)
                                        German economic position of power in Europe must be

                                        in such manner that it will be so dependent upon imports and
                                        exports that Germany cannot by its own devices reconvert to
                                        war production”.</p>

                            <p>While certain of these statements by themselves may possibly be
                                susceptible of a construction with which I would not be at variance,
                                the construction put upon them at the discussion this morning
                                certainly reached positions to which I am utterly opposed. The
                                position frankly taken by some of my colleagues was that the great
                                industrial regions of Germany known as the Saar and the Ruhr with
                                their very important deposits of coal and ore should be totally
                                transformed into a non-industrialized area of agricultural
                                    land.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">Morgenthau wrote to Stimson on

                            <p>I cannot conceive of such a proposition being either possible or
                                effective and I can see enormous general evils coming from an
                                attempt to so treat it. During the past eighty years of European
                                history this portion of Germany was one of the most important
                                sources of the raw materials upon which the industrial and economic
                                livelihood of Europe was based. Upon the production which came from
                                the raw materials of this region during those years, the commerce of
                                Europe was very largely predicated. Upon that production Germany
                                became the largest source of supply to no less than ten European
                                countries, viz: Russia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland,
                                Switzerland, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria; and the
                                second largest source of supply to Great Britain, Belgium, and
                                France. By the same commerce, which in large part arose from this
                                production, Germany also became the best buyer or customer of
                                Russia, Norway, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and
                                Austria–Hungary; and the second best customer of Great Britain,
                                Sweden, and Denmark. The production of these materials from this
                                region could not be sealed up and obliterated as was proposed this
                                morning, without manifestly causing a great dislocation to the trade
                                upon which Europe has lived. In Germany itself this commerce has
                                built up since 1870 a population of approximately thirty million
                                more people than were ever supported upon the agricultural soil of
                                Germany alone. Undoubtedly a similar growth of population took place
                                in the nations which indirectly participated in the commerce based
                                upon this production.</p>
                            <p>I cannot treat as realistic the suggestion that such an area in the
                                present economic condition of the world can be turned into a
                                nonproductive “ghost territory” when it has become the center of one
                                of the most industrialized continents in the world, populated by
                                peoples of energy, vigor and progressiveness.</p>
                            <p>I can conceive of endeavoring to meet the misuse which Germany has
                                recently made of this production by wise systems of control or <pb
                                    n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0156"/>trusteeship or even
                                transfers of ownership to other nations. But I can not conceive of
                                turning such a gift of nature into a dust heap.</p>
                            <p>War is destruction. This war more than any previous war has caused
                                gigantic destruction. The need for the recuperative benefits of
                                productivity is more evident now than ever before throughout the
                                world. Not to speak of Germany at all or even her satellites, our
                                Allies in Europe will feel the need of the benefit of such
                                productivity if it should be destroyed. Moreover, speed of
                                reconstruction is of great importance, if we hope to avoid dangerous
                                convulsions in Europe.</p>
                            <p>We contemplate the transfer from Germany of ownership of East
                                Prussia, Upper Silesia, Alsace and Lorraine (each of them except the
                                first containing raw materials of importance) together with the
                                imposition of general economic controls. We also are considering the
                                wisdom of a possible partition of Germany into north and south
                                sections, as well as the creation of an internationalized State in
                                the Ruhr. With such precautions, or indeed with only some of them,
                                it certainly should not be necessary for us to obliterate all
                                industrial productivity in the Ruhr area, in order to preclude its
                                future misuse.</p>
                            <p>Nor can I agree that it should be one of our purposes to hold the
                                German population “to a subsistence level” if this means the edge of
                                poverty. This would mean condemning the German people to a condition
                                of servitude in which, no matter how hard or how effectively a man
                                worked, he could not materially increase his economic condition in
                                the world. Such a program would, I believe, create tensions and
                                resentments far outweighing any immediate advantage of security and
                                would tend to obscure the guilt of the Nazis and the viciousness of
                                their doctrines and their acts.</p>
                            <p>By such economic mistakes I cannot but feel that you would also be
                                poisoning the springs out of which we hope that the future peace of
                                the world can be maintained.</p>
                            <p>It is primarily by the thorough apprehension, investigation, and
                                trial of all the Nazi leaders and instruments of the Nazi system of
                                terrorism, such as the <gloss target="#t_Gestapo1">Gestapo</gloss>,
                                with punishment delivered as promptly, swiftly, and severely as
                                possible, that we can demonstrate the abhorrence which the world has
                                for such a system and bring home to the German people our
                                determination to extirpate it and all its fruits forever.</p>
                            <p>My basic objection to the proposed methods of treating Germany which
                                were discussed this morning was that in addition to a system of
                                preventive and educative punishment they would add the dangerous
                                weapon of complete economic oppression. Such methods, in my opinion,
                                do not prevent war; they tend to breed war.</p>

                                    (not printed), suggested the preparation of an American-British
                                    directive to Eisenhower on the military government of Germany
                                    after Germany’s surrender. This suggestion was referred to the

                                    Department prepared a draft of such a directive. The draft
                                    printed below is not known to have been referred to at the
                                    Second Quebec Conference, but it formed part of the background
                                    of the discussion of German problems within the Cabinet
                                    Committee on Germany and between the Committee and Roosevelt.
                                    Following the Quebec Conference an amended version of this draft
                                    (dated September 22, 1944) was submitted to the Joint Chiefs of

                                now be able to add, of course, a provision regarding regional
                                movements. The directive would provide that they should not be
                                discouraged. We are generally working on improving the language and
                                in some cases the order of the document, but in general this is the
                                idea. I think that if the Committee could approve it generally,
                                without going through it with a fine tooth comb, it would leave us
                                room in the [Combined] Civil Affairs Committee to work out the final
                                language and the clearance with the British.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Stimson was very much disturbed this morning at the line
                                that was taken throughout the discussion on the matter of economic
                                repression of Germany. He felt that the last paragraph of the paper,
                                I believe it was sub-paragraph (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>),<note

                                in some form, could be interpreted in a way which would meet his
                                views, but the tone of the discussion convinced him that its
                                interpretation by those present amounted to such severe destruction
                                of values in the case of properties and facilities and such severe
                                limitation on the economy of the individual, that he felt he could
                                not go along with the implications of this paragraph and has so
                                communicated to Mr. Hull.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">See Stimson’s

                            <p>I was not present at the discussion, so I do not know what happened.
                                I don’t believe that the Secretary, from my long talk with him
                                yesterday, however, is at all at variance with your and my thinking
                                on the subject. I hope you will take a look at Mr. Stimson’s
                                comments.</p>
                            <p>I have one other comment which I did not ask him to include because
                                it was relatively minor. Somewhere in your paper there is a
                                statement to the effect that Party members should not be permitted
                                any political or civic activity. I think this must refer only to the
                                leaders, because Party members who were only such in order to keep
                                jobs will have to be permitted to carry on some civic activity, and
                                possibly political activity if by political activity you mean
                                employment in a government field. The provision as written would
                                preclude any Party member from voting, practising law, or taking any
                                part at all in any municipal or other governmental activity. I just
                                do not believe that this is practicable and some modification of
                                this language may be necessary in order to enable the military
                                government to function.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>

                                            in Washington. Morgenthau called Roosevelt’s attention
                                            to the <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> and in a
                                            memorandum for the President dated August 25, 1944,
                                            quoted extracts which he considered particularly
                                            objectionable. Using the Morgenthau memorandum as a
                                            basis, Roosevelt instructed Stimson on August 26 to
                                            withdraw the <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi>.

                                                  in Germany should realize that this time Germany
                                                  is a defeated nation. I do not want them to starve
                                                  to death but, as an example, if they need food to
                                                  keep body and soul together beyond what they have,
                                                  they should be fed three times a day with soup
                                                  from Army soup kitchens. That will keep them
                                                  perfectly healthy and they will remember the
                                                  experience all their lives. The fact that they are
                                                  a defeated nation, collectively and individually,
                                                  must be so impressed upon them that they will

                                    instructions relative to a possible partition of Germany.
                                    Shortly after the European Advisory Commission was established,
                                    a Sub-committee on Partition was set up but no reports have ever
                                    been received and apparently no discussion on this question has
                                    taken place in London.</p>
                                <p>It is the view of the Department of State that this Government
                                    should oppose a forcible partition of Germany. An imposed
                                    dismemberment of Germany into two or more separate states has
                                    been advocated as a practicable means of forestalling any
                                    renewal of German aggression. However, such a measure would not
                                    remove the necessity of imposing and enforcing far-reaching
                                    security control upon Germany for an undetermined period whether
                                    Germany is left united or is partitioned.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, because of the high degree of economic, political
                                    and cultural integration in Germany which has developed over the
                                    past 75 years, it must be anticipated that partition would not
                                    only have to be imposed, but also maintained by force. The
                                        <gloss target="#t_Victor1">victor</gloss> powers, by
                                    imposing partition, would assume a burdensome and continuing
                                    task of preventing surreptitious collaboration between the
                                    partite states and of restraining a nationalistic determination
                                    to reunite, which would probably be the response of the German
                                    people. Finally, the disruption of German economic unity might
                                    menace the economic stability of Europe as a whole.</p>
                                <p>In place of partition, the Department of State would favor a
                                    return to a federal system of government in Germany, including
                                    the division of Prussia into a number of medium-sized states. In
                                    reaction to Nazi over-centralization, the Germans might return
                                    to a considerable degree of federal decentralization, including
                                    the breakup of Prussia which in 1938 included 62% of the area
                                    and two-thirds of the population of Germany.</p>

                                    while desiring to avoid the appearance of competing with the
                                    United States, the British apparently desire to assume the same

                                        Marcel Vigneras, <hi rend="italic">Rearming the French</hi>

                                    very difficult for the British to accept the added burden. The
                                    British conclude that if this Government is unwilling to accept
                                    the proposed commitment they will have to reconsider the
                                    situation.</p>
                                <p>Presumably the technical aspects of the question are being
                                    studied by the Combined Chiefs of Staff to whom supporting
                                    figures have been furnished by the British. The financial
                                    ramifications will also require careful study.</p>
                                <p>Our present policy toward France is based on the belief that it
                                    is in the best interests of the United States that France resume
                                    her traditional position as a principal power, capable of
                                    playing a part in the occupation of Germany and in maintaining
                                    peace in Europe. The recruiting and equipping of French land
                                    forces would be a natural corollary of that policy, leaving for
                                    decision the question of the source from which the arms should
                                    be obtained and the quantity which should be provided.</p>
                                <p>It would seem advantageous to this country to have the rearming
                                    carried out from American sources. Politically it could be
                                    portrayed as a further evidence of American friendship for
                                    France and a proof of our desire to see France restored to a
                                    strong position. American influence and prestige would be
                                    enhanced. Furthermore French reliance on the United States for
                                    arms would provide us with a lever which might enable us to
                                    exercise a certain measure of influence on French policy for a
                                    number of years. Conversely it is certain that, in their present
                                    highly nationalistic and aggressive frame of mind, the French
                                    will make every effort to obtain arms from one source or
                                    another. If they obtain them from a source other than the United
                                        <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0179"/>States, they may be
                                    compelled to accept conditions of a political or other nature
                                    which run counter to American aims.</p>
                                <p>In making the above recommendation I have not failed to give
                                    careful consideration to the fact that British policy aims at
                                    forming, and playing the leading role in, a group of Western
                                    European countries, including France, and that one of the
                                    objects of the British Government in suggesting the rearming of
                                    France by the United States is thereby to create a link between
                                    this country and the Western European nations which might be
                                    useful to them in the future. This I believe is the primary and
                                    all important reason behind the British request and it may, of
                                    course, have important long-range strategic implications.</p>

                                <p>Our discussions relate to a matter of method entirely; our
                                    objective is the same. It is not a question of a soft treatment
                                    of Germany or a harsh treatment of Germany. We are all trying to
                                    devise protection against recurrence by Germany of her attempts
                                    to dominate the world. We differ as to method. The fundamental
                                    remedy of Mr. Morgenthau is to provide that the industry of
                                    Germany shall be substantially obliterated. Although expressed
                                    only in terms of the Ruhr, the fact <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124"
                                        facs="0180"/>of the matter is that the Ruhr and the adjacent
                                    territories which Mr. Morgenthau would include in his program
                                    constitute, particularly after the amputations that are
                                    proposed, the core of German industry. His proposition is <quote

                                <p>I am unalterably opposed to such a program for the reasons given
                                    in my memorandum dated September 5<note n="5" xml:id="d90fn5"

                                            98</ref>.</note> which is already before the President.
                                    I do not think that the reasons there stated need again be
                                    elaborated. In substance, my point is that these resources
                                    constitute a natural and necessary asset for the productivity of
                                    Europe. In a period when the world is suffering from destruction
                                    and from want of production, the concept of the total
                                    obliteration of these values is to my mind wholly wrong. My
                                    insistence is that these assets be conserved and made available
                                    for the benefit of the whole of Europe, including particularly
                                    Great Britain. The internationalization of the Ruhr or the
                                    trusteeship of its products—I am not prepared at the moment to
                                    discuss details of method—constitutes a treatment of the problem
                                    in accord with the needs and interests of the world. To argue
                                    that we are incapable of sustained effort to control such wealth
                                    within proper channels is to destroy any hope for the future of
                                    the world. I believe that the education furnished us by the
                                    Germans in two world wars, plus the continuity of interest which
                                    such a trusteeship would stimulate is sufficient insurance that
                                    we can be trusted to deal with the problem. The unnatural
                                    destruction of this industry would, on the other hand, be so
                                    certain, in my judgment, to provoke sympathy for the Germans
                                    that we would create friends both in this country and abroad for
                                    the Germans, whereas now most of the peoples of the world are
                                    thoroughly antipathetic to them.</p>
                                <p>The other fundamental point upon which I feel we differ is the
                                    matter of the trial and punishment of those Germans who are
                                    responsible for crimes and depredations. Under the plan proposed
                                    by Mr. Morgenthau, the so-called arch-criminals shall be put to
                                    death by the <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0181"/>military
                                    without provision for any trial and upon mere identification
                                    after apprehension. The method of dealing with these and other
                                    criminals requires careful thought and a well-defined procedure.
                                    Such procedure must embody, in my judgment, at least the
                                    rudimentary aspects of the Bill of Eights, namely, notification
                                    to the accused of the charge, the right to be heard and, within
                                    reasonable limits, to call witnesses in his defense. I do not
                                    mean to favor the institution of state trials or to introduce
                                    any cumbersome machinery but the very punishment of these men in
                                    a dignified manner consistent with the advance of civilization,
                                    will have all the greater effect upon posterity. Furthermore, it
                                    will afford the most effective way of making a record of the
                                    Nazi system of terrorism and of the effort of the Allies to
                                    terminate the system and prevent its recurrence.</p>
                                <p>I am disposed to believe that at least as to the chief Nazi
                                    officials, we should participate in an international tribunal
                                    constituted to try them. They should be charged with offences
                                    against the laws of the Rules of War in that they have committed
                                    wanton and unnecessary cruelties in connection with the
                                    prosecution of the war. This law of the Rules of War has been
                                    upheld by our own Supreme Court and will be the basis of
                                    judicial action against the Nazis.</p>
                                <p>Even though these offences have not been committed against our
                                    troops, I feel that our moral position is better if we take our
                                    share in their conviction. Other war criminals who have
                                    committed crimes in subjugated territory should be returned in
                                    accordance with the Moscow Declaration<note n="6"

                                    military commissions having jurisdiction of the offence under
                                    the same Rules of War. I have great difficulty in finding any
                                    means whereby military com missions may try and convict those
                                    responsible for excesses committed within Germany both before
                                    and during the war which have no relation to the conduct of the
                                    war. I would be prepared to construe broadly what constituted a
                                    violation of the Rules of War but there is a certain field in
                                    which I fear that external courts cannot move. Such courts would
                                    be without jurisdiction in precisely the same way that any
                                    foreign court would be without jurisdiction to try those who
                                    were guilty of, or condoned, lynching in our own country.</p>
                                <p>The above are the two main points with which I differ from the
                                    proposed program submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
                                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Partition</hi></p>
                                <p>I have an open mind on partition and although I have given the
                                    matter substantial consideration I have, as yet, come to no
                                    conclusion <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0182"/>as to wisdom
                                    or method of partition. I feel we cannot deal effectively with
                                    that subject until we have had an interchange of views with the
                                    English and the Russians. I, myself, seek further light on this
                                    subject. I, certainly, would not discourage any spontaneous
                                    effort toward separation of the country into two or more
                                    groups.</p>
                                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Amputation</hi></p>
                                <p>I understand that there is some general recognition of the
                                    probability of Russia or the <gloss target="#t_Poles1"
                                        >Poles</gloss> taking East Prussia and some parts of
                                    Silesia. I suggest that we interpose no objection to this but
                                    that we take no part in the administration of the area. On the
                                    Western border the primary question is the matter of dealing
                                    with the Ruhr but it has also been suggested that the Rhineland
                                    and the Saar be delivered to France. Naturally I am in favor of
                                    the automatic return of Alsace and Lorraine to France but though
                                    my mind is not irrevocably closed against it, I feel that the
                                    burden of proof lies on those who suggest giving France more
                                    territory. She will come out of this war with her Empire
                                    practically intact, with a reduced population and already
                                    possessing a very valuable bit of ore in the Longwy-Briey area.
                                    To give her a substantial territory of German-speaking and
                                    German-bred people would create another problem in the balance
                                    of Europe. To counteract this, I would give France a share in
                                    the benefits of the internationalization of the Saar and the
                                    Ruhr and the advantage which this gives of what would in effect
                                    be an international barrier between France and Germany.</p>
                                <p>There are certain other methods of punishment affecting the
                                    personal lives of individual Germans proposed by the Secretary
                                    of the Treasury to which I am opposed as constituting
                                    irritations of no fundamental value and, indeed, of considerable
                                    danger, but these are primarily matters of administration which
                                    I think need not be discussed at this time. In some part, at
                                    least, they had best be determined by those who have the primary
                                    responsibility for the administration of the occupation.</p>
                                <p>As a suggestion, I propose that during the interim period, which
                                    is all that we can deal with at the moment, the President be
                                    recommended to approve a program generally in accord with the
                                    memorandum submitted by the Secretary of State at the meeting of
                                    the Cabinet Committee on Tuesday, September 5, except for a

                                <p>If we were to expect Germany to pay recurring reparations,
                                    whether in the form of money or goods, we would be forced at the
                                    very beginning to start a rehabilitation and reconstruction
                                    program for the German economy. For instance, we would have to
                                    supply her with transportation equipment, public utility
                                    repairs, food for her working population, machinery for heavy
                                    industry damaged by bombing, re construction of housing and
                                    industrial raw materials. No matter how the program would be
                                    dressed up, we would, in effect be doing for Germany what we
                                    expect to do for the liberated areas of Europe but perhaps on an
                                    even greater scale, because of Germany’s more advanced
                                    industrialization.</p>
                                <p>When reparation deliveries cease Germany will be left with a more

                                            would continue to be dependent on Germany as a source of

                                        Strong Industrial Germany</hi></head>
                                <p>1. The assumption sometimes made that Germany is an indispensable
                                    source of industrial supplies for the rest of Europe is not
                                    valid.</p>
                                <p>U.S., U.K. and the French-Luxembourg-Belgian industrial group
                                    could easily have supplied out of unused industrial capacity
                                    practically all that Germany supplied to Europe during the
                                    pre-war period. In the post-war period the expanded industrial
                                    capacity of the United Nations, particularly the U.S., can
                                    easily provide the reconstruction and industrial needs of Europe
                                    without German assistance.</p>
                                <p>Total German exports to the entire world in 1938 were only about
                                    $2 billion, of which machinery steel and steel products amounted
                                    to about $750 million, coal $165 million and chemicals $230
                                    million.</p>
                                <p>These amounts are trivial in comparison with the increased
                                    industrial potential of the U.S. alone, or of the U.K. One-fifth
                                    of our lend-lease exports of 1943 would be sufficient to replace
                                    the full exports of Germany to the whole world.</p>
                                <p>2. A claim has been made that Europe is dependent upon Ruhr coal.
                                    The French-Belgian steel industry and some of the new industrial
                                    units which will arise in Europe after the war will need
                                    imported coal <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0190"/>supplies.
                                    However, the British coal industry which suffered from German
                                    competition before the war will be able to supply a major part
                                    if not all of these needs. The coal industries of France,
                                    Poland, Silesia and the Saar are also capable of further
                                    expansion if the competition of the Ruhr is eliminated. Further
                                    supplies if necessary could be obtained from the United States
                                    though at a much higher price. The different quality of the
                                    substitute coals may require some technological changes but the
                                    adjustment can be made.</p>
                                <p>Germany had a net export of coal of 32 million tons in 1937. The
                                    difference between the British coal production in a good year
                                    and a depressed year was more than the total German exports of
                                    coal. Moreover, at no time in the last 25 years has the British
                                    coal industry worked at full capacity.</p>
                                <p>3. Germany has been important to the rest of Europe as a market
                                    principally for surplus agricultural products. In 1937 Germany’s
                                    food imports from the world were $800 million, of which Europe
                                    supplied $450 million. Total German purchases of raw materials
                                    from Europe in 1937 were about $350 million. The loss of the
                                    German market will be largely compensated for by the following

                                <p>The U.K. exported principally coal and textile materials to
                                    Germany and the principal French exports were iron ore and wool.
                                    The elimination of German industrial exports will provide
                                    adequate markets for these exports and more.</p>
                                <p>The loss of the German market may be important to the Balkan
                                    countries. Agricultural exports of these countries to Germany
                                    were abnormally large in 1938 because of Germany’s unscrupulous
                                    exploitation through clearing agreements and other devices.
                                    These countries will find markets for part of their food surplus
                                    through industrialization and a higher standard of living within
                                    their own country. German areas will continue to import some
                                    food from them. However, there may be a net loss of markets to
                                    Denmark, Holland, and Yugoslavia, and these countries will need
                                    to make an adjustment in their economies which should not be
                                    difficult in the period of greater adjustments which will come
                                    with liberation.</p>
                                <p>5. In short, the statement that a healthy European economy is de
                                    pendent upon German industry was never true, nor will it be true
                                    in the future. Therefore the treatment to be accorded to Germany
                                    should be decided upon without reference to the economic
                                    consequences upon the rest of Europe. At the worst, these
                                    economic consequences will involve relatively minor economic
                                    disadvantages in certain sections of Europe. At best, they will
                                    speed up the industrial development of Europe outside of
                                    Germany. But any disadvantages will be more than offset by real
                                    gains to the political objectives and the economic interests of
                                    the United Nations as a whole.</p>

                                        Locked Up and the Equipment Removed</hi></head>
                                <p>During the last hundred years the basis of modern German
                                    militarism has been the industrial capacity of the Ruhr. Very
                                    large resources of high quality coal that lends itself
                                    particularly well to the production of coke and a fortunate
                                    geographic location which facilitated the importation of iron
                                    ore, were the foundation of an industrial apparatus that is
                                    unique throughout the world and the development of which has
                                    been deliberately guided by military objectives.</p>
                                <p>The elimination of this industrial apparatus is indispensable to
                                    rendering renewed German aggression impossible for many years to
                                    come. No other device could serve this main objective of the
                                    United Nations with the same effectiveness. Dismemberment of
                                    Germany alone would not suffice since political developments
                                    several decades hence may make a reunion of the several German
                                    states possible. In that case the reunited German State would
                                    immediately possess a huge industrial potential unless the Ruhr
                                    industry were destroyed.</p>
                                <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0192"/>
                                <p>If the Ruhr industry were eliminated, new iron and steel
                                    industries would unquestionably be built up in the rest of
                                    Europe to provide for those needs in iron and steel which the
                                    Ruhr used to satisfy, and to make use of the French iron ore
                                    production. Coal would become available from the Saar, from
                                    increased production in France, Great Britain, Silesia and
                                    Poland. The elimination of the Ruhr would hence be a welcome
                                    contribution to the prosperty of the coal industry of several
                                    United Nations. Great Britain has very large reserves of coal;
                                    her proved reserves are held to represent, at the present rate
                                    of extraction, about 500 years’ supply.</p>
                                <p>Britain’s coal production has severely declined in the inter-war
                                    period and never again reached its maximum of 1913 (293 million
                                    metric tons). The level of production in the years preceding
                                    this was that of the turn of the century, the increase between
                                    1900 and 1913 having been lost. The production in 1938 was 60
                                    million tons lower than in 1913.</p>
                                <p>The new iron and steel industries which will arise in Europe to
                                    take the place of the Ruhr will have such a powerful vested
                                    interest that they will constitute a permanent and effective
                                    barrier to the reindustrialization of the Ruhr.</p>

                                <p>The economic rehabilitation of Germany is the problem of the
                                    German people and not of the Allied Military authorities. The
                                    German people must bear the consequences of their own acts.</p>
                                <p>The sole purpose of the military in control of the German economy
                                    should be to facilitate military operations and military
                                    occupation. The Allied Military Government should not assume
                                    responsibility for such economic problems as price controls,
                                    rationing, unemployment, production, reconstruction,
                                    distribution, consumption, housing, or transportation, or take
                                    any measures designed to maintain or strengthen the German
                                    economy. The responsibility for sustaining the German economy
                                    and people rests with the German people with such facilities as
                                    may be available under the circumstances.</p>
                                <p>No relief supplies should be imported, or distributed from German
                                    stocks, beyond the minimum necessary to prevent disease and such
                                    disorder as might endanger or impede military operations or
                                    occupation. The Allied Military authorities should have no
                                    responsibility for the provision and distribution or [<hi

                                    supplies. German import requirements should be strictly limited
                                    to minimum quotas of critical items and should not in any
                                    instance take precedence over the supply requirements of
                                    liberated territories.</p>
                                <p>Agricultural supplies in Germany should be utilized for the
                                    German population, provided, however, that German consumption
                                    shall be <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0194"/>held to a
                                    minimum so as to maximize the surplus of agricultural products
                                    available for liberated countries.</p>
                                <p>Allied Military authorities should not be concerned with
                                    restoring any physical destruction caused during hostilities,
                                    except as absolutely essential to the health of the population.
                                    The Germans will have that responsibility, to do the job as best
                                    they can.</p>

                                    Education</hi></head>
                                <p>The militaristic spirit which pervades the German people has been
                                    deliberately fostered by all educational institutions in Germany
                                    for many decades. Schools, Colleges and Universities were used
                                    with great effectiveness to instill into the children and the
                                    youth of the nation the seeds of aggressive nationalism and the
                                    desire for world domination. Re-education of the German people
                                    must hence be part of the program to render Germany ineffective
                                    as an aggressive power.</p>
                                <p>Re-education cannot be effectively undertaken from outside the
                                    country and by teachers from abroad. It must be done by the
                                    Germans <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0195"/>themselves. The
                                    hard facts of defeat and of the need for political, economic and
                                    social reorientation must be the teachers of the German people.
                                    The existing educational system which is utterly nazified must
                                    be completely reorganized and reformed. The chief task will be
                                    to locate politically reliable teachers and to educate, as soon
                                    as possible, new teachers who are animated by a new spirit.</p>
                                <p>A United Nations Commission of Education should be created which
                                    will have supreme authority in all matters of education and
                                    organs of public opinion. All educational institutions of any
                                    type and character will be closed. Their reopening will depend
                                    (1) upon the possibility of assembling faculties in whom
                                    political confidence can be placed; (2) upon reorganization of
                                    curricula; (3) upon the completion of new text books to replace
                                    the utterly unusable books of the past. During a preliminary
                                    period only[,] appointments to faculties of educational
                                    institution[s] should be subject to the approval of the United
                                    Nations Commission of Education. While it may be possible to
                                    reassemble faculties for primary schools after a relatively
                                    short time, all institutions of higher learning, the chief
                                    centers of militaristic, pan-German propaganda in the past, may
                                    have to remain closed for a number of years.</p>

                                    President Roosevelt</hi></p>
                            <p>The President began with an account of his boyhood studies in Germany
                                when, he said, he grew fond of the German people as they were in the
                                1890’s—their music and love of liberty, and the absence of
                                militarism. No one at that time wore a uniform. Even the railroad
                                station masters would wear civilian clothes, with only a uniform
                                cap. The President said that four years later he visited Germany
                                again and found a great change in this respect—the students had
                                started wearing uniforms and were marching in formation. Militarism
                                took the ascendency from then on.</p>
                            <p>The President stated his belief that all of this must be eradicated
                                and a new process of demilitarized education begun. This might well
                                take forty years to accomplish.</p>
                            <p>The President mentioned the report that the Germans were flooding
                                parts of Holland. He said that where sea water is allowed to flood
                                land it ruins it for agricultural purposes for as much as
                                twenty-five years. Therefore, if Holland suffered this loss, it
                                would seem to be fair that Holland receive certain compensation from
                                German territory. In that connection he spoke of an international
                                zone or trustee ship which would be created embracing the territory,
                                roughly, from the Kiel Canal down to about Hanover, including the
                                Ruhr and a strip of territory west of the Rhine, but not including
                                the city of Cologne, down to and including the Saar. The President
                                was noncommital as to whether the trustees under such an arrangement
                                should include more than the three great powers, France for example.
                                He did indicate that he considered that France would emerge from
                                this war in a strong position, relatively stronger, he said, than
                                Great Britain, with the French Empire probably intact.</p>
                            <p>The President said that the United States was not interested in
                                reparations from Germany, but that he realized that other countries
                                were, and was in accord that the Soviet Union, Great Britain and <pb
                                    n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0201"/>others should benefit by
                                the use of German labor and equipment. He expressed the opinion that
                                the British Empire was bankrupt and that we could not afford to see
                                it disintegrate. He was willing to see Great Britain, as he was the
                                Soviet Union, profit by German assets.</p>
                            <p>The President also expressed the view that it might be better for the
                                Allies in concluding hostilities with the Germans to deal only with
                                local commanders and authorities, rather than with a central
                                authority and the German high command. This, he indicated, would
                                protect us from the charge of having made a deal with anybody or to
                                have become affiliated with a group which, while pretending to be
                                anti-Nazi, might be a cover for unwelcome elements.</p>
                            <p>War criminals, the President hoped might be dealt with summarily. His
                                principal preoccupation was that they be properly identified before
                                being disposed of, but he expressed himself as very much opposed to
                                long, drawn-out legal procedure.</p>
                            <p>The President also discussed French and Italian affairs, and I

                                by the fact that at that time (August 1943) no consideration had

                                not involve large areas. Belgium and Luxembourg were transferred
                                from the American to the British zone and Austria was added as an
                                American responsibility whereas it had not been included in the
                                original <gloss target="#t_COSSAC1">COSSAC</gloss> plan. France,
                                with the largest population and area of the “liberated countries”,
                                remained American. The significance of the new <gloss
                                    target="#t_COSSAC1">COSSAC</gloss> proposal was that it focused
                                American attention on <gloss target="#t_Rankin1"><hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">Rankin</hi></gloss> as it had not been
                                before. The allocation of spheres had been tentatively set down as
                                “strategic recommendations” in August but now the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff learned that full-scale planning and preparations were
                                proceeding in London along British lines.</p>

                            <p>General Morgan’s recommendations were reviewed by the U.S. Joint
                                Staff Planners who reported that action on them by the Joint Chiefs
                                should be deferred pending information on our post-war political and
                                economic policies. It was at once apparent to the Planners that
                                    <gloss target="#t_COSSAC1">COSSAC</gloss>’s plan reflected deep
                                and careful study; he had coordinated his efforts with the Foreign
                                Office and the War Cabinet; and his plan reflected British political
                                and economic as well as military policy. Similar guidance and
                                direction was needed, they felt, by the U.S. Chiefs before
                                commitments on the <gloss target="#t_COSSAC1">COSSAC</gloss> plan
                                were made.<note n="**" xml:id="d94fn11"><gloss target="#t_JCS1"

                                on 17 November, en route Cairo, the Chiefs prepared a paper for the

                            <p>On the same day, the Joint Chiefs addressed a letter to the
                                President. Explaining the new <gloss target="#t_COSSAC1"
                                    >COSSAC</gloss> proposals which divided Europe into three
                                spheres of responsibility, the Chiefs stated that exact boundaries
                                between U.S., British and Soviet zones could not be defined until
                                agreement on the subject had been reached by the three governments.
                                Due to a rapidly developing military situation it was necessary to
                                come to this agreement as soon as possible but before it could be
                                done, they needed guidance so that an occupation plan would be in
                                accord with American political and economic policies and with
                                international agreements.<note n="‡‡" xml:id="d94fn13"><gloss

                                for advice and for information on U.S. policy. He informed Admiral
                                Leahy that he could not agree to the areas of occupation which
                                General Morgan had proposed and that he wished American forces to
                                occupy northern Europe, that is, Scandinavia, Denmark, and northern
                                Germany and not the area which <gloss target="#t_COSSAC1"

                                American forces to occupy, and stated that the British should be
                                responsible for France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and southern Germany
                                and that the U.S.S.R. should occupy eastern Germany.</p>

                                and he again emphasized that we should get U.S. troops into Berlin

                            <p>After the President had expressed his views to the Chiefs, it was
                                possible for planning groups to initiate definite studies. The Joint
                                Staff Planners examined the feasibility of American occupation of
                                the northern area proposed by the President and concluded that it
                                was more advantageous from a military as well as a political point
                                of view. The people in the northern area are more stable racially
                                and politically, ports and lines of communications are better and
                                less liable to sabotage, and they concluded that we should have to
                                remain there less time. The defeat of Japan is a primary concern,
                                taking priority over restoration and rehabilitation of Europe;
                                supplies and shipping must not be tied up in Europe when they can be
                                used in the Pacific war. Hence the area committing least forces for
                                the shortest time is most desirable for American occupation. The
                                Joint Staff Planners also considered the problem of “cross-over”.
                                Plans for the invasion of France called for American forces on the
                                right or west flank of the Norman coast and British on the east.
                                Should Germany not weaken suddenly or collapse and should we have a
                                prolonged engagement in France, the line of battle would swing to a
                                north-south axis with Americans still on the right and hence
                                southern flank. Thus, if the U.S. should occupy north western
                                Germany after her defeat or collapse as the President proposed, U.S.
                                troops would have to transfer through British forces moving into
                                southern Germany. This would be difficult with railroads, bridges
                                and highways damaged by air bombardment but by careful coordination
                                with the British our Staff Planners considered it feasible.<note

                                to the British proposal on division of occupied territories. Rather

                            <p>Here the matter rested for a month, during which the <gloss

                                the basis of Americans in southern Germany and British in the north.
                                On January 7 the British Chiefs re plied to the American proposal
                                made at Cairo. “The difficulties in implementing it are such,” they
                                stated, “that it should not be proceeded further with.” In a very
                                lengthy report they elaborated the difficulties. If the occupation
                                of Germany were not to occur until the invasion of France was well
                                under way, transport difficulties of a “cross-over” would be
                                insurmountable, as U.S. Army staffs operating in the southern sector
                                would have to occupy later the northern area. <gloss
                                    target="#t_COSSAC1">COSSAC</gloss> also believed that working up
                                intelligence on the whole area from Denmark to the Swiss frontier
                                which would be necessary for each Army Group would be too great a
                                burden for the staffs. The greatest objection which <gloss

                            <p>The U.S. Joint Staff Planners studied this rebuttal of their earlier
                                recommendations and prepared a counter-claim. They informed the
                                Joint Chiefs that they agreed that logistic difficulties of a
                                “cross-over” would be great, but they strongly disagreed that they
                                were insurmountable. As for replanning causing postponement of the
                                invasion, they presented a letter from Lieutenant General Devers,
                                Commanding General of the European Theatre of Operations, which
                                stated changes could be made on the part of U.S. Forces without any
                                prejudice to <gloss target="#t_Overlord1"><hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >Overlord</hi></gloss>. The Civil Affairs Division of the
                                War Department added that the proposed revision would not create
                                additional burdens nor present additional difficulties; it was
                                possible and desirable. The Staff Planners’ paper concluded with the
                                comment that “the most important point is that time is working
                                against us. If the U.S. proposal is to be put into effect, the
                                decision should be announced without delay.”<note n="§"

                            <p>On February 2 the British replied and added new objections to the
                                change which they had not previously presented. Now they spoke about
                                the desirability of British control of German naval bases in the
                                Baltic and their close working relationship with the air forces and
                                navies of Belgium and Norway during the war, and added the usual
                                comments about the difficulties of “cross-over.” Pointedly, they
                                noted that the U.S. had failed to advance reasons for the proposed
                                change but had simply demanded it and denied the difficulties of its
                                    execution.<note n="¶" xml:id="d94fn22"><gloss target="#t_CCS1"

                            <p>There was now a deadlock. The <gloss target="#t_COSSAC1"
                                    >COSSAC</gloss> Staff, becoming General Eisenhower’s staff when
                                he assumed command of the Allied Expeditionary Force in January, had
                                been directed to make plans for an emergency return to the continent
                                in the case of the complete collapse or sudden surrender of Germany.
                                These tentative plans had been approved “in principle” only by the
                                Combined Chiefs at Quebec in August. The deadlock resulted because,
                                without direction and without approval by the Combined Chiefs,
                                General Morgan proceeded to make specific plans for the occupation
                                by British and U.S. forces on the basis of zones proposed by the
                                British War Cabinet and Foreign Office. When the U.S. Chiefs had
                                been informed what the boundaries of these areas were, they
                                ascertained the views of the President and protested, recommending
                                that the zones be changed. The British Chiefs had refused the
                                change. A series of papers had been exchanged without result. Now,
                                on February 4 the Combined Chiefs agreed that they could not reach a
                                decision, that the matter was beyond their cognizance, and that it
                                would have to be referred to the President and the Prime Minister
                                for decision.<note n="**" xml:id="d94fn23"><gloss target="#t_CCS1"

                            <p>The President acted at once. On February 7 he sent a dispatch to the
                                Prime Minister outlining the impasse confronting the Combined
                                Chiefs. A decision by them was necessary, he said, before the
                                invasion. He put the problems squarely to the Prime Minister: “I am
                                absolutely unwilling to police France and possibly Italy and the
                                Balkans as well. After all, France is your baby and will take a lot
                                of nursing in order to bring it to the point of walking alone. It
                                would be very difficult for me to keep in France my military force
                                or management for any length of time.”<note n="††" xml:id="d94fn24"

                            <p>The Prime Minister’s reply on February 23 echoed the old cries of the
                                British Staff. He complained that the U.S. Chiefs had never given
                                reasons for the reallocation of spheres. He ran through the standard
                                objections: “crossing” of lines of communication, British need to
                                control German naval ports on the Baltic, and the relationship
                                between the <gloss target="#t_RAF1">RAF</gloss> and Norwegian and
                                Netherlands air forces. The Prime Minister failed to understand, he
                                said, the President’s aversion to police work in France.
                                Communications through France did not in his estimate involve
                                policing and in any case, the French provisional government would be
                                in effective control. The Prime Minister rejected the President’s
                                appeal. “All our thoughts and energies must be given to making a
                                success of <gloss target="#t_Overlord1"><hi rend="smallcaps"

                                reasons of over-riding importance could justify such a fundamental
                                change of plan as that proposed.<note n="‡‡" xml:id="d94fn25"

                            <p>The Prime Minister’s reaction was immediate. He said that he had not
                                heard of the matter since he had rejected the President’s first
                                approach on February 23 and he had assumed that the subject was
                                settled. This of course was ignoring the President’s letter of
                                February 29 which was the strongest statement of the American case.
                                “A change of policy such as you now propose would have grave
                                consequences” was the Prime Minister’s manner of disapproving the

                            <p>The next round was the President’s. By dispatch on June 2 he repeated
                                his letter of February 29 and remarked that he had been awaiting the
                                Prime Minister’s reply to it. He had expected, he said, as a result
                                of that letter that at least tentative plans would have been made
                                for the occupation of northwestern Germany by American forces. “In
                                view of my clearly stated inability to police the south and
                                southwestern areas … I really think it is necessary that General
                                Eisenhower should [<hi rend="italic">shall</hi>] even now make such
                                plans as are practical to use American forces of occupation in
                                northwestern Europe during the occupation period. … There is ample
                                time for this,” the President continued, “unless Germany suddenly
                                collapses. … Under my plan all of your needs can and will be taken
                                care of in the northwest area, but I hope you will realize that I am
                                in such a position that I cannot go along with the British General

                                the Prime Minister chose to reject the American proposals when first

                            <p>The President outlined American policy with respect to post-war
                                occupation of Europe very thoroughly in his reply to the Department
                                    <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0211"/>of State. At the outset
                                he denounced the British proposal that the United States should
                                occupy southern Germany and France or have any responsibility for
                                Italy and the Balkans. The burden of reconstruction of those areas
                                is “not our natural task at a distance of 3500 miles or more.” The
                                President defined the principal object of the United States as “not
                                to take part in internal problems in southern Europe but … rather to
                                take part in eliminating Germany as a possible and even probable
                                cause of a third world war.” This we could best do from the
                                northwest. British objections to American occupation of this area
                                were dismissed by the President. “Cross-over” of military forces is
                                entirely feasible, the British desire to control naval bases on the
                                Baltic is a question of long-range security, not of first
                                occupation, and there will be, thought the President, ample time to
                                work that out. “Americans by that time will be only too glad to

                                problems for our war with Japan will provide enough problems at a
                                distance of 3500 sea-miles without our becoming involved in land
                                transport to the center of the continent of Europe. The President

                                replied, in response to these instructions, that he was unable to
                                present the Chiefs of Staff proposals to the European Advisory
                                Commission. It was now out-dated by late developments. The area
                                boundaries defined by the United States would cut the Soviet area
                                into half of that already agreed upon by the British and the
                                Soviets. Such a counter-claim without adequate reasons to
                                substantiate it, and these had not been furnished, would only
                                jeopardize relations with the Soviet Union. Furthermore the
                                Ambassador felt that the Joint Chiefs’ proposals were faulty in that
                                the zone lines did not follow German administrative boundaries. Mr.
                                Winant therefore asked for a restatement of the American position
                                which he could present to the Commission and he recommended that we
                                accept the occupation boundaries as agreed upon by the British and
                                the Soviets withholding, of course, approval of the allocation of
                                southern Germany to the United States.<note n="§§" xml:id="d94fn42"

                                discussion between President and the Prime Minister it was still an
                                open question which should be British and which American.</p>
                            <p>The problem became acute in early August. The Soviet member of the
                                European Advisory Commission declared that unless a decision were
                                reached at once on assignment of occupation zones between England
                                and the United States, the Soviets would refuse to continue
                                discussions on surrender terms and machinery for post-war control.
                                In forwarding this information to the President, who was at sea in
                                the Pacific, on August 2, Mr. Stettinius suggested a compromise to
                                end the long drawn-out controversy. The British should agree to
                                occupy France, Italy and the Balkans should that become necessary;
                                the United States and Great Britain should have joint use or control
                                of northwest German ports thus avoiding any American dependence on
                                French routes; and American forces should occupy southwestern
                                Germany. To encourage acceptance of the compromise, Mr. Stettinius
                                pointed out that the northern area would be more difficult than the
                                southern to control (contrary to estimates of the Joint Chiefs) and
                                that whoever accepted responsibility for it would have to remain “in
                                residence” longer. This State Department compromise of course put
                                American occupation forces in the area against which we had been <pb

                                but other provisions were designed to eliminate many of our
                                objections to that area. The Undersecretary of State urged the
                                President to approve because there was danger of a bad situation
                                developing between Great Britain and the United States of which the
                                Russians would be well aware. Secretaries Stimson and Forrestal

                            <p>The President replied the next day. “It is essential,” he said in
                                rejecting the compromise, “that American troops of occupation will
                                have no responsibility in southern Europe and will be withdrawn from

                                use of Hamburg and Bremen in view of 3000 miles of transport. The
                                President awaited, he informed Mr. Stettinius, an agreement from the
                                Prime Minister that we would police only Northwestern Germany and he
                                could see no reason why the Soviets should express concern at this

                            <p>The Soviets did not make good their threat to walk out of the
                                European Advisory Commission discussions, but their ultimatum had
                                served to call attention again to the deadlock on the allocation of
                                zones at a time when Allied armies in France were advancing at so
                                fast a pace that optimists were predicting the end of the war in two
                                months.</p>
                            <p>It was this lightning advance in fact which caused discussion to open
                                upon a “fourth front.” The Combined Chiefs of Staff, the President
                                and the Prime Minister, and the European Advisory Commission had
                                been unable to agree; now the Allied Military Commander in the field
                                raised the question. General Eisenhower reported to the Combined
                                Chiefs of Staff on August 17 that he might be faced with the
                                occupation of Germany sooner than had been expected. The only
                                possible planning which he could attempt was on a “purely military
                                basis,” the rapid follow-up of his armies by direct pressure on the
                                enemy. His armies, as deployed in France, were placed with the
                                British on the left or northern flank and the Americans on the right
                                or southern flank. Hence Eisenhower found himself, due to the
                                exigencies of war and the absence of basic decision on zones of
                                occupation, making plans for the occupation of southern Germany by
                                his American troops and northwestern Germany by the English.<note

                            <p>On August 23 General Eisenhower elaborated his estimate of the
                                situation. Surrender terms as proposed by the European Advisory
                                Commission and tentative control machinery were apparently based,
                                reported the General, on the expectation that the German Army at
                                some time would surrender en bloc. That now seemed very improbable
                                and he believed it entirely possible that the German Army as a whole
                                would never actually surrender, that Allied forces might enter the
                                country finding no central German authority in control, “with the
                                situation chaotic, probably guerilla fighting and possibly even
                                civil war in certain districts. In these conditions the occupation
                                of Germany will be a continuation of active operations. There can be
                                no question of establishing central tripartite control … until
                                Germany is occupied and order established.”<note n="¶"

                            <p>That is how the question now stands. On the eve of another conference
                                between the President and the Prime Minister, basic decisions on
                                Allied zones of occupation in Europe still have to be made. The
                                Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander made plans in the
                                Fall of 1943 for an emergency return to Europe by British and U.S.
                                forces should Germany weaken or collapse before the invasion of
                                France was launched. Allocation of territory to be occupied by the
                                two nations was on the basis of recommendations of various British
                                agencies. This allocation was not to the liking of the President nor
                                of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, but all efforts by the
                                Chiefs to change it were fruitless, the President’s appeals to the
                                Prime Minister were unanswered, and the European Advisory Commission
                                was deadlocked. <gloss target="#t_COSSAC1">COSSAC</gloss> was
                                superseded by the Supreme Allied Commander in January 1944 but
                                planning along British lines continued as before. As the target date
                                for the invasion drew near, and it was obvious that Germany would
                                not collapse beforehand, the <gloss target="#t_Rankin1"><hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">Rankin</hi></gloss> plan was transformed
                                from occupation of Europe after an “emergency return” to occupation
                                after defeat in the field but areas to be occupied by Great Britain
                                and the United States remained the same. The American reason for
                                demanding a change in the allocation of occupation zones has
                                remained the same throughout nine months of discussion—the political
                                and military desire to be committed as little as possible in Europe
                                after the defeat of Germany in order that our full attention can be
                                devoted to the war with Japan. How effectively we can realize that
                                desire will be determined by the second Quebec Conference.<note

                                    staggering under the burden of this great effort, and with the

                                    almost to the full, daily adding to their foreign debt, their
                                    export trade still languishing, nothing but extreme austerity
                                    and still greater trials for many years to come before them. Yet
                                    that would be almost the case if the theory of the American

                                    can be done unless the President is fully seized of the true

                                Collapse of Germany</p>
                            <p>I told the President that either at our request or on British
                                initiative the British had submitted a list of military
                                    requirements<note n="1" xml:id="d96fn1">Not printed.</note> for
                                a period of one year after the collapse of Germany; that these
                                requirements were obviously made by the British with full
                                consideration of <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0217"/>their
                                internal economy and particularly their export trade. In effect the
                                British are asking us to produce munitions for them at a very high
                                rate while they would turn many of their factories over to consumer
                                production—much of it for export.</p>
                            <p>I told the President that the merits of the British position were
                                being discussed on a low level within our army and navy and that it
                                did not seem to me that this was the proper place to discuss this
                                and, under any circumstances, the British contribution to the final
                                defeat of Japan had not been determined by the Combined Chiefs of
                                Staff, therefore, I could not see how it is possible to even discuss
                                requirements at this time.</p>
                            <p>I told the President that I thought, in effect, the British
                                Government should withdraw their requirements; that we, on our part,
                                should not reduce the production facilities now available to the
                                British; that he and Churchill discuss this matter at Quebec and
                                that a final decision be postponed until the extent of British
                                participation in the war against Japan was determined upon by the
                                Combined Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                            <p>The President agreed with this.</p>
                            <p>I told him I was going to tell the British in the morning.<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d96fn2">See Hopkins’ telegram to Churchill of August 19,
                                    1944, <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_17">p.

                            <p>The President commented further that, in his opinion, it would be
                                very unwise to make formal commitments tying up our industrial
                                machinery, because he felt it quite possible that, with the defeat
                                of Germany, Japan might well cave in. The primary reason would be
                                that Russia might well tell the Japanese that Russia’s hands are now
                                free; that Russia will not tolerate Japanese forces in Manchuria,
                                China or Korea; that, in effect, will be an ultimatum to Japan to
                                withdraw from these countries. The implications of that ultimatum
                                will be such that the President believes that Japan may throw up the
                                sponge immediately. If this should occur, then the whole
                                requirements picture would be immediately changed. All of this is an
                                added reason for not settling the problem of British requirements at
                                the moment.</p>
                            <p>Since talking to the President I have an agreement on this policy
                                with Secy. Morgenthau, Admiral Leahy, Leo Crowley, Dean Acheson, and
                                General Clay who is going to communicate it to Admiral Beeves.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: Your remarks at the
                                Cabinet meeting on Friday, August 18, in regard to our relations
                                with the British Government were of special interest to me. While I
                                realize that these matters are being carefully considered in the
                                State Department and in inter departmental circles, their special
                                significance for agriculture leads me to submit certain points for
                                your consideration and for possible back ground in connection with
                                your forthcoming meeting with Prime Minister Churchill.</p>
                            <p>After the war the United States and a good many other countries will
                                have substantial surpluses of agricultural products for export. Even
                                if it were to prove possible to maintain a high level of employment
                                and purchasing power in the United States and abroad, the world
                                agricultural surplus disposal problem would still be substantial. To
                                protect their farmers against this situation, countries throughout
                                the world are setting up national programs involving price supports
                                and governmental control of foreign trade. It is important, it seems
                                to me, to minimize or forestall clashes between these national
                                programs.</p>
                            <p>At recent international conferences, it has been agreed that the
                                problem of agricultural surpluses is international in scope and
                                should be approached through multilateral rather than unilateral
                                action. This means the negotiation of international arrangements
                                with respect to individual commodities, in which all producing and
                                consuming countries, large and small, having a substantial interest
                                in the commodity would have an opportunity to participate. Such
                                arrangements could make possible an orderly expansion in world trade
                                and consumption. This approach was specifically endorsed by the Hot
                                Springs Conference.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">i.e., the United

                            <p>Under these circumstances we in this Department are much concerned as
                                to the implications of the present British policy of negotiating
                                bilateral purchase contracts which discriminate against United
                                States agriculture in the postwar British market. The British
                                Ministry of Food has contracted with the governments of Canada and

                                Australia are under way and I understand that an inquiry has been
                                made by the British Ministry of Food as to the attitude of this
                                Government toward their making a similar commitment to buy Argentine

                                    <p>On the question of the freezing of Argentine funds
                                        contemplated by your Government, I note that action has now
                                        been taken by the United States Treasury that has the effect
                                        of placing Argentina in the same class as other neutrals
                                        whose funds have been frozen. As the State Department
                                        appreciate, His Majesty’s Government themselves apply
                                        similar restrictions to Argentina as a neutral.</p>
                                    <p>We could clearly not wish to discourage your Government from
                                        discontinuing any inessential purchases from Argentina at
                                        the present juncture. We should, however, hope that, if it
                                        is decided to take such <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165"

                                        the quiet period which we have advocated.</p>
                                    <p>I shall be very surprised if it is found that we ourselves
                                        are making any purchases in Argentina which are not
                                        essential for the prosecution of the war or the maintenance
                                        of the essential economy of this country. I am, however,
                                        consulting the Ministry of Supply on this point and will let

                            <p>10. Consistently with the desire of the Government of the United
                                States to consult fully with the British Government prior to taking
                                new action with relation to Argentina, this Government has resorted
                                to various channels to bring its views with regard to a possible
                                next step fully to the attention of the British Government.</p>
                            <p>On August 9 the Acting Secretary of State met with Sir [<hi
                                    rend="italic">Mr</hi>.] Richard Law, Sir Ronald Campbell, and
                                Mr. Robert Henry Hadow, <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0222"/>and
                                stated that while the Government of the United States fully
                                appreciates the British desire to obtain adequate meat supplies, it
                                trusts that the negotiations with Argentina can be so handled as to
                                reinforce our common political position. The Acting Secretary urged
                                that the negotiations be prolonged and that any contract which may
                                eventually be concluded be for a short term. Mr. Stettinius also
                                emphasized the hope of this Government that the meat purchase may be
                                treated as an isolated commercial transaction dictated by special
                                war needs and, therefore, entirely separate from fundamental
                                political and economic policies. In the same meeting, Mr. Stettinius
                                informed the representatives of the British Government that we are
                                considering a cut in our purchases from Argentina by from 40% to 60%
                                and that serious consideration is being given to the freezing of
                                Argentine funds.</p>
                            <p>On August 2 and again on August 11, Ambassador Winant was instructed
                                to inform the Foreign Secretary of our views both with respect to
                                the meat contract and with respect to possible reduction of
                                purchases and freezing of Argentine funds.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the proposed reduction of purchases, Ambassador
                                Winant was instructed to express our hope that the British
                                Government may be prepared to take parallel action, thus eliminating
                                all purchases of Argentine products not essential for the
                                satisfaction of immediate needs.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Winant has now informed the Department of State that he
                                has received a letter from Mr. Eden dated August 25,<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d101fn3">See <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_164">p. 164</ref>.</note> in which the Foreign
                                Secretary states that the British Government is fully alive to the
                                issue raised by our messages relative to the meat contract. In his
                                letter, Mr. Eden also recognizes the reasons why we propose to
                                discontinue non-essential purchases at the present time and states
                                that he is consulting the Ministry of Supply with respect to
                                possible reduction of British purchases. With respect to the matter
                                of freezing Argentine funds, the Foreign Secretary assumes that the
                                action of our Treasury Department in recently prohibiting the export
                                of two shipments of Argentine gold is tantamount to the freezing of
                                funds and adds that the British Government has already applied
                                “similar restrictions to Argentina as a neutral”.</p>
                            <p>It has been the opinion of this Government that these economic steps
                                constitute a necessary implementation of the nonrecognition policy.
                                In view of Mr. Eden’s recognition of the reasons which have induced
                                that opinion, we are considering taking the indicated action at an
                                early date. However, having in mind the thought expressed by Mr.
                                Eden, we hope so far as possible to avoid undue publicity.</p>
                            <p>Accept [etc.]</p>

                            <p>In connection with the Argentine meat negotiations you have no doubt
                                seen the message to Buenos Aires from the Argentine Ambassador in
                                    London<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">Miguel Angel Cárcano.</note>
                                in which the Ambassador warned his government that its difficulties
                                were “no longer centered on suspension of relations with the United
                                States” and that Argentina was being placed “in a position of
                                isolation vis-à-vis the Allied and friendly nations.” He added that
                                according to a “big meat packer the Allied Nations are now in a
                                position to do without Argentine meat for six months with no trouble
                                at all and for twelve months with some sacrifice.” The Ambassador
                                also said that his information tallies with that from the Argentine
                                Commercial Counsellor in Washington<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3"
                                    >Miguel E. Quirino-Lavalle.</note> and with the view expressed
                                for some time past by the Ambassador himself that the United Nations
                                may make fewer purchases from Argentina.</p>
                            <p>Since we know that the Colonels are falling all over themselves to
                                get you to buy their meat, I am confident that you will agree that
                                the Ambassador’s message was an extremely bad piece of news for
                                them.</p>
                            <p>All the evidence that has come to my attention reinforces our belief
                                that you are in an excellent position to use the negotiations to
                                support the whole Allied stand in this Hemisphere against this broad
                                Fascist movement. You will certainly have no trouble on the beef and
                                mutton matter in any event.</p>

                                points raised in Mr. Wickard’s letter were covered in a preliminary
                                way in these discussions.</p>
                            <p>It was our understanding when the talks terminated last year that
                                conversations would be resumed at an early convenient date. Our
                                latest on this is a telegram from Ambassador Winant dated August
                                    11,<note n="1" xml:id="d104fn4">Not printed.</note> stating that
                                Mr. Ronald of the Foreign Office gave the impression that a date for
                                resumption of conversations might be arranged in the autumn to suit
                                our convenience.</p>
                            <p>Interdepartmental committees including representatives of the
                                Department of Agriculture have been active on this group of
                                problems. Reports of these committees come to me through the
                                Executive Committee on Economic Foreign Policy. In the near future I
                                shall place before you definite recommendations on these matters.
                                Taking everything into consideration, we believe that the
                                conversations should be resumed before the end of October,
                                preferably about the middle of the month. Rather than talking with
                                the Prime Minister on the specific questions suggested by Mr.
                                Wickard, we believe that it would be most desirable if you could
                                gain the wholehearted support of Mr. Churchill for the resumption of
                                conversations about the middle of October on the whole range of
                                subjects covered in a preliminary way last year. In these second
                                conversations with the British the objective would be to obtain
                                agreement not only on principles, but also on the text of a draft
                                multilateral convention to serve as the basis for similar
                                conversations with representatives of other governments, looking
                                toward a conference of the United and Associated Nations.</p>

                                <item>The object of Lend-Lease assistance hitherto has been to
                                    satisfy our justifiable requirements in excess of those which we
                                    can furnish ourselves in conditions of <hi rend="italic"

                                    other words, Lend-Lease has been treated hitherto as <hi

                                        <gloss target="#t_StageII1">Stage II</gloss> the continuance
                                    of Lend-Lease assistance should be compatible with some
                                    appropriate degree of war demobilisation in the United Kingdom
                                    below the 1944 level, the above criterion of Lend-Lease
                                    availability will no longer be applicable. The appropriate
                                    criterion henceforward must necessarily be one of what absolute
                                    amount of assistance is appropriate to the changed conditions.
                                    The President will be asked to recognise this new situation by
                                    agreeing to the preparation of a firm agreement specifying the
                                    amount and character of the assistance on which we can

                                    during the German war from a number of sources. A little under
                                    60 per cent has come from Britain; about 27 per cent has come
                                    from the U.S.A.; about 10 per cent has come from Canada; the
                                    remainder has been drawn from other countries in the British
                                    Empire. If the total of British munitions requirements had to be
                                    provided from British Empire sources, there could be little if

                                    is necessary also to begin to rebuild the damaged cities, to
                                    devote more work to the overdue repairs to industry and public
                                    utilities, and to make first steps towards restoring our export
                                    trade; without exports Britain can neither meet her immediate
                                    obligations nor assure her purchases of necessary imports. These

                                    justice—would be that the proportion of our total munitions
                                    supplies furnished on Lend-Lease should be the same in <gloss

                                    reduced by, say, one third, the amount of munitions furnished on
                                    Lend-Lease should also be reduced in the same proportion of one
                                    third.</item>

                                    this would either fix the total volume of munitions assistance
                                    in <gloss target="#t_StageII1">Stage II</gloss> or would endorse
                                    the principle outlined above. It would then be possible for our
                                    respective officers to work out the detailed programme of supply

                                    shipping, oil, raw materials, etc., which we shall continue to
                                    require would not depend to any great extent on the degree of
                                    our domestic reconversion, since only a small part of such
                                    assistance has been concerned with goods which we are in a
                                    position to produce. Some reduction is, however, possible in so

                                that when you see the Prime Minister you discuss the possibility of

                                may be able to allocate from our supplies. It is believed that with
                                supplies that we can make available, a considerable reduction of

                                purpose. It is understood, however, that they have decided to defer
                                Anderson’s visit for several months. The Prime Minister may possibly

                                assistance to the United Kingdom as may be necessary to reconstitute

                            <p>At the same time it is of fundamental importance to the interests of

                                meeting their admittedly serious balance-of-payments problems, they
                                cannot pursue the liberal, multilateral trade policies we have
                                advocated. That position would not be sound and we should not accept
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Our position should be that whatever the British balance-of-payments
                                problems may be and to whatever extent they may receive our help in
                                meeting them, those problems will in our view be less difficult in a
                                world in which the United States and Britain take the leadership in
                                bringing about the greatest possible expansion of international
                                trade on a multilateral nondiscriminatory basis; that
                                balance-of-payments problems will be more difficult to meet if
                                bilateralistic practices on the German pattern, high tariffs, quotas
                                and discriminations result in a scramble among nations for a
                                diminishing volume of world trade.</p>
                            <p>In brief, in dealing with the British in regard to financial and
                                other economic problems, I believe our basic position should be that
                                the trade policies we advocate are not something the British should
                                do for us in return for our financial help, but that, irrespective
                                of such help, liberal trade policies designed to bring about an
                                expanding world trade are in Britain’s own interest.</p>
                            <p>Obviously, therefore, we should not offer to extend generous credits
                                to Great Britain at a low rate of interest in return for commitments
                                regarding commercial policy and imperial preference (which we
                                already have, in preliminary form, in the Basic Lend-Lease
                                Agreement). The field for bargaining about these matters should be
                                the narrow one of respective tariff concessions. It seems to me,
                                however, that we may properly bear in mind that the United Kingdom
                                will not be a good credit risk unless she embarks on a sound
                                commercial policy.</p>
                            <p>The discussion of trade policies which may take place with the
                                British in the near future will be more fruitful from our
                                standpoint, if there can be complete understanding on the above
                                point before those discussions are undertaken.</p>

                                approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the following reasons:</p>
                            <p>1. In Paragraph 3, <ref target="#pg_18">Page 18</ref>, the report
                                states—“Following the defeat of Germany, Lend-Lease nations outside
                                the Western Hemisphere should be notified of and should accept their
                                obligation to return to the continental United States or to the

                            <p>This action is contrary to a formal agreement between the allied
                                nations, including Great Britain and Russia. Article 5 of the first
                                Master Agreement between Great Britain and ourselves<note n="3"

                                provides that “The Government of the United Kingdom will return to

                                determined by the President, such defense articles, etc.” Similar
                                pro visions are contained in all other Master Agreements. There is
                                no language in these agreements that implies, directly or
                                indirectly, that this action will be taken until the defeat of all
                                our enemies.</p>
                            <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">J.C.S.</gloss> 771/6, in Paragraph 3,
                                further states—“such munitions transferred under Lend-Lease as shall
                                not have been destroyed, lost or consumed and as, in the opinion of
                                the Joint Chiefs of Staff, <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0231"

                                Staff.”</p>
                            <p>This, I believe, is contrary to an agreement between the American and
                                the British Governments and, if not a formal agreement between the
                                two governments, at least an agreement between the President and the
                                Prime Minister. This agreement provides that the entire munition
                                resources of Great Britain and the United States will be deemed to
                                be in a common pool and that a Combined Board will advise on all
                                assignments, both in quantity and priority, whether to Great Britain
                                and the United States or other of the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>3. It seems to me that apart from the above reasons, at this
                                particular stage of the war, such a unilateral action on our part is
                                fraught with probabilities of unnecessary friction which should be,
                                at the least, delayed until after the collapse of Germany. At that
                                time the American policy in relation to this matter should be
                                discussed fully with our allies.</p>

                            <p>7352. I am cabling you below the text of a letter dated September 7
                                which I have just received from Mr. Eden in relation to the renewal
                                of the British meat contract with Argentina: <quote

                                        that I was consulting the Ministry of Food about the renewal
                                        of our meat contract with Argentina in the light of certain
                                        observations of the State Department which you were kind
                                        enough to send me on the 14th August.<note n="2"

                                        position to give you our answer on the general question of
                                        the particular points to which the United States Government
                                        attach importance.</p>
                                    <p>The State Department suggest that, by prolonging the
                                        negotiations and taking a firm stand on price and other
                                        terms of the contract, these negotiations could be utilized
                                        to strengthen our common political stand. We have always
                                        been, as you know, most anxious to maintain a close parallel
                                        policy with the United States Government towards Argentina,
                                        and in the present instance, you may certainly rely on us to
                                        do everything we can to avoid allowing the Argentines to
                                        derive any political comfort or encouragement from the
                                        renewal of the contract. It is indeed inherently a
                                        commercial question and we anticipate <pb n="176"
                                            xml:id="pg_176" facs="0232"/>a period of hard commercial
                                        bargaining before the negotiations reach their eventual
                                        conclusion. In the nature of things, we have no interest in
                                        giving the Argentines any particular reason to suppose that
                                        a successful outcome is assured in advance or in agreeing to
                                        terms which they could interpret as reflecting any
                                        condonation of their political shortcomings.</p>
                                    <p>Mr. Stettinius, in his recent conversation with the Minister
                                        of State,<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">Richard Law.</note>
                                        expressed the hope that the contract would cover only a
                                        short term.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">See <ref

                                        The question of the duration of the contract is, of course,
                                        a relative one, but we have to look to the needs of
                                        ourselves and our Allies during the cricitical post-war
                                        period as well as for the period of actual hostilities. We
                                        have no desire to conclude a contract running for a longer
                                        period than is strictly necessary. If nothing else, our own
                                        interests would dictate that the duration of the contract
                                        should be as short as possible since our meat purchases
                                        constitute one of the few weapons which we have left to
                                        protect our large interests in Argentina, which are
                                        threatened as never before by the present virulently
                                        nationalistic regime. This weapon would, for instance,
                                        normally be extremely useful in, say, a couple of years’
                                        time, when the imminent termination of the Mitre Law<note

                                        duty both to our own people and to certain of our Allies is
                                        to ensure that, during the acutely difficult post-war years,
                                        they shall be adequately fed; and the case made out by our
                                        Ministry of Food that only a longer contract will ensure
                                        this as regards meat is entirely convincing. I need not, I
                                        think, go into all the technical details including the
                                        reasons why it is so important that the Combined Food Board
                                        should be able to count not merely on obtaining Argentine
                                        meat at a reasonable commercial price, but on continuing to
                                        command the total exportable surplus. The British Food
                                        Mission in Washington are, of course, in possession of all
                                        the technical details involved and if it would interest the
                                        State Department to have a complete summary of the technical
                                        aspects of this complex question, we shall be ready to
                                        arrange for this to be given to them. Meanwhile, I trust
                                        that we can continue to enjoy the confidence of the United
                                        States Government while we play our difficult hand in this
                                        important matter which we shall hope to do without giving
                                        the Argentines any avoidable political advantages. We shall
                                        do our best to keep the Argentines guessing about all the
                                        aspects of this negotiation as far as is consistent with
                                        eventually bringing it to a successful conclusion and to see
                                        to it that the present regime derives no strength or
                                        authority from this commercial trans action in their own or
                                        anybody else’s eyes. In this we should, of course, be helped
                                        by the absence of embarrassing press speculation, whether
                                        emanating from Washington or London.”</p>

                                <item>The most important international economic problem of the
                                    transition and post-war periods will be the situation of the
                                    United Kingdom: the sterling–dollar relationship, the change in
                                    Britain’s creditor position, the prospects for British export
                                    trade, and the commercial and financial policies which she will
                                    adopt in the light of the situation. This problem has its long
                                    run aspect—associated with the loss of overseas investment; the
                                    probable reduction in shipping, international banking, and
                                    insurance earnings; and the difficulty of reestablishing and
                                    expanding British export markets in the post-war world. The main
                                    outlines of this problem have been developing for several
                                    decades, although war has accentuated the difficulties. It is
                                    the Department’s view that it is in the best interests both
                                    directly of the British and of the world in general if this long
                                    run problem is attacked by the adoption by the British of a
                                    liberal commercial policy with foreign exchange and investment

                                    defer to the armed forces in matters of strategic policy and
                                    decision. Nevertheless it is clear that one of the most
                                    important objectives of United States policy must be to bring
                                    the British into the war operations in the Far East to the
                                    greatest possible extent. The advantages of such a course are
                                    obvious in producing an early end of the war, with the resultant
                                    saving in human and material costs. The disadvantages of the

                                <item>It has been indicated that in “Phase 2” American production
                                    for war may be reduced by as much as 40 percent with a resultant
                                    re conversion to meet domestic civilian demands as well as to
                                    permit some increase in commercial exports. It is essential that
                                    there be a synchronized British reconversion program. The strain
                                    of five years of war, with bombing, severe rationing, and the
                                    dislocation of life produced by national service, will require,
                                    from the point of view of any government in the United Kingdom,
                                    substantial improvement in the conditions of civilian life. The
                                    necessities of British physical reconstruction and balances of
                                    payments will almost certainly mean that British civilian
                                    standards will remain far below those in the United States. This
                                    should be recognized here as a laudable determination of the
                                    British to restrict consumption in accordance with the realities
                                    of their economic position.</item>

                                <item>If British reconversion is coordinated with our own, it will
                                    be right and proper, and it should be possible to justify to the
                                    Congress and the American people, to continue lend-lease aid on
                                    a reasonable scale to the British during the continuance of the
                                    Pacific war. It is my understanding that the British as yet have
                                    made no definite proposals for their overall lend-lease needs in
                                    “Phase 2”, as they feel that the nature of these proposals must
                                    depend to a large degree on the strategic plans for the Far
                                    Eastern war. In view of the speed of military developments in
                                    Europe it is most important that we come to an early
                                    understanding with the British on this matter, so that a program
                                    of lend-lease can be worked out that will be fair to all
                                    concerned.</item>

                                    multilateral reduction in barriers to international trade. The

                                    restrictions, and discriminations constitute a very important
                                    part of our commercial policy program. The British must be urged
                                    to implement these arrangements, and to join with us—through the
                                    Article VII conversations and otherwise—in thorough

                                important, in Quebec, that you tell the Prime Minister how strongly
                                you feel about knocking down some of the trade barriers to get
                                somewhere in terms of world trade.</p>
                            <p>I have a feeling that the Prime Minister thinks that that is a pet
                                hobby of Secretary Hull’s and that you may not think it of great
                                importance.</p>
                            <p>I think it is essential to our future bargaining with Great Britain
                                that you disabuse the Prime Minister’s mind of this.</p>
                            <p>I rather think that he thinks that the genius of this program in
                                America lies with Secretary Hull, while the truth of the matter is
                                that it is a program that, from the beginning, has been pushed by
                                you.</p>

                                good deal of discussion within the several Government Departments
                                relative to our Lend Lease policy after the collapse of Germany.</p>

                            <p>It is my wish that no Department of the Government take unilateral
                                action in regard to any matters that concern Lease Lend, because the
                                implications of any such action are bound to affect other
                                Departments of the Government and, indeed, our whole national
                                policy. I am particularly anxious that any instructions which may
                                have been issued, or are about to be issued regarding Lease Lend
                                material or supplies to our allies after the collapse of Germany, be
                                immediately cancelled and withdrawn.</p>
                            <p>I intend to give instructions to all Departments relative to the
                                Lease Lend policy of this government at an early date.</p>
                            <p>Will you be sure, therefore, that your several bureaus and divisions

                                    <item>We get the impression that Marshal Stalin’s proposal was
                                        very tentative but we conclude that he is interested in it,
                                        in view of the fact that Marshal Vassilievsky referred to
                                        the matter in conversation with General Deane during the
                                        latter’s visit to the Russian front.<note n="7"
                                            xml:id="d115fn7">On July 22, 1944. See Deane, <ref

                                        conversation Marshal Vassilievsky stated that the Soviet
                                        General Staff would be interested in the formation of some
                                        sort of Combined Committee in Moscow, and would like to know
                                        what are the proposals of the Chiefs of Staff in this
                                        respect. It therefore appears that nothing is likely to
                                        materialise unless we make the next move. Whether we should,
                                        or should not, do so depends upon the character and scope of
                                        the responsibilities with which the proposed combined
                                        committee is to be charged.</item>

                                        the view that the relations of such a body to the Combined
                                        Chiefs of Staff would be very difficult, and that it might
                                        even claim to be the more representative body, and,
                                        therefore, to exercise jurisdiction over the Combined Chiefs
                                        of Staff. We emphasised that the representatives of such a
                                        body would not have the authority to make big decisions and
                                        that, in consequence, the organisation would serve no useful
                                        purpose, except as a means of improving liaison; and we
                                        added that this could be done better by improving the
                                        arrangements already existing in Washington, London and

                            <p>Premier Mikołajczyk in a broadcast message yesterday to the Polish
                                people on the fifth anniversary of the German attack on Poland made
                                reference to the struggle in Warsaw and addressed a direct appeal
                                for aid to Marshal Stalin, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister
                                Churchill. Defending the decision of the Polish forces in Warsaw to
                                fight in the open Mikołajczyk said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        airmen. Lately the latter were the only ones who helped you.

                                    <p>I address myself once again in public to Marshal Stalin,
                                        President Roosevelt, and Mr. Churchill: leaders of great
                                        powers, commanders of powerful and victorious land and air
                                        armies, Warsaw is waiting, the whole Polish nation is
                                        waiting, public opinion throughout the world is waiting. Do
                                        all you can to provide means for further fighting and to
                                        liberate this city and the population fighting in her ruins,
                                        drenched with blood. These people fight and die for Poland,
                                        but their desire to live for Poland is equally strong.”</p>

                                Ambassador said, however, he wished to make sure that the Department
                                of State was fully informed and therefore had brought in the

                                <p>The Polish Ambassador received an urgent secret telegram from
                                    Minister Romer dated London, September 3rd, concerning the
                                    situation of Warsaw and the most urgent necessity of help in the
                                    form of food, arms, munitions and medical supplies to the
                                    fighting garrison of the Polish Home Army. Foreign Minister
                                    Romer informs the Ambassador that Premier Mikołajczyk personally
                                    submitted to Prime Minister Churchill on September 1st the
                                    desperate situation in Warsaw, which the Germans have now
                                    threatened to burn down entirely.</p>
                                <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0243"/>
                                <p>The simultaneous evacuation of German forces from the eastern
                                    bank of the Vistula westwards appears to prove that the
                                    liberation of the town may be close. It is therefore of the
                                    utmost importance that the Polish Home Army fighting in Warsaw
                                    should be able to continue its fight and be helped at this
                                    moment by substantial aid from the air of arms, munitions, food
                                    and medical supplies. It is likewise urgent that the objectives
                                    held by the Germans be bombed.</p>
                                <p>In view of the decreasing effectiveness of the nightly very
                                    reduced nights of the Polish air crews from Bari, Prime Minister
                                    Churchill promised Premier Mikołajczyk once more to investigate
                                    the possibilities of one large-scale operation which would be
                                    undertaken by the British <gloss target="#t_RAF1">R.A.F.</gloss>
                                    from British and Italian bases and would not exclude even the
                                    risk of forced landings on Russian air bases. Unfortunately, the
                                    technical investigation carried out on September 2nd showed that
                                    this intention could not be carried out from bases accessible to
                                    the British forces.</p>
                                <p>The Polish Ambassador is instructed by Minister Romer
                                    confidentially to inform the competent authorities of the United
                                    States Government about the opinion of Prime Minister Churchill
                                    that there appears to exist the possibility for American Air
                                    Forces, at present closer to Warsaw than the British, to carry
                                    out such an operation.</p>
                                <p>The latest reports received by the Polish Government from the
                                    High Command of the Polish Home Army, dated September 2nd, are
                                    to the effect that the Germans succeeded in taking from the Home
                                    Army the district of “Old Town” (<hi rend="italic">Stare

                                    munitions are almost exhausted. The spirit of the soldiers is
                                    good. The population is suffering from lack of food, which has
                                    been rationed up to September 7th only, of water, of shelter, of
                                    clothing, and is in very bad sanitary conditions. The morale is
                                    still good, but it must be regarded as dependent on hope that
                                    the end of the fighting will come soon or that aid will really
                                    be forthcoming.</p>

                                            the events in War saw and by the terrible sufferings of
                                            the <gloss target="#t_Poles1">Poles</gloss> there.
                                            Whatever the rights and wrongs about the beginnings of
                                            the Warsaw rising, the people of Warsaw themselves
                                            cannot be held responsible for the decision taken. Our
                                            people cannot understand why no material help has been
                                            sent from outside to the <gloss target="#t_Poles1"
                                                >Poles</gloss> in Warsaw. The fact that such help
                                            could not be sent on account of your Government’s
                                            refusal to allow United States aircraft to land on
                                            aerodromes in Russian hands is now becoming publicly
                                            known. If on top of all this the <gloss
                                                target="#t_Poles1">Poles</gloss> in Warsaw should
                                            now be overwhelmed by the Germans, as we are told they
                                            must be within two or three days, the shock to public
                                            opinion here will be incalculable. The War Cabinet
                                            themselves find it hard to understand your Government’s
                                            refusal to take account of the obligations of the
                                            British and American Governments to help the <gloss

                                            Government’s action in preventing this help being sent
                                            seems <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0246"/>to us at

                                        our basic national policy in post-war settlements of this
                                        kind should seek to maintain the solidarity of the three
                                        great powers and in all other respects to establish
                                        conditions calculated to assure a long period of peace,
                                        during which, it may be hoped, arrangements will be
                                        perfected for the prevention of future world conflicts. The
                                        cardinal importance of this national policy is emphasized by
                                        a consideration of the fundamental and revolutionary changes
                                        in relative national military strengths that are being
                                        brought about in Europe as a result of the war.</p>
                                    <p>“It would seem clear that there cannot be a world war, or
                                        even a great war, which does not find one or more of the
                                        great military powers on each side. At the conclusion of the
                                        present war, there will be, for the foreseeable future, only
                                        three such powers—the United States, Britain, and Russia.
                                        Since it would seem in the highest degree unlikely that
                                        Britain and Russia, or Russia alone, would be aligned
                                        against the United States, it is apparent that any future
                                        world conflict in the foreseeable future will find Britain
                                        and Russia in opposite camps.</p>
                                    <p>“In appraising possibilities of this nature, the outstanding
                                        fact to be noted is the recent phenomenal development of the
                                        heretofore latent Russian military and economic strength—a
                                        development which seems certain to prove epochal in its
                                        bearing on future politico-military international
                                        relationships, and which has yet to reach the full scope
                                        attainable with Russian resources. In contrast, as regards
                                        Britain several developments have combined to lessen her
                                        relative military and economic strength and gravely to
                                        impair, if not preclude, her ability to offer effective
                                        military opposition to Russia on the continent except
                                        possibly in defensive operations in the Atlantic coastal
                                        areas. In a conflict between these two powers the disparity
                                        in the military strengths that they could dispose upon that
                                        continent would, under present conditions, be far too great
                                        to be overcome by our intervention on the side of Britain.
                                        Having due regard to the military factors
                                        involved—resources, manpower, geography and particularly our
                                        ability to project our strength across the ocean and exert
                                        it decisively <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0248"/>upon
                                        the continent—we might be able to successfully defend
                                        Britain, but we could not, under existing conditions, defeat
                                        Russia. In other words, we would find ourselves engaged in a
                                        war which we could not win even though the United States
                                        would be in no danger of defeat and occupation.</p>
                                    <p>“It is apparent that the United States should, now and in the
                                        future, exert its utmost efforts and utilize all its
                                        influence to prevent such a situation arising and to promote
                                        a spirit of mutual cooperation between Britain, Russia and
                                        ourselves. So long as Britain and Russia cooperate and
                                        collaborate in the interests of peace, there can be no great
                                        war in the foreseeable future.</p>
                                    <p>“The greatest likelihood of eventual conflict between Britain
                                        and Russia would seem to grow out of either nation
                                        initiating attempts to build up its strength, by seeking to
                                        attach to herself parts of Europe to the disadvantage and
                                        possible danger of her potential adversary. Having regard to
                                        the inherent suspicions of the Russians, to present Russia
                                        with any agreement on such matters as between the British
                                        and ourselves, prior to consultation with Russia, might well
                                        result in starting a train of events that would lead
                                        eventually to the situation we most wish to avoid.”</p>

                                its adamant attitude on the Baltic States, and [the policy?]
                                indicated in other areas have been far from encouraging in this
                                respect.</p>
                            <p>There is a danger that the Soviet Government may mistake friendliness
                                for weakness and continue to operate in the belief that it can
                                obtain all the benefits of cooperation with the United States and
                                Great Britain no matter what policies it pursues in regard to its
                                neighbors unless the British and ourselves demonstrate more
                                forcefully that observation by the Soviet Union of accepted
                                principles of international conduct is both to its own ultimate
                                advantage and essential to lasting cooperation with the Western
                                Powers.</p>
                            <p>Nothing should be done along political lines which might jeopardize
                                Soviet military cooperation against Germany but, as and when the
                                military situation in Europe permits, increased emphasis should be
                                placed on the principles upon which enduring cooperation must be
                                based. This would require greater willingness on our part to risk
                                Soviet displeasure and franker and more realistic discussions with
                                the Soviet Union in regard to its policies in Europe. It would, of
                                course, be against our interest to seek (or to follow the British in
                                seeking) points of friction or to obstruct or deny legitimate Soviet
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>It is nevertheless important that the Soviet Government realize that,
                                while we desire its cooperation in world affairs as much as it
                                desires ours, we do not intend to acquiesce in Soviet policies which
                                we consider internationally destructive merely for the sake of
                                avoiding unpleasant issues. Cooperation on that basis is perilously
                                close to collusion. A greater degree of firmness in our attitude and
                                policy toward the Soviet Union would avoid more serious difficulties
                                in the future and would place our relations with it on a firmer

                                arrangement with Mikołajczyk, in order that the Soviet-sponsored

                                by his persistent refusual to assist the British or ourselves in

                            <p>He may have come to believe that the strength of the Polish
                                Government forces both in Warsaw and elsewhere in Poland was such as
                                to make it unlikely that his Polish Committee could control the
                                situation if Mikołajczyk and a few of his ministers were allowed to
                                form a government in Warsaw. The reversal of his decision to aid the
                                insurgents may have been made in the thought that it would undermine

                            <p>Until Stalin has definitely closed the door to any compromise
                                solution with the Polish Government in London we should continue to
                                urge upon him in every possible manner the necessity of some
                                solution of the Polish question which would be acceptable to world
                                opinion. We should at the same time support Mikołajczyk and his
                                supporters in their efforts to reach a mutually satisfactory
                                agreement with Moscow. While any possibility remains of an agreement
                                between the Polish Government and the Soviet-sponsored Committee,
                                any indication on our part of a change of attitude toward the London
                                Polish Government would lessen the already slim changes of

                            <p>Should Stalin proceed, despite all our efforts and those of the

                                own group as the government of Poland, we will have to consider our
                                policy in the light of developments as they occur. In any event we
                                should move very slowly in extending any form of recognition to such

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear General McFarland</hi>: With reference
                                to our telephone conversation, I enclose a copy of a telegram which
                                a member of the British Embassy handed me last evening. That
                                telegram embodies the instructions sent by the British Foreign
                                Office to the British Ambassador at Moscow with regard to a joint
                                Anglo-American approach to the Russians with respect to Norway.</p>
                            <p>You will note that paragraph 5 of the enclosure suggests that the
                                State Department might send similar instructions to Ambassador
                                Harriman for the purpose of giving some political background to
                                General Deane.</p>
                            <p>Since the State Department is not informed as to the nature of the
                                instructions sent to General Deane, we are not in position to judge
                                how much of the background and suggestions contained in the British
                                telegram is already in Deane’s possession. I presume you have
                                briefed General Deane on the three points contained in numbered
                                paragraph 3. We do believe it advisable to give General Deane,
                                either <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0252"/>through Ambassador
                                Harriman or otherwise, some indication of the importance of
                                communicating to the Russians the fact that the planning question
                                was conceived some time ago in order to dispel possible Russian
                                suspicions that it is something improvised overnight, so to speak,
                                as a counterweight to possible entry of Russian troops into northern
                                Norway.</p>

                                <p>2874. As you may know, the Combined Chiefs of Staff have recently
                                    instructed the American and British Military missions in Moscow
                                    to discuss with the Russians the question of our plans for the

                                    discussed the political background. Burrows does not expect to
                                    be back for ten days, however, and United States Chiefs of Staff
                                    are anxious to begin these discussions without further delay in

                                            some time past been under strong political pressure from

                                            event of German withdrawal because of their fears of a

                                            fears are, in the Foreign Office view, exaggerated since

                            <p>I feel that I should report to the President at the earliest
                                convenient time and place. Now that the end of the war is in sight
                                our relations with the Soviets have taken a startling turn evident
                                during the last two months. They have held up our requests with
                                complete indifference to our interests and have shown an
                                unwillingness even to discuss pressing problems.</p>

                                at the end of June and formally presented it to the Foreign Office
                                in early July. No acknowledgement even of my letters or numerous
                                talks has been received. All requests for <gloss target="#t_PR1"
                                    >PR</gloss> unit have been unacted upon for the last several
                                weeks. Prior to that time they were operating several a day. No

                                has been received. There has been no reply to our request presented
                                a week ago followed by urgent conversation with Molotov to allow
                                General Eakcr’s bombing appraisal party to visit Ploeşti. The
                                Soviets’ indifference to world opinion regarding their unbending
                                policy toward Poland and ruthless attitude toward the uprising in
                                Warsaw are best described by Molotov’s statement that the Soviets
                                would judge their friends by those that accept the Soviet
                                    position.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">Molotov had made this

                            <p>I have been conscious since early in the year of a division among
                                Stalin’s advisors on the question of cooperation with us. It is now
                                my feeling that those who oppose the kind of cooperation we expect
                                have recently been getting their way and the policy appears to be
                                crystallizing to force us and the British to accept all Soviet
                                policies backed by the strength and prestige of Red Army.</p>

                            <p>Demands on us are becoming insistent. You have seen a part of it in

                                        pp. 1032</ref> ff.</note> in Washington. We have other
                                examples here. The general attitude seems to be that it is our
                                obligation to help Russia and accept her policies because she has
                                won the war for us.</p>
                            <p>I am convinced that we can divert this trend but only if we
                                materially change our policy toward the Soviet Government. I have
                                evidence that they have misinterpreted our generous attitude toward
                                them as a sign of weakness, and acceptance of their policies.</p>
                            <p>Time has come when we must make clear what we expect of them as the
                                price of our good will. Unless we take issue with the present policy
                                there is every indication the Soviet Union will become a world bully
                                wherever their interests are involved. This policy will reach into
                                China and the Pacific as well when they can turn their attention in
                                that direction. No written agreement[s] can be of any value unless
                                they are carried out in a spirit of give and take and recognition of
                                the interests of other people.</p>
                            <p>I am disappointed but not discouraged. The job of getting the Soviet
                                Government to play a decent role in international affairs is however
                                going to be more difficult than we had hoped. The favorable factors
                                are still the same. Ninety percent of the Russian people want friend
                                ship with us and it is much to the interest of the Soviet Government
                                to develop it. It is our problem to strengthen the hand of those
                                around Stalin who want to play the game along our lines and to show
                                Stalin that the advice of the counselors of a tough policy is
                                leading him into difficulties.</p>
                            <p>I realize I cannot in a cable convey to you a fully comprehensible
                                picture of the perplexing developments. However, what I say is fully
                                endorsed by General Deane, the air officers here and the Embassy
                                officers.</p>
                            <p>The relation[s] of Deane and our other officers with the Red Air
                                Force are good. The Soviet officers have shown embarrassment at the
                                attitude expressed through the Foreign Office. The influences that I
                                speak of are as unpopular with this group as with us. When it comes
                                to the question of what we should do in dealing with the situation I
                                am not going to propose any drastic action but a firm but friendly
                                    <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> attitude. In some cases
                                where it has been possible for us to show a firm hand we have been

                                                operational plans.</p>
                                            <p>The Soviet Government would like an unprejudiced
                                                commission to be organized with the object of
                                                ascertaining exactly by whose order the rising in
                                                Warsaw was undertaken and who was to blame for the
                                                fact that Soviet Military Command was not informed
                                                thereof in advance. No command in the world, neither
                                                British nor American, can tolerate the fact that a
                                                rising is organized in a large city opposite the
                                                front line of its troops without the knowledge of
                                                that command and contrary to its operational plans.
                                                Of course Soviet Command cannot be an exception.
                                                Undoubtedly if before the Warsaw rising Soviet
                                                Command had been asked about the desirability of
                                                organizing a rising in Warsaw at the beginning of
                                                August, the Soviet Command would have advised
                                                against such an attempt because the Soviet troops
                                                who had advanced fighting for over 500 kilometres
                                                and were in a state of fatigue were not at that time
                                                prepared to take Warsaw by storm bearing in mind
                                                that the Germans had at that time transferred their
                                                tank reserves from the west to the Warsaw area.</p>
                                            <p>Nobody will be able to reproach Soviet Government
                                                with the allegation that they rendered inadequate
                                                aid to the Polish people including Warsaw. The most
                                                practical form of help is active military operations
                                                of the Soviet troops against the German invaders of
                                                Poland and the liberation of more than one fourth of
                                                Poland. All this is the work of the Soviet troops
                                                and of the Soviet troops only who are shedding their
                                                blood for the liberation of Poland. There is again

                                                fallen into the hands of the Germans. However, if
                                                you are so firmly convinced of the efficacy of this

                                            <p>As regards your attempt to make Soviet Government in
                                                any degree responsible for Warsaw adventure and for
                                                the sacrifices of the Warsaw people, the Soviet
                                                Government cannot regard this otherwise than as a
                                                wish to shift responsibility “from a sick head to a
                                                clear one”. The same must be said on the point that
                                                the Soviet Government’s position in the Warsaw
                                                question is apparently contrary to the spirit of
                                                Allied co-operation. There can be no doubt that if
                                                the British Government had taken steps to see that
                                                the Soviet Command had been warned of proposed
                                                Warsaw rising in good time, then events in Warsaw
                                                would have taken a totally different turn. Why did
                                                the British Government not find it necessary to warn
                                                the Soviet Government of this? Was it not a
                                                repetition of what happened in April 1943 when

                                    <p>This is an unexpected and remarkable climb down. That it is
                                        tucked away in the middle of a preposterous Pi-Jaw is true
                                        to Kremlin form. They are still not grown up enough to come
                                        clean when they know they have made a bad mistake. It would
                                        I think be imprudent in us to let any natural inclination to
                                        counter all verbiage divert us from this most important if
                                        belated surrender. I suggest that in the belief that there
                                        may be still in Warsaw something to save, that most
                                        immediate instructions be sent to British and American
                                        Military Missions to arrange co-operation that is now
                                        offered. The whole thing seems to me to give fresh hopes of
                                        a settlement with Poland.</p>

                                receive this in full. Briefly, however, after a lengthy recital of
                                the circumstances and a statement that the really effective aid will
                                come from the advance of the Bed Army, the message states in
                                paraphrase as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“In addition there is the form of assistance to the people in
                                        Warsaw which can hardly be considered effective; namely, the
                                        dropping by airplane of weapons, food and medical supplies.
                                        We have dropped both weapons and food for the insurgents in
                                        Warsaw on several occasions, but each time we have received
                                        information that these supplies have fallen into German
                                        hands. If you are so firmly convinced, however, of the
                                        efficacy of this form of assistance and if you insist that
                                        the Soviet Command organize jointly with, the Americans and
                                        British such aid, the Soviet Government is prepared to agree
                                        to it. It will be necessary, however, to render this aid in
                                        accordance with a prearranged plan.”</p>

                            <p>The message ends by implying that the British were partly to blame
                                for the fact that the Soviet Command was not informed in advance of
                                the Warsaw uprising. Reference is also made to British failure to
                                prevent the <gloss target="#t_Poles1">Poles</gloss> from their
                                action in connection with the Katyn incident.</p>
                            <p>This message is obviously an extremely shrewd statement for the
                                record, and places the responsibility now on the British and us for
                                the decision whether the dropping of supplies should be attempted at
                                this late date. I have no recent information as to the size of the
                                area still held by the Insurgents in Warsaw and whether it is
                                practicable to parachute supplies from a sufficiently high altitude
                                to avoid unconscionable losses to our flyers. I assume urgent
                                instructions will be given General Deane or myself on what our
                                position now is and whether or not negotiations with the Red Army
                                staff are to be entered into to render aid.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. President</hi>, The reports which the Polish
                                Government receive from Warsaw show that the situation is desperate
                                and that the fight against the overwhelming German power may cease
                                at any moment, unless sustained from outside.</p>
                            <p>Our urgent appeals for a large scale operation which would combine
                                the bombing of German concentrations with the dropping of supplies
                                at [<hi rend="italic">to?</hi>] the home Army in Warsaw are still
                                under consideration by the British Government and no decision has
                                been taken so far. This decision if favorable may come too late.</p>
                            <p>I therefore beseech you Mr. President and you Mr. Prime Minister to
                                take a bold and immediate decision which could save Warsaw and its
                                inhabitants from total destruction and at the same time give new
                                hope to millions of <gloss target="#t_Poles1">Poles</gloss> to whom
                                the fight in Warsaw is a symbol of Poland’s will to live.</p>
                            <p>I also feel obliged to stress that should the Warsaw rising be
                                crushed by the Germans without a last minute attempt at succour from
                                Poland’s mighty western allies, the tragedy of Warsaw may cast a
                                deep and lasting shadow on the Polish nation’s attude towards its
                                traditional friends. I beg you to weigh this in your minds, Mr.
                                President and Mr. Prime Minister, when taking your decision at this
                                fateful hour.</p>

                                    Bohlen forwarded Ciechanowski’s memorandum to Hopkins with the
                                    following comment: “It is obvious that the British have informed
                                    the Polish Government of the change in attitude of the Soviet
                                    Government. While it does not add anything to what the President
                                    already knows, it probably should go on to him.” Hopkins

                            <p>Bonomi’s Government has successfully weathered its first two months.
                                Its position, however, will remain precarious without tangible proof
                                of Allied sympathy, especially as the industrial north is
                                liberated.</p>
                            <p>The British last May proposed the conclusion of a “preliminary peace
                                    treaty”.<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">See <ref

                                end the anomalous situation whereby Italy is both defeated enemy and
                                co-belligerent, clear the way for normal relationships, and yet not
                                prejudice the ultimate peace settlement. We agreed to discuss
                                possible terms but differed from the British thesis that no
                                concessions should meanwhile be made to Italy. The more urgent
                                problems should be solved wherever possible without delay. Mr.
                                Churchill has now told Ambassador Kirk in Rome that he disapproved
                                of a preliminary treaty and preferred <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1"

                                accorded by the Soviet.”<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">This passage is
                                    quoted from Kirk’s telegram No. 231 to Hull, dated August 24,
                                    1944, not printed (865.01/8–2444).</note> Press reports
                                portraying the Prime Minister as sympathetic to the Bonomi
                                Government and convinced that the Italian[s] have “worked their pas
                                sage” foreshadow a more favorable British policy toward Italy. We
                                should welcome such a change in attitude, having felt for some time
                                that it is to the general interest to strengthen Italian confidence
                                in democratic government and in the democratic powers.</p>
                            <p>The most urgent problems are those of civilian relief and
                                rehabilitation. The physical obstacles to their solution have been
                                augmented by divergences in British and American views.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Problems</hi>. The civilian supply program
                                thus far has been entirely a military responsibility, of which the
                                U.S. Army now wishes to be relieved. It is proposed to finance
                                United States supplies, except such limited supplies as the Army may
                                temporarily continue to provide, by making available to the Italians
                                under appropriate Allied controls the equivalent in dollars of lire
                                paid to our troops in Italy. Though willing for us to finance our
                                own share in this way, the British have questioned extending the
                                present limited military scope of the supply program and appear
                                sensitive about the reaction of our European Allies to any
                                appreciable aid to Italy. We believe the most essential <pb n="208"
                                    xml:id="pg_208" facs="0264"/>items of rehabilitation should be
                                included to help the Italian economy to begin functioning and are
                                seeking British agreement.</p>
                            <p>We have intended proposing at the <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1"
                                    >UNRRA</gloss> Council meeting in September limited <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss> participation in relief
                                activities in Italy, involving care and repatriation of displaced
                                persons and public health activities including the furnishing of
                                needed medical supplies and technical assistance. The total
                                estimated cost would be between 35 and 50 million dollars. There has
                                been some indication of British reluctance to support such a
                                program.</p>
                            <p>The present food supply in Italy would suffice for bare subsistence
                                rations if means of transportation from one region to another were
                                available. Additional trucks and coal to operate local railroads are
                                needed.</p>
                            <p>Other major questions now in the foreground are:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Allied Control Machinery</hi>. Military interest in
                                the Allied Control Commission is decreasing. It will be necessary to
                                determine its future status, particularly whether its control
                                functions should continue after they are no longer needed to protect
                                military operations. This will depend on (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                                the status to be accorded Italy, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Italy’s
                                relations with bordering states pending a final peace settlement,
                                and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the internal situation. Such of its
                                economic functions as must continue after termination of military
                                control can be handled either through a control organization as at
                                present or an economic mission to the Italian Government.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Kirk believes that the Commission should now be headed by
                                a civilian, who would continue for the present to be responsible to
                                the Theater Commander. Kirk also recommends appointment of an
                                American, who should be an expert on economic matters. The British
                                might agree. It is expected that the Commission’s Economic Section
                                will shortly be staffed by civilian experts, continuing, however,
                                under military command. Many other functions of the Commission can
                                soon be abandoned or turned over to the Italians.</p>

                                to furnish combat equipment for three divisions of the Corps of
                                Liberation. General Wilson also recommends increasing the Italian

                                have been based on the criteria: (1) territory should not be taken
                                from Italy merely to punish a defeated enemy or reward an ally; (2)
                                ethnic considerations should predominate, though economic and
                                strategic factors would be kept in mind; (3) as to colonies, native
                                welfare is the first concern; other colonial empires should not be
                                aggrandized by the addition of Italian colonies; and, if Italian
                                colonies are placed under international trusteeship, efforts might
                                be made to place under similar trusteeship at least some other

                            <p>The plight of the Italian people is serious as a result of Nazi and
                                Fascist rule and the battle destruction on its soil. The accumulated
                                result of years of undernourishment and the destruction caused by
                                the fighting has already begun to show up and is likely to show up
                                in accelerated form in the near future. From available information,
                                including the official Allied government medical opinion, the
                                general health of the people seems to be bad. Serious outbreaks of
                                illness are to be expected beginning with winter conditions. The low
                                resistance of the people is said to be the result of continued low
                                consumption under Fascist occupation. The dangerous period is said
                                to be from January to July, 1945. Increased food supply is
                                prescribed by the Allied Control <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211"
                                    facs="0267"/>Commission Health Subcommission. Any added
                                quantities of food needed will obviously require more shipping space
                                than presently allocated shipping. In view of the responsibility of
                                the Allied governments, present policy should be amended to include
                                adequate shipping allocation immediately.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">ii. italian unemployment</hi></p>
                            <p>Universal unemployment is foreseen for the coining winter, mainly due
                                to the thoroughness of the demolition of power plants by the enemy
                                forces. Next in importance to an increased food supply will be a
                                partial restoration of power. Without adequate food supply and
                                partial restoration of manufacturing the result may well be rioting,
                                bloodshed and anarchy. Without these two basic aids the Italian
                                people and the goverenment will be in a desperate plight. A
                                relatively slight change in present policies may help to correct
                                this situation.</p>

                            <p>The present condition of transportation is haphazard and grossly in
                                adequate. Any plan to maintain a food supply and to put the Italian
                                people in a position where they can help themselves must include
                                adequate transportation. Adequate transportation should be made
                                available following relief of the strain caused by military
                                necessity. Food, medical and other vital supplies landed in Italy
                                are of no use unless they are gotten to the people who vitally need
                                them. To do this adequate transportation is essential.</p>

                            <p>It is desirable to take every step necessary to develop the

                            <p>The Italian mind is friendly toward the Allies but confused. The
                                difficulties arise from an inability to understand the distinction
                                between the status of a defeated enemy as against the status of a
                                co-belligerent. Despite the fact that there are Italian divisions
                                fighting side by side with the Allies, and despite the fact that
                                there is unrestricted use of Italian resources to serve Allied
                                military needs, there are still Italians held as prisoners of
                                war.</p>
                            <p>It is generally believed that government responsibility in liberated
                                Italy might well be placed without any major restrictions in the
                                hands of the Italian government, that the formal state of war
                                between the Allies and Italy should be discontinued, and that the
                                Allied Control Commission in liberated Italy should be abolished and
                                its functions placed in the hands of civilian experts.</p>

                                and Hungary is contemplated in present plans, unless it is found
                                that these countries have surpluses of foodstuffs or products useful
                                in the war, for the handling of which American personnel in Allied
                                missions might be desirable.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. Army has set up, under authorization of the President, a
                                combined Anglo-American Military Headquarters for relief and

                                British personnel will number several thousand. On our initiative an

                                and for British political ends. Since these territories would be
                                supplied by <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss> after the
                                military period, it also seems desirable to have <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss> on the ground at once.</p>
                            <p>There has been some difference of opinion between the British and
                                Americans as to the extent of <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1"
                                    >UNRRA</gloss>’s responsibility during the military period. The
                                American position is that <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss>
                                should be given the maximum possible responsibility under the
                                direction of the military headquarters. The British would prefer to
                                limit <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss>’s role principally to
                                the furnishing of certain personnel who would, as individuals,
                                advise and assist the military. The Combined Civil Affairs Committee
                                is now trying to reach agreement on this point. The British plan for
                                the distribution of supplies in Albania and Yugoslavia has
                                contemplated delivery of supplies at ports, to the local
                                authorities, with practically no control to assure their
                                distribution in accordance with our policy of non-discrimination
                                because of race, creed or political affiliation. The American plan
                                urges agreements with local authorities providing for such
                                non-discriminatory distribution, and sufficient personnel, either of
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss> or the military, within
                                the countries to make sure of compliance with this policy. We feel
                                strongly that relief and supplies should not be used as a political
                                weapon to help any one faction. Particularly in the case of
                                Yugoslavia the scheme of de livery to the people easiest at hand
                                would be sure to give to that faction a powerful implement in the
                                civil strife within the country. It is to the American long-range
                                interest that we should not become a party to such a program. A
                                clear understanding with the British on this point is essential.</p>
                            <p>The British plan for Greece envisages a rather elaborate military
                                organization to supervise distribution, restore port facilities,
                                railroads and other utilities. This work will also be facilitated by
                                the organizations already familiar with the problem and the trained
                                personnel available.</p>
                            <p>We think the Russians should be fully informed of all these
                                activities, through a representative who would be in close touch
                                with the <hi rend="italic">combined</hi> military headquarters.
                                Suspicions would be allayed and a precedent established which might
                                advantageously be used in reverse in other areas where Russia is
                                primarily concerned. There has been a reluctance on the part of a
                                number of British officials to agree to keeping the Russians fully
                                informed.</p>
                            <p>One of the major problems is the lack of contact with the military
                                authorities of the Governments in question. Agreements providing for
                                their cooperation would be desirable with a view to securing both in
                                formation and the utilization of the services, personnel and
                                administration <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0270"/>which will
                                be under their control. In the case of Greece it has now been
                                proposed that the Theater Commander be authorized to discuss these
                                problems with the Greek authorities.</p>
                            <p>The Yugoslav Government presents a particular problem in this
                                connection, since the reported unity established between the
                                Government-in-exile and the Tito organization is of a very dubious
                                nature, with the additional complication that neither of them has
                                control or more than a claim to authority in Serbia, the heart of
                                the country. It may, therefore, be necessary to continue the
                                planning without much consultation with Yugoslav officials until
                                there is some clarification of the authority and popular support of
                                the respective groups. Unfortunately, the Yugoslav officials have
                                been so preoccupied with their political troubles that they seem to
                                have made no serious plans of their own. Actual relief operations
                                may in fact have to be postponed while the civil strife
                                continues.</p>
                            <p>In Albania there is no government with which to deal. Civil affairs
                                operations will of necessity require considerable improvisation, but
                                should present no major problems.</p>

                            <p>The Hungarians have failed to take any realistic action to withdraw
                                from the war, though they have repeatedly avowed their desire to do
                                so. The difficulty has been their hope that the “Anglo-Americans”
                                would protect them against Soviet Russia, and their unwillingness to
                                part with territories acquired with German aid. The country is now
                                in ferment, however, and events may move rapidly.</p>

                            <p>The United States does not contemplate participation in military
                                operations in Hungary or in the occupation of that country. American
                                troops in that area could probably be used more effectively, in the
                                    <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0271"/>political sense, than
                                either British or Soviet armies, but such participation would
                                inevitably involve this Government as an active agent in the
                                political questions of Southeastern Europe. Although planning for
                                civil affairs administration in Hungary after surrender is under the
                                jurisdiction of <gloss target="#t_AFHQ1">AFHQ</gloss> in the
                                Mediterranean Theater, American representatives have taken no part
                                in whatever planning has been done. The United States will, however,
                                desire political representatives in Hungary in the period after
                                surrender. Such representation is desirable for the execution of the
                                political terms of the armistice, for sup porting our general
                                objectives of promoting a just and stable political and territorial
                                settlement, as well as for securing accurate first-hand political
                                and economic information, and protecting American interests.</p>
                            <p>As a long-term objective the United States favors the establishment
                                of a broadly-based provisional government, designed to carry through
                                by democratic means the transition to a permanent regime. There are
                                revolutionary forces in Hungary working for land reform, electoral
                                reform and the overthrow of the present ruling group. We acknowledge
                                the need and the strong public demand for changes in the Hungarian
                                system, and must expect that these reforms will not be accomplished
                                without some violence.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the territorial settlement, the United States favors, as
                                a matter of principle, the restoration of the pre-Munich frontiers,
                                and any consideration of the boundary disputes between Hungary and
                                its neighbors should start from that point. However, we do not
                                regard the pre-Munich boundaries as unchangeable and believe certain
                                changes to be desirable in the interest of a stable settlement.</p>
                            <p>Thus, in the case of the frontier with Czechoslovakia, if an
                                opportunity arises for revision by agreement which would leave to
                                Hungary certain overwhelmingly Magyar-inhabited districts, the
                                United States would favor such a solution. In the case of the
                                frontier with Yugoslavia, the United States sees some merit in a
                                compromise solution which would leave to Hungary the northern part
                                of the Voyvodina, although this Government should not, we feel,
                                press for such a solution. In the case of the frontier with Rumania,
                                the American position will be more or less frozen by our agreement
                                to the armistice terms for Rumania which provide for the restoration

                                Germany and France. In May, General Wilson, Supreme Allied Commander
                                in the Mediterranean, asked the Combined Chiefs of Staff for a
                                directive to allow him to plan for the occupation of southeastern

                                took this matter up with the President and obtained his permission
                                to agree to the tripartite control of Austria on the understanding
                                that I would in no way commit us respecting the size of the

                                withdrawal of more divisions from the Italian Front. This of course
                                was the consequence of the great weakening of our Armies in Italy
                                and has taken place entirely since the attack on the Riviera.<note

                                Alexander began about three weeks ago to plan with Clark to turn or
                                pierce the Apennines. For this purpose the British 13 Corps of four
                                divisions has been placed under General Clark’s orders and we have
                                been able to supply him with the necessary artillery of which his
                                army had been deprived. This army of eight divisions—four American
                                and four British—is now grouped around Florence in a northerly
                                axis.</p>

                                able to concentrate ten British or British controlled divisions

                                consequently able to form a much clearer impression of the modern
                                battlefield than is possible from the kinds of pinnacles and perches
                                to which I have hitherto been confined.</p>
                            <p>The plan is that the Eighth Army of ten divisions very heavily
                                weighted in depth will endeavour to pierce the Gothic Line and turn
                                the whole enemy’s position entering the Po Valley on the level of
                                Rimini but at the right moment depending on the reactions of the
                                enemy Mark Clark will strike with his eight divisions and the
                                elements of both armies will converge to Bologna. If all goes well I
                                hope that the advance will be much more rapid after that and that
                                the continued heavy fighting will prevent further harm being done to
                                Eisenhower by the withdrawal of divisions from Italy.</p>

                                Tito’s people will be awaiting us in Istria. What the condition of

                                    >Supra.</hi></note> I was very glad to receive your account of
                                the way in which General Wilson has concentrated his forces in Italy
                                and has now renewed the offensive. My Chiefs of Staff feel that a
                                vigorous attack, <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0279"/>using all
                                the forces available, should force the enemy into the Po Valley. The
                                enemy may then choose to withdraw entirely from northern Italy.
                                Since such action on his part might enable the enemy to release
                                divisions for other fronts, we must do our best to destroy his
                                forces while we have them in our grasp. I am confident that General
                                Wilson has this as his objective.</p>
                            <p>With an offensive under way and being pressed full strength in Italy,
                                I am sure that General Eisenhower will be satisfied that everything
                                possible is being done in the Mediterranean to assist him by mauling
                                German divisions which might otherwise be moved against his forces
                                in the near future. I understand all available British resources in
                                the Mediterranean are being put into Italy. We are pressing into
                                France all reinforcements and resources we can in order to guarantee
                                that General Eisenhower will be able to maintain the impetus of the
                                joint victories our forces have already won. With the smashing
                                success of our invasion of southern France and the Russians now
                                crumbling the enemy flank in the Balkans, I have great hopes that
                                complete and final victory will not be long delayed.</p>
                            <p>It is my thought that we should press the German Army in Italy
                                vigorously with every facility we have available and suspend
                                decision on the future use of General Wilson’s armies until the
                                results of his campaign are better known and we have better
                                information as to what the Germans may do.</p>

                            <p>Now all operations in Italy are conceived and executed by General
                                Alexander in accordance with his general directives from the Supreme
                                Commander. You will see that he is now in contact for twenty miles
                                on the Adriatic flank with the Gothic line, and a severe battle will
                                be fought by the Eighth Army. Also General Clark with the Fifth Army
                                has made an advance from the direction of Florence. I have impressed
                                most strongly upon General Alexander the importance of pressing with
                                his utmost strength to destroy the enemy’s armed forces as well <pb
                                    n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0280"/>as turn his line. It will
                                not be easy for the Germans to effect a general retreat from the
                                Gothic line over the Alps especially if we can arrive in the
                                neighbourhood of Bologna. The western passes and tunnels into France
                                are already blocked by your advance into the Rhone Valley. Only the
                                direct route to Germany is open. We shall do our utmost to engage,
                                harry and destroy the enemy. The decisive battle has yet, however,
                                to be fought.</p>

                                <item>In view of the fact that the enemy on the Italian front has
                                    been weakened by four of his best divisions, we no longer ask
                                    for further American reinforcements beyond the 92nd Division,
                                    which I understand will shortly reach us. On the other hand, I
                                    take it for granted that no more will be withdrawn from Italy,
                                    i.e., that the four divisions of Clark’s army and the elements
                                    remaining with them will continue there: and that General
                                    Alexander should make his plans on that basis. So much for the
                                    present.</item>

                                    armies in Italy have been destroyed or unluckily made their
                                    escape. This employment can only take the form of a movement
                                    first to Istria and Trieste and ultimately upon Vienna. Should
                                    the war come to an end in a few months, as may well be possible,
                                    none of these questions will arise. Anyhow, we can talk this

                                    assistance from the French Forces of the Interior have produced
                                    a situation in which the whole of southeastern France east of
                                    the Rhone and south of Lyons as far east as Nice is under the
                                    control of the Allied armies. Some 50,000 prisoners have been
                                    captured and very heavy losses have been inflicted on the enemy
                                    though some 1½ divisions have escaped to the north after having
                                    suffered heavy losses in men and material. The capture ahead of
                                    schedule of the ports of Toulon and Marseilles coupled with our
                                    unexpected success in securing control of the Port de Bouc
                                    practically undamaged have resulted in a situation in which by
                                    the middle of September the ports of Southern France will be
                                    able to handle any foreseeable demands which may be placed upon
                                    them. Subsequently the logistical bottle neck will be the
                                    capacity of the railway leading north through the Rhone Valley,
                                    but thanks to the speed of our advance and the con sequent
                                    reduction in the expected scale of demolitions, Seventh Army
                                    expect to be able to maintain a force of one armoured division
                                    and four infantry divisions north of Lyons by 15th September at
                                    earliest. By 1st October it is estimated that a double line of
                                    railway will be working as far as Lyons which will by that date
                                    place the supply facilities for Allied armies operating in
                                    southeastern France on a satisfactory basis. A preliminary
                                    estimate, taking into account facilities offered by the use of
                                    the Rhone Canal, some 10,000 tons per day might be delivered in
                                    the Lyons area from that date. The general tactical plan of

                                    that after the capture of Lyons the general grouping of his
                                    forces will be that the French Armée “B” will undertake the
                                    protection of the right flank facing the Franco-Italian frontier
                                    and will operate east of the Rhone with an axis of advance
                                    Bourg–Besangon. In the execution of its security mission along
                                    the Franco-Italian frontier it will be assisted by the United
                                    States Divisional Airborne Division, and First Special Service
                                    Force. At the same time the VI American Corps will be regrouped
                                    so as to operate west of the Rhone on the line
                                    Autun–Dijon–Langres with the object of making contact with the
                                    American Third Army. I would propose that at this stage of the
                                    operations the command of the forces in France should be
                                    transferred to General Eisenhower. While the forces at present
                                    employed under the command of the Seventh Army might not appear
                                    to be of sufficient magnitude to warrant the formation of 6th
                                    Army Group, I consider that in view of the length of
                                    communications, the very heavy responsibilities for port
                                    maintenance and civil affairs and matters connected with the
                                    French resistance movement together with the possibility that
                                    forces from the right wing of American armies already in France
                                    might either be placed under its command or maintained <pb

                                    approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff I am sending General
                                    Devers to consider plans with General Eisenhower. As regards
                                    administration, I have sent a planning representative to <gloss
                                        target="#t_SHAEF1">SHAEF</gloss> to discuss the time when

                                    administrative responsibility. I would suggest that this matter
                                    be left for final settlement between <gloss target="#t_SHAEF1"
                                        >SHAEF</gloss> and my Headquarters. As regards the large
                                    areas in France west of the Rhone, I consider that no military
                                    action is required to deal with such small German forces as are
                                    still in this area and which are being rapidly rounded up by the
                                    French Forces of the Interior, and I feel that any divergence of
                                    regular troops would be a waste of effort.</item>

                                    General Eaker and General Spaatz proposals for the disposition
                                    of United States tactical air forces between Italy and southern
                                    France which have my full approval and which are now being
                                    discussed with General Eisenhower. Their general effect would be
                                    that continued offensive operations in the autumn and winter by
                                    the Allied armies in Italy would continue to receive very
                                    powerful air support from United States Army Air Force
                                    fighter-bombers as well as by medium bombers. The detailed
                                    deployment and distribution of the tactical air forces cannot
                                    and need not be decided until we see the outcome of the present
                                    offensive in the Po Valley. Meanwhile I am satisfied that that
                                    offensive as well as the operations in the <gloss

                                    effective support. At the same time certain administrative
                                    measures such as holding up the shipping to France of aviation
                                    engineers and steel planking have been taken to facilitate any
                                    redeployment of the tactical air forces that may be decided

                            <p>In the Italian Theatre the enemy now has a total of some 26 divisions
                                which are estimated to be the equivalent of some 16 to 17. As a
                                result of the deterioration in the situation in northern France the
                                Germans have withdrawn two <hi rend="italic">Panzer</hi> Grenadier
                                Divisions from this theatre which have now been identified in
                                central France. On the other hand the success of our cover plans
                                which have been designed to make the enemy think that one of our
                                objects was to secure Genoa and the Ligurian Coast together with the
                                enemy’s fear that the landings in southern France might be the
                                prelude to an invasion of Italy from the west, have resulted in the
                                enemy disposing some five divisions, including three Italian
                                divisions to meet this threat. As a result his forces holding the
                                Gothic Line have been considerably weakened, and until the last few
                                days the enemy did not apparently appreciate the threat <pb n="227"
                                    xml:id="pg_227" facs="0283"/>to his left flank. He has, however,
                                now realised to some extent the seriousness of this threat and has
                                moved two divisions into the line north west of Pesaro and further
                                movements to this flank may well be expected. With the reduction in
                                the number of divisions available to him consequent upon the
                                decision to launch Operation <gloss target="#t_Dragoon1"><hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">Dragoon</hi></gloss>, General Alexander
                                changed the plan for the major offensive in Italy, which was to be
                                launched at the end of August. Whereas in the original plan the main
                                blow was to be launched on the general, axis Florence-Bologna with
                                the object of breaking the enemy’s centre and pinning the eastern
                                portion of his forces back against the sea, the new plan is to
                                launch the main blow along the Adriatic Coast north of Ancona where
                                the Apennines present the least obstacle to movement. This main
                                offensive was started on 26th August and is being conducted by the
                                Eighth Army with a force of nine divisions. Good progress is being
                                made and considerable penetration[s] of the Gothic Line have been
                                made on a front extending some 20 miles westwards from Pesaro. As
                                soon as the enemy starts to move reserves to this area, General
                                Alexander plans to start a second offensive to be launched by the
                                Fifth U.S. Army which now commands the XIII British Corps northeast
                                of Florence in the direction of Bologna. I have every hope that as a
                                result of these two offensives the Allied armies will secure control
                                of the line Padua–Verona–Brescia within a few weeks and thus secure
                                the destruction of Kesselring’s Army by preventing its withdrawal
                                through the Alpine passes. To complete this task it will be
                                necessary to have available the full resources now at General
                                Alexander’s disposal. Further the limited communication facilities
                                which are available to the enemy in northern Italy point to the fact
                                that the use of the air will be a major factor in completing his
                                destruction and facilitating our advance. There will therefore be
                                ample scope for the employment of medium bomber forces throughout
                                the whole operation and it is also to be noted that if medium
                                bombers are established in the Florence–Ancona area, heavy and
                                sustained attacks can be delivered by such air forces well into
                                Austria. In view of the developments which are daily occurring in
                                the general war situation it does not appear to me possible to
                                undertake any further definite commitments. Should, however, the war
                                be further prolonged and the enemy endeavour to withdraw from Greece
                                and the Balkans with the object of holding a line from Trieste
                                through Zagreb and Belgrade to Turnu Severin and the Transylvanian
                                Mountains, the best course would be to regroup our forces and to
                                move northeastwards with the object of securing control of the
                                Ljubljana Gap. Such an operation would require the maximum
                                co-operation with Tito’s forces and the occupation of the port of
                                Trieste. Amphibious resources in this theatre are not available to
                                mount a seaborne attack on Trieste this <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228"
                                    facs="0284"/>year and consequently unless German resistance
                                collapses it is unlikely that another major offensive could be
                                mounted until the spring of 1945. Concurrently with an advance
                                northeastwards it will be well to clear the enemy completely from
                                northwestern Italy and this should be completed as rapidly as
                                possible with the minimum forces required to establish control and
                                law and order. Provided that demolitions through the Maritime Alps

                                <item>All information goes to show that the enemy is faced with an
                                    increasingly difficult situation throughout the Balkans and the
                                    Islands of the Aegean. This situation is likely to be further
                                    accentuated by the situation in Roumania and the probable
                                    defection of Bulgaria. Though it is estimated that a proportion
                                    of the troops are suitable from the training and equipment point
                                    of view for use elsewhere, there is little evidence at the
                                    moment that any substantial withdrawal is taking place. However,
                                    I anticipate that the Germans now faced with the necessity of
                                    finding some reserves in the Balkan area will be forced to
                                    regroup and make available four or five divisions if they are to
                                    hold either the Bulgarian frontier or the Zagreb–Belgrade line

                            <p>I share your confidence that the Allied divisions we have in Italy
                                are sufficient to do the task before them and that the battle
                                commanders will press the battle unrelentingly with the objective of
                                shattering the enemy forces. After breaking the German forces on the
                                Gothic Line, we must go on to use our divisions in the way which
                                best aids General Eisenhower’s decisive drive into the enemy
                                homeland.</p>
                            <p>As to the exact employment of our forces in Italy in the future, this
                                is a matter we can discuss at <gloss target="#t_Octagon1"><hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">Octagon</hi></gloss>. It seems to me that
                                American forces should be used to the westward but I am completely
                                open-minded on this and, in any event, this depends on the progress
                                of the present battle in Italy and also in France where I strongly
                                feel that we must not stint in any way the forces needed to break
                                quickly through the western defenses of Germany.</p>
                            <p>The credit for the great Allied success in southern France must go
                                impartially to the combined Allied force, and the perfection of
                                execution of the operation from its beginning to the present
                                belong[s] to General Wilson and his Allied staff and to Patch and
                                his subordinate commanders. With the present chaotic conditions of
                                the Germans in southern France, I hope that a junction of the north
                                and south forces may be obtained at a much earlier date than was
                                first anticipated.</p>

                            <p>I am confident from the progress of General Alexander’s offensive
                                from 26th August until the present date that the enemy will be
                                driven completely from the Gothic Line. On the other hand, he is
                                fighting very hard behind its eastern sector and I am not yet in a
                                position to guarantee that this offensive will achieve decisive
                                results. Considering, however, that the enemy has been forced to
                                engage the bulk of his reserves to meet the thrust of the Eighth
                                Army, I feel confident that as a result of the second offensive to
                                be launched very soon by the Fifth Army the destruction of
                                Kesselring’s Army may yet be achieved.</p>
                            <p>Should Kesselring’s Army be so hammered that it is unable to carry
                                out an orderly withdrawal, I consider that with our great
                                superiority in armour there is every chance of achieving really
                                decisive results similar to those which have been secured in
                                France.. On the other hand, if he has time and opportunity to carry
                                out a coordinated demolition programme, and particularly if bad
                                weather should restrict the movement of armoured vehicles off the
                                roads and limit operations of the air force as it may well do, then
                                he may well be able to withdraw a considerable proportion of his
                                forces intact and we may find them facing us behind the Po. Bearing
                                in mind however that he is unlikely to have sufficient troops to
                                hold the Po indefinitely, the course of operations would probably be
                                a gradual withdrawal behind the line of the Alps and the Piave.</p>
                            <p>To sum up, it appears therefore that operations will develop in one
                                of two ways: <list>

                                        it should be possible to undertake a rapid regrouping and a
                                        pursuit towards the Ljubljana Gap and across the Alps
                                        through the Brenner Pass, leaving a small force to clear up
                                        northwest Italy, or,</item>

                                    <item>Kesselring’s Army will succeed in effecting an orderly

                                        we can do more than clear the Lombardy Plains this year.
                                        Difficult terrain and severe weather in the Alps during
                                        winter would prevent another major offensive until spring of
                                        1945.</item>

                            <p>Up to date information goes to show that the enemy is engaged in a
                                large scale withdrawal from the Aegean Islands and from southern
                                Greece with the object of finding mobile forces to hold the
                                Bulgarian frontier and Yugoslavia.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, I anticipate that the enemy will retain static
                                garrisons at important points and airfields with the object of
                                preventing unopposed entry into the Balkans.</p>
                            <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0288"/>
                            <p>It would appear however that owing to the rapid advance of the
                                Russian Army to Turnu Severin, and according to latest reports, the
                                success of air and Partisan attacks on his Balkan communications
                                (mentioned as <gloss target="#t_Ratweek1"><hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >Ratweek</hi></gloss> in part III of <gloss

                                181) is seems to be probable that the enemy will be unable to
                                achieve his purpose, nor will he be able to withdraw any substantial
                                forces to assist him in his battles in Italy or in Central
                                Europe.</p>
                            <p>I therefore consider that we can anticipate a situation in which the
                                bulk of the German forces south of a line Trieste-Ljubljana-Zagreb
                                and the Danube is immobilized and will so remain until their
                                supplies are exhausted in which case they would be ready to
                                surrender to us or will be liquidated by Partisan or Russian
                                forces.</p>
                            <p>As long as the battle in Italy continues, I have no forces to employ
                                in the Balkans except: <list>

                                Alternately should existing conditions in Italy make such a transfer
                                undesirable, in the opinion of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, the
                                Twelfth Air Force will furnish a command and staff echelon to
                                General Devers’ Army Group for the necessary coordination of air
                                operations and for complete air liaison with <gloss

                                be that we shall have to obtain at least 1 more fighter-bomber group

                            <p>4. The exact date when administrative control should pass to me
                                cannot be stated at the present time. Logistical support and

                                        >Dragoon</hi></gloss> forces should continue from the
                                Mediterranean Theater so long as United States supplies are in
                                excess of reserves needed for other United States units in that
                                theater. Thereafter maintenance may continue through southern France
                                ports or be shipped to other routes if the latter prove more
                                advantageous. Close coordination with the Mediterranean Command will
                                be essential while resources are being shipped through the ports of
                                southern France, whether from the United States or from North Africa
                                or a combination of the two. I recommend that the terminating date
                                of this responsibility be arranged by mutual agreement between
                                Generals Wilson and Devers.</p>
                            <p>5. It is suggested that the Combined Chiefs of Staff directive to

                            <p>Today, on D plus 95, almost the whole of northern France has been
                                liberated as have substantial parts of Belgium. Our forces have
                                entered Holland and are close to the German Frontier at more than
                                one point. In Brittany only the Channel Islands, Brest, Lorient and
                                St. Nazaire hold out, and on the channel coast only Le Havre,
                                Boulogne and Calais. The hostile occupation in force of the Dutch
                                Islands at the mouth of the Schelde is certain to delay the
                                utilization of Antwerp as a port and thus will vitally influence the
                                full development of our strategy.</p>
                            <p>In the south of France the Seventh Army in its rapid advance to the
                                north has already reached Besançon and will shortly join forces with
                                the central group of armies.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Enemy resistance</hi>, which has shown signs of
                                collapse during the past few weeks, is stiffening somewhat as we
                                approach the German Frontier. Nevertheless my belief is that the
                                only way he can effectively oppose our advance into Germany will be
                                by reinforcing his retreating forces by divisions from Germany and
                                other fronts and manning the more important sectors of the Siegfried
                                Line with those forces. It is doubtful whether he can do this in
                                time and in sufficient strength but, were he to succeed, he will be
                                likely to concentrate on blocking the two main approaches to
                                Germany, i.e., by way of the Ruhr and the Saar. Of these he will
                                probably regard the approach to the Ruhr as the more important, but
                                in any event he will employ his forces to oppose a deep
                                penetration.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Naval operations</hi> have in general proceeded
                                according to plan, and attempts by the enemy to interfere with our
                                sea lines of communications have been countered effectively.
                                Consequently our losses due to enemy action have been light.
                                However, the unexpected small losses in the assault were largely
                                counterbalanced by the effects of a north easterly gale in June and
                                by the longer shipping turn-round time than had been anticipated.
                                The scale of enemy minelaying and his use of new types of mines have
                                strained our minesweeping resources to the utmost. These factors and
                                systematic demolitions have retarded the development of ports.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">General</hi>. My intention is to press on with all
                                speed to destroy the German armed forces and occupy the heart of
                                Germany. I consider our best opportunity of defeating the enemy in
                                the west lies in striking at the Ruhr and Saar confident that he
                                will concentrate the remainder of his available forces in the
                                defense of these essential areas. The first operation is one to
                                break the Siegfried Line and seize crossings over the Rhine. In
                                doing this the main effort will be on the left. Then we will prepare
                                logistically and otherwise for a deep thrust into Germany. The
                                immediate missions assigned the army groups are set forth below.</p>

                                Central group of armies have therefore been instructed that it is
                                unnecessary to reduce St. Nazaire and Lorient by force of arms and

                                industrial areas, and will have largely destroyed her capacity to
                                wage war whatever course events may take. During the advance to the
                                Ruhr and the Saar we will be opening the deep water ports of Le
                                Havre and Antwerp or Rotterdam which are essential to sustain a
                                power thrust deep into Germany. I wish to retain freedom of action
                                to strike in any direction so far as the logistical situation
                                permits. At the moment and until we have developed the channel ports
                                and the rail lines therefrom, our supply situation is stretched to
                                the breaking point, and from this standpoint the advance across the
                                Siegfried Line involves a gamble which I am prepared to take in
                                order to take full advantage of the present disorganized state of
                                the German armies in the west. The possibilities for further

                            <p>3. The German strategic situation has deteriorated to such a degree
                                that no recovery is now possible. In addition to the disintegration
                                of the German front in the West, the crumbling of the German
                                position in the Balkans, and the penetration of German defenses in
                                Italy, the general decline in Germany’s war potential brought about
                                mainly by Allied bombing and by German losses of manpower has
                                contributed largely to this situation.</p>
                            <p>4. The present German Government, or any Nazi successor, is unlikely
                                to surrender. Control by the Party appears strong enough to prevent
                                governmental overthrow or internal disintegration prior to an
                                extensive collapse of military resistance.</p>
                            <p>5. Although causes for collapse are undoubtedly present, the lack of
                                visible symptoms indicates that German national life is still
                                mobilized behind the war effort. This support is not likely to break
                                down until the final military debacle has reached its final
                                stage.</p>
                            <p>6. The collapse will probably take the form of piecemeal surrenders
                                by field commanders, who will be influenced both by the tactical
                                pressure on them and by their individual appreciation of the
                                hopeless strategic situation, and possibly by their disagreement
                                with the policy of the Central Government.</p>
                            <p>7. Unmistakable signs of the imminence of collapse are unlikely to be
                                apparent until the end of resistance is close at hand, but collapse,
                                once begun, is likely to spread rapidly. We consider that organized
                                resistance under the effective control of the German High Command
                                    (<hi rend="italic">Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</hi>) is unlikely
                                to continue beyond 1 December 1944, and that it may end even
                                sooner.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Ground</hi>. Prior to the opening of the summer
                                offensives, German strategy had as its primary goal the crushing of
                                any Allied attempt to establish a front in western Europe. In order
                                to accomplish this, Germany was prepared to yield ground elsewhere
                                under pressure in the hope that, after defeating Allied operations
                                in the West, she might be able to retrieve such situations as had
                                worsened in the meantime.</p>
                            <p>This strategy failed to produce the desired results. In France the
                                German front has virtually ceased to exist. Since the break through
                                in Normandy, the Germans have been unable to hold any line and the
                                Allies are advancing against very light resistance to the German
                                Frontier. In Italy, the German defenses based on the Gothic position
                                have been penetrated. In the Balkans, the whole German position is
                                crumbling. In the East, although the Germans have, at the moment, an
                                    <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0295"/>organized front between
                                the Russian and the German Frontier, they cannot be confident of

                            <p>The aim of German strategy must be to prolong the war and to prevent,
                                for as long as possible, the invasion of the Reich itself; but the
                                speed of recent events has taken Germany completely by surprise and
                                has left her without the resources and apparently without any
                                coordinated plan to meet her radically altered strategic
                                position.</p>
                            <p>Sound military strategy would long ago have seemed to dictate
                                territorial retrenchment in order to concentrate additional forces
                                in the decisive areas. This, however, would have involved grave
                                political dangers, the very weakness of Germany’s position making it
                                imperative for her to disguise the true state of affairs as long as
                                possible, not only from her enemies, but from the wavering
                                satellites and neutrals, the restive populations in occupied
                                territories, and her own people.</p>
                            <p>We believe that Hitler may now have realized that his only hope of
                                using some of his troops, now in outlying parts of Europe, for the
                                prolongation of the war and the defense of the Reich, lies in with
                                drawing them immediately. There is evidence that this process has
                                already started from the most outlying areas. Even so, he has waited
                                too long. During September he might be able to make available for
                                the defense of the West Wall, in addition to the divisions he is
                                able to extricate from France, the equivalent of 10–15 full
                                divisions from elsewhere, excluding the Eastern Front. These would
                                include some ten low category divisions at present forming in
                                Germany, but they are generally under strength, inadequately
                                trained, short of artillery, and fitted only for static defense, and
                                are considered equivalent to about five full-strength divisions. We
                                are also unable to exclude the possibility that some divisions might
                                even be transferred from the Eastern to the Western Front. Any
                                divisions which Germany can make available will be sent to the West
                                so long as this front presents the most immediate threat. However,
                                if these transfers do take place, they will not be sufficient to
                                hold the Allied attack in the West.</p>

                                Force has declined to negligible proportions. In view of Germany’s

                            <p>In order to provide for the defense of vital strategic objectives in
                                the Reich against Allied bombing operations, the Germans have
                                already found it necessary to curtail drastically air support of
                                their military operations on all fronts and the air defense of
                                occupied territories. Nevertheless, the German Air Force is unable
                                to prevent heavy and systematic destruction of high priority
                                objectives by Allied <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0296"

                                the Reich or exert any important influence on the final outcome of
                                that invasion. Although some temporary increase in fighter strength
                                may be achieved by the avoidance of combat, the shortages of fuel
                                and of trained pilots probably preclude any substantial improvement
                                in defensive capabilities.</p>

                                of this type will become operational before the end of the war to
                                change substantially the present over-all ineffectiveness of the

                                degenerated into harassing activities owing principally to the
                                success of Allied anti-submarine measures and, to some extent, to
                                the impotence of the German Air Force.</p>
                            <p>The enemy still disposes of a large <gloss target="#t_Uboat1"
                                    >U–boat</gloss> fleet and is now constructing improved types. An
                                increase of activity may be expected in the autumn. When these new

                                temporarily meet with more success than has been the case for some
                                months past. Operations will, however, be seriously hampered by the
                                loss of bases in the Biscay and consequently by the disadvantages of
                                being forced to use Norwegian ports. Such operations are, therefore,
                                unlikely to achieve a sufficient degree of success to exert any
                                important influence on the course of the war.</p>

                                bombs and mines may, as in the past, prove of material value to the
                                enemy. The operation of “Small Battle Units,” comprising one-man

                                intensified. It is very unlikely, however, that the enemy will be
                                able by these means to exert any important influence on the course

                                constitutes one of the most critical over-all weaknesses in the
                                German situation. The number of physically fit young men remaining
                                in the entire German population is already substantially less than
                                the minimum requirements of the armed forces. German losses in
                                manpower have already been enormous. These can no longer be replaced
                                nor can the fighting effectiveness <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241"

                                this heavy attrition. Mobilization of the civilian labor forces is
                                already virtually complete and the importation of more foreign
                                workers is not now possible on any substantial scale and would
                                increase the already grave potential source of danger they
                                represent. Announced German measures for “full mobilization” of the
                                home front therefore cannot have any substantial effect in

                                strongest elements in the German strategic situation are the
                                political and psychological forces which maintain the German will to
                                resist in spite of the overwhelming pressure exerted by the adverse
                                military situation. Nazi controls governing every aspect of German
                                life continue to be outwardly effective. As a result of the
                                attempted <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> of 20 July, Nazi
                                control has been further extended into the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Wehrmacht</hi>. Undoubtedly, the extent of the plot, which came
                                to light on 20 July after brewing for months, indicates serious
                                discontent in the armed forces, especially in the officer corps.
                                This discontent is being kept in check only at the expense of
                                further weakening the fighting power of the army through the re
                                placement of disaffected officers by Nazi officers of less ability

                                material with which Germany is at present faced, and seriously
                                reduces her capacity to deal with the catastrophic developments in

                                and the possibility of war weariness or discouragement in one or
                                more of the United Nations. At present the relations of the three
                                major United Nations are more harmonious than ever. Secret weapons
                                cannot, of course, be evaluated precisely in advance, but the
                                overwhelming weight of scientific and military conjecture holds that
                                the Germans are not likely to produce a new weapon that can
                                fundamentally alter the course of the war. The Allied advance in the
                                West has already occupied or cut off all the main areas from which
                                ground-launched flying bombs or long-range rockets can be operated
                                against England and has thus destroyed German hopes of influencing
                                the course of the war by the use of these weapons. War weariness
                                among the United Nations can scarcely be expected to become critical
                                at a time when their military progress is more rapid than in any
                                former period. Thus, the virtual hopelessness of the German
                                situation is driven home more forcefully week by week as the hope of
                                being able to pro long the war recedes.</p>

                                    Resistance</hi></p>
                            <p>The preceding paragraphs indicate that the factors which should
                                produce a collapse or surrender are already present in the German
                                    <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0299"/>situation. Continued
                                German resistance is chiefly due to the fanatical determination of
                                the Nazi Party leaders to fight to the end and to their possession
                                of the necessary political and psychological control within Germany.
                                This determination is based on the doctrine held by the Nazis that
                                Germany surrendered too quickly in 1918; their fear for their own
                                safety; a fanatical belief in their own capabilities which prevents
                                them from accurately appraising the situation; and the lack of any
                                alternative to continued resistance which would seem to offer
                                opportunities for a later revival of their power. It is possible
                                that preparations are being perfected to maintain, even after
                                defeat, an underground organization. The failure of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> of 20 July has given the Party
                                still more complete control of both the home front and the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Wehrmacht</hi>. The civilian population alone has
                                neither the courage nor the capacity to risk revolt, even if it is
                                beginning to appreciate the hopelessness of continued resistance. In
                                the Army, discipline remains reasonably firm although the confidence
                                of the rank and file is being undermined by the shortage of men,
                                munitions, motor transport, and liquid fuels and by the inescapable
                                contrast between German and Allied artillery and air power.
                                Therefore although the strategic situation indicates certain defeat,
                                German resistance is likely to continue beyond the time when any
                                rational objectives within the immediate or distant future seem to
                                be served by doing so.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">3. <hi rend="italic">Symptoms of German Collapse or
                                    Surrender</hi></p>
                            <p>There are still no certain indications that German groups are acting
                                as though collapse or surrender is imminent. Despite the plot of 20
                                July and the fact that the promotion of <gloss target="#t_SS1"
                                    >SS</gloss> officers had a bad effect on the morale of officers
                                of the Army proper, there is no evidence that the officer corps or
                                the rank and file of the Army has been generally and seriously
                                demoralized. Although surrenders are occurring more readily than
                                formerly, large scale mutinies or desertions have not yet developed.
                                In certain areas German soldiers continue to fight tenaciously but
                                elsewhere they have lost the will to resist and only discipline
                                prevents a complete collapse of morale. On the home front, strikes
                                and demonstrations have apparently not yet assumed dangerous
                                proportions. Serious peace feelers have not been put forth by the
                                Germans, but the satellite states, which might be expected to break
                                away from a defeated Germany before final collapse, have already
                                begun to do so.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">4. <hi rend="italic">Form of Surrender</hi></p>
                            <p>Since it is unlikely that the present German Government or any Nazi
                                successor will surrender, the end of German resistance is most
                                likely to come through a series of piecemeal surrenders by German
                                armed forces in the field. Individual commanders who find themselves
                                    <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0300"/>in difficult situations
                                will be influenced to surrender by their own appraisal of the
                                general strategic situation and possibly by their disagreement with
                                the policy of the Central Government. Once the tendency toward
                                piecemeal surrender gathers momentum, elements of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Wehrmacht</hi> which have retreated into Germany
                                under arms may even carry out the actual final expulsion of the Nazi
                                regime. But this possibility cannot be envisaged until one or more
                                of the main fighting fronts has collapsed.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">5. <hi rend="italic">Time of Surrender</hi></p>
                            <p>We believe that organized German resistance under the effective
                                control of the German High Command (<hi rend="italic">Oberkcommando
                                    der Wehrmacht</hi>) is unlikely to continue beyond 1 December
                                1944. In reaching this conclusion we consider the collapse of the
                                German front in the West, the rapid deterioration of the position in
                                the East, especially in the Balkans, the impotence of the German Air
                                Force, and increasing shortages of oil and weapons of war which will
                                have become most critical by that date. The military situation
                                therefore is ripe for a collapse. It is impossible to forecast the
                                date at which this collapse might begin, but once begun it is likely
                                to spread rapidly. We therefore believe that organized resistance
                                may end even sooner than 1 December.</p>

                                    as is possible the support of the further construction of the
                                    Burma Road (which cannot be completely opened until 1946) and of
                                    the pipelines to Yunnan (which are also progressing slowly), in
                                    addition we have of course to defend the frontiers of India. We
                                    are thus committed to a long drawn out struggle in the jungles
                                    and swamps against an enemy who has superior lines of
                                    communication to those which we possess. The wastage from
                                    sickness and disease amounted during the Campaign of 1944 up to
                                    30th June alone to 282,000 in addition to a loss in killed,
                                    wounded and missing of approximately 40,000. Clearly therefore
                                    we should make every effort to liquidate this highly undesirable
                                    commitment if it can by any means be done.</item>

                                    Japanese in North Burma. This, in our opinion, will merely lead
                                    to a continuation of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs

                                    and the maintenance of the expedition by sea. This plan is now
                                    rendered practicable by the large measure of air superiority
                                    which we enjoy in this theatre and by the Japanese inability any
                                    longer to dispute our sea lines of communication to

                                <item>We are now building up a strong fleet in the Bay of Bengal the

                                    required for the operations outlined above in the South East
                                    Asia Theatre. It is our desire in accordance with His Majesty’s
                                    Government’s policy that this fleet should play its full part at
                                    the earliest possible moment in the main operations against
                                    Japan wherever the greatest Naval strength is required, and
                                    thereafter its strength should be built up as rapidly as
                                    possible. This fleet by mid-1945 could probably comprise 4

                                    cruisers, 40–50 Fleet destroyers, 100 escorts and a considerable
                                    Fleet Train, the whole constituting a force which could make a
                                    valuable contribution in the crucial operations leading to the
                                    assault on Japan. This fleet built up as fast as possible would
                                    operate under United States Command.</item>

                                <item>If for any reason United States Chiefs of Staff are unable to
                                    accept the support of a British Fleet in the main operations
                                    (which is our distinct preference), we should be willing to
                                    discuss an alternative. The suggestion that we would make in
                                    this event is the formation of a British Empire Task Force under
                                    a British Commander consisting of British, Australian and New
                                    Zealand land, sea and air forces to operate in the South West
                                    Pacific Theatre under General MacArthur’s Supreme Command. This
                                    alternative if decided upon would still enable the British Fleet
                                    to be well placed to reinforce the U.S. Pacific Fleet if this
                                    should later be desired.</item>

                                with particular reference to French Indochina. The Ambassador stated
                                that the question has become one of considerable urgency since Mr.
                                Eden is anxious to give M. Massigli an answer to two definite points
                                before the latter leaves London on August 29. The two specific
                                questions on which Mr. Eden desires to give M. Massigli an
                                affirmative answer are: (1) the attachment to the South East Asia
                                Command headquarters of a French Military Mission under General
                                Blaizot, and (2) the establishment in India of a “<hi rend="italic"

                                the British Chiefs of Staff had informed him that our military
                                people are in complete accord.</p>
                            <p>I told Lord <gloss target="#t_Halifax1">Halifax</gloss> that I would
                                endeavor to obtain some rapid decision on the question, but that as
                                he knew the matter was one which would involve a decision at a very
                                high level. He said that he was aware of this fact but hoped that a
                                favorable answer can be obtained sometime Monday.<note n="1"

                                            <item>The establishment of a French Military Mission
                                                with South East Asia Command would facilitate the
                                                work of <gloss target="#t_SOE1">SOE</gloss>/<gloss
                                                  target="#t_OSS1">OSS</gloss> and would serve as
                                                the nucleus of the operational headquarters which
                                                may be required later. If the Mission is not
                                                accepted the French will probably concentrate on
                                                Chungking, where it would be harder to control them.
                                                The function of the Mission would be confined mainly
                                                to matters concerning Indo-China and it would not
                                                participate in questions of general strategy. It
                                                would therefore be much on the same basis as the
                                                Dutch and Chinese Missions attached to South East

                                                officials still in Indo-China, but with the
                                                administrative difficulties that would be involved
                                                now, His Majesty’s Government think that the offer
                                                of these forces should only be accepted in the later
                                                stages of the war and on the understanding that they
                                                are made up of good and experienced fighting men.
                                                The French have also proposed the establishment in

                            <p>I believe it desirable to call to your attention that the French
                                request to the British Government was submitted in a note from the
                                Commissariat of Foreign Affairs to the representative of the British
                                Government in Algiers on May 24, an English translation of which was
                                transmitted by the American Ambassador, Mr. Murphy, under date of
                                June 10. The French note does not include the two last mentioned
                                proposals but it does point out that the British <gloss
                                    target="#t_SOE1">S.O.E.</gloss> in the Indies “are already
                                carrying out the instructing and training of a large number of
                                French officers with a view to officering of the light intervention
                                force”.</p>
                            <p>It is, also, to be noted from the attached cable no. 231 from Colombo
                                of July 25<note n="1" xml:id="d156fn1">Not printed (740.0011 <gloss

                                ago the British dropped a de Gaullist agent in Indochina utilizing
                                American facilities in China for the purpose and making efforts to
                                prevent General Chennault from learning the exact nature of the
                                operation; that at a recent staff meeting, <gloss target="#t_SEAC1"
                                    >S.E.A.C.</gloss>, presided over by Lord [Louis] Mountbatten, it
                                was decided to proceed with two additional operations proposed by
                                the British <gloss target="#t_SOE1">S.O.E.</gloss> to drop de
                                Gaullist agents in Indochina by parachute, one of whom is said to
                                carry a holographic letter from de Gaulle; that the American staff
                                officer responsible for coordination of <gloss target="#t_SOE1"
                                    >S.O.E.</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OSS1">O.S.S.</gloss> was
                                not present having been told the meeting was cancelled; that he had
                                been asked his approval in advance but declined as these operations
                                are apt to be of far more political than military importance, and he
                                was unwilling to assume responsibility of approving as an American
                                officer British political policies and programs for Indochina which
                                might not coincide with American policies and programs; that because
                                of the political implications of the operations and the reluctance
                                of American officers to give approval it was decided to seek
                                approval of the American Government through regular diplomatic
                                channels via London; that the British intended, however, to proceed
                                with the first operation planned at the recent meeting even though
                                clearance with the Department could not have been obtained <pb
                                    n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0307"/>through London by then. It
                                is to be noted that American facilities have to be used in all of
                                these operations. To date, there has been no approach to the
                                American Government through diplomatic channels for approval of
                                these operations.</p>
                            <p>A memorandum to you with a proposed memorandum to the President was
                                approved by me on July 27, but was withdrawn when I was advised that
                                the issue raised by the use of American facilities in this manner
                                was being taken up directly with the President by the American
                                military authorities. I have now been informed that the military
                                authorities have decided not to raise the question with the
                                President and this matter presumably has not been brought to his
                                attention.</p>

                                that the American Ambassador has been “informed by usual reliable
                                source that British have approved immediately the sending of a

                                accredited to Lord Mountbatten’s command to discuss questions
                                relating to Indochina and control use of the light intervention
                                force”; that “agreement has supposedly been reached also” between
                                French and the British on the sending of a light intervention force;
                                and that the “question of sending later on a French expeditionary
                                force has not yet been worked out but it is expected that some
                                progress will be made during Massigli’s present trip to London”.</p>

                                to say that he had a copy of the attached letter dated August 29,

                                in which our Joint Chiefs of Staff gave some indication that there
                                was no military objection <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0310"
                                />to acceding to the British request. I informed Mr. Maclean that I
                                had not yet seen the letter; that when I did I would get in touch
                                with Admiral Leahy, but that I did not see how the letter could in
                                any way modify the President’s reply. Upon receiving the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff letter shortly thereafter, I telephoned Admiral
                                Leahy and then informed Mr. Maclean that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                letter to the Secretary of State was merely intended to convey their
                                views on the military aspect of the questions posed and could in no
                                way of course be considered as modifying the position which the
                                President had taken of which I had informed Mr. Wright, namely, that
                                consideration of the question must be deferred until the meeting in

                                Britain and the United States, and few people anywhere who have been

                                remembering that Great Britain has been fighting for five years and
                                that they are at the bottom of the barrel as regards manpower. Men
                                from 16 to 65 are conscripted, and women from 18 to 50. The country
                                has been on short rations for this entire period. I live on them and
                                know what this means. The British Army is older than our Army. The
                                British Navy is older than our Navy. The British merchant seamen are
                                older than our merchant seamen. Only the Royal Air Force <pb n="255"

                                Britain. In the intervening years its continuous operation has done
                                much to save life in the other services, but it has taken a
                                frightful toll of the youth of the country.</p>
                            <p>When the war with Germany is over the war with Japan will begin for
                                Great Britain, in spite of the early defeats at Hong Kong and
                                Singapore, and the fighting in Burma. I have talked about this with
                                many soldiers and sailors and airmen. I knew General Wingate well,
                                and had something to do with his assignment to the Far East. Pie
                                told me once that out of every 100 men they sent him, sixty had to
                                carry forty. That means that you have to have a selective army if
                                you are to fight the Japanese successfully in tropical areas. I have
                                talked with Admiral Cunningham, and he told me that special
                                arrangements should be made for Navy personnel who move to the Far
                                East. Men should have better wages than at present and both
                                soldiers’ and sailors’ families should be given larger family
                                allowances if the wanted men are to continue in active service. The
                                Royal Air Force is better positioned to move eastward but
                                adjustments would also have to be made in that service.</p>
                            <p>The careful planning that General Marshall has made to prepare our
                                armies for the transition period as we move from the western theater
                                eastward, by educational films and in other ways, has no counterpart
                                in the present British thinking. The whole field of psychological
                                preparation for what for them will be the second war has been
                                largely neglected.</p>
                            <p>It has always interested me that the plans for demobilization
                                following the defeat of Germany have been treated with the utmost
                                secrecy for fear of creating misunderstandings in the United States
                                in relation to the serious intentions of Great Britain to fight a
                                war against Japan. And yet there are many people who are now
                                mobilized in the war against Germany who would be utterly useless in
                                fighting a war against Japan. I have never questioned this policy
                                since the President is a friend of Great Britain, and even a
                                sensible demobilization in a presidential compaign might be used
                                against him.</p>
                            <p>All that is one side of the picture. The really gallant people of
                                Great Britain are as anxious to join us in the fight against Japan
                                as we are ourselves to defeat Japan, and yet for all that there has
                                seeped into this country through military channels a belief that the
                                British Navy is not wanted in the Pacific. I know the practical side
                                that many of our Navy men feel that the British Navy was built for
                                short hauls with available ports that ringed the world, and that
                                conversion would mean clogging our navy yards and strengthening the
                                British Navy in the postwar years. There is some truth to it all,
                                and yet if we allow the British to limit their active participation
                                to recapture areas that are <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0312"
                                />to their selfish interests alone and not participate in smashing
                                the war machine of Japan, if British soldiers don’t cross the
                                Atlantic to our ports and entrain for our Pacific ports in order to
                                move against Japan, and if we shuck the British air force in order
                                to prove our own dominance in the air, we will create in the United
                                States a hatred for Great Britain that will make for schisms in the
                                postwar years that will defeat everything that men have died for in
                                this war. Repetition of the tragedy of 1918 will be
                                unforgivable.</p>
                            <p>I have not found more than a dozen Englishmen interested in this
                                problem, and no one from the United States in any way concerned
                                about it.</p>
                            <p>What are you doing about it? I hope the President is interested.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Gil</hi>: I hasten to reply to your
                                    letter<note n="1" xml:id="d161fn1"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra</hi>.</note> relative to the implications of the British
                                participation in the war against Japan. First of all I want to
                                assure you that a number of us are greatly concerned about it and I
                                am very hopeful that the President will land up on the right side of
                                this problem.</p>
                            <p>I am well aware of the attitude in certain circles here, but I am
                                convinced that they are not, in any sense, representative of public
                                opinion. The difficulty, in matters of this kind, is that public
                                opinion gets no opportunity to express itself and, indeed, can know
                                nothing about it until the damage is irrevocable.</p>
                            <p>There, obviously, must be some demobilization of the British Armed
                                Forces after the collapse of Germany, just as I have no doubt there
                                will be some of our own. Ours will be less dramatic and, therefore,
                                will receive far less attention. It will, no doubt, take the form,
                                first, for practical purposes, of Stopping of enlistments and
                                inductions in the Armed Forces, but I have no doubt that hundreds of
                                thousands of men will be quietly separated from the Armed Forces for
                                good and sufficient reasons. It is quite easy to accelerate the
                                discharges either simply by raising the standards as to physical
                                fitness or age. The same will not be true in England. There is no
                                possibility of her transferring the whole of her Armed Force[s]
                                either to the occupation of Germany or for the war against Japan.
                                Such a force as England now has under arms will not be required, but
                                I hope the British will continue their <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257"
                                    facs="0313"/>policy of playing this down for nothing could be
                                worse than to have any public announcement of British plans for
                                demobilization.</p>
                            <p>We simply must find a way to have Great Britain take her full and
                                proper place in the war against Japan. This, with the best goodwill
                                in the world, is full of many difficulties—transportation, supply,
                                etc.</p>
                            <p>You know as well as I that we do not have a chance to get a genuinely
                                good peace unless Russia, Great Britain and the United States can
                                see eye to eye and this means far more than the narrow confines of
                                government in the Foreign Offices. It means, so far as Great Britain
                                and the United States are concerned, that great masses of people
                                must approve our policies. The more I see of the problems and
                                conflicts engendered by the kind of thing that you have written me
                                about, the more I realize how essential it is for us to have men
                                managing our affairs who have a deep and profound conviction not
                                only about world peace and the harnessing of Japan and Germany, but
                                about the bold moves which must be made if a world economy is to be
                                developed which can provide the environment without which our goals
                                can never be attained.</p>
                            <p>In saying all this, I would say that I hope very much that you,
                                personally, are going to remain close to this thing in some capacity
                                or other for the next few years. Needless to say, I believe the
                                President is essential to it and there is little hope of
                                accomplishing much without his re-election. This, I should tell you,
                                I believe will take place, but I am the world’s worst political
                                guesser.</p>
                            <p>As ever, with this note I send my warmest and affectionate
                                regards.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">a</hi>. The intention is to take advantage of the
                                enemy disorganization by pressing as far as possible down the Tiddim
                                Road and the Kabaw Valley and if opportunity offers to secure Kalewa
                                and Kalemyo.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese are unlikely to resist us in strength north of the areas
                                Yazagyo (in the Kabaw Valley) and Tonzang (at Milestone 133 on the
                                Tiddim Road), but may do so there or further south. It is too early
                                to say whether they will. If they do not the present operations
                                should result in the capture of Kalemyo by about mid-November.</p>
                            <p>If, on the other hand, they do, then an airborne operation will be
                                necessary. Conditions in the Kabaw Valley prohibit movement of
                                medium artillery and tanks until the roads are sufficiently dry, and
                                Mawlaik must be secured in due course to remove any threat from that
                                area. Having secured Kalemyo the intervening ground is of such a
                                difficult nature that there may be some delay before we can capture
                                Kalewa. Preparations must therefore be continued for an airborne
                                operation.</p>

                            <p>The French seek restoration of Indochina and have promised some
                                reforms to offset the independence sentiment which exists among the
                                Indochinese and to enlist American support which they presently
                                consider vital. They are fearful of Chinese ambitions. The French
                                and British believe that French participation in the liberation of
                                Indochina will stimulate Free French resistance within the country
                                and thus aid military operations, but the extent and value of such
                                aid is open to question. It is thought that the Japanese may shortly
                                disarm all French troops and take over the country, possibly
                                establishing an independent puppet regime. It seems doubtful if
                                outside assistance could prevent such Japanese action. . . . There
                                is much mutual distrust among the French with whom our people have
                                come in contact. The French divisions in Indochina are considered
                                ineffective.</p>

                                has swung behind restoration of French authority. It is believed
                                that an important factor in the British position is a desire to
                                strengthen their claim for restoration of Hong Kong. In May the
                                French, it is thought at British instigation, requested the British,
                                with Lord [Louis] Mountbatten’s approval, for permission to send a
                                military mission to <gloss target="#t_SEAC1">SEAC</gloss>, a light
                                intervention force to India for subsequent use in Indochina, and,
                                later on, an expeditionary force to Indochina. They have also asked
                                to participate <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0318"/>in planning
                                political warfare in the east and in planning military operations
                                against Japan. The British have indicated they approve of all but
                                the last.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">See <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>Although Indochina is not at present in the <gloss target="#t_SEAC1"
                                    >SEAC</gloss> theater, it is to be noted the British desire that
                                the details of the proposed French political warfare be worked out
                                between <gloss target="#t_SEAC1">SEAC</gloss> and the proposed
                                French military mission. Even prior to May the British <gloss
                                    target="#t_SOE1">SOE</gloss> was training a large number of
                                French officers for officering the light intervention force.
                                Recently, using American facilities and misleading Chennault as to
                                the purpose, the British dropped a de Gaullist agent in Indochina
                                and agreed on two such further operations (one agent carrying a
                                letter of credentials from de Gaulle) despite insistence by American
                                officers attached to <gloss target="#t_SEAC1">SEAC</gloss> that the
                                purpose was primarily political and not military and must be
                                approved in Washington.</p>
                            <p>Reports indicate a British hope to extend the <gloss
                                    target="#t_SEAC1">SEAC</gloss> theater so as to include
                                Indochina, most of the Dutch East Indies, Borneo and Hong Kong.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese are actively backing the Annamite Revolutionary party
                                which seeks Indochinese independence. There are persistent reports
                                that the Chinese hope for political ascendancy in northern
                                Indochina, or at least creation of a free port and release from the
                                economic stranglehold on southeast China which the French formerly
                                exercised through the Yunnan railroad. They are particularly
                                concerned over the danger to Chinese security inherent in French
                                control of the railroad and their inability to defend it. The
                                Chinese have indicated interest regarding the military government to
                                be established in Indochina.</p>
                            <p>It would seem of substantial military importance to secure for the
                                United Nations the good will of the native peoples of southeast Asia
                                among whom, for some years, there has been increasing nationalistic
                                sentiment, and who, for the past three years, have been subjected to
                                intense Japanese propaganda exploiting the old slogan of “Asia for
                                the Asiatics”. In this objective Indochina cannot be considered
                                apart from other countries of southeast Asia.</p>
                            <p>It is suggested that early, dramatic and concerted announcements by
                                the nations concerned making definite commitments as to the future
                                of the regions of southeast Asia would save many American and Allied
                                lives and facilitate military operations. It would be especially
                                helpful if such concerted announcements could include (1) specific
                                dates when independence or complete (dominion) self-government will
                                be accorded, (2) specified steps to be taken to develop native
                                capacity for self-rule, and (3) a pledge of economic autonomy and
                                equality of economic treatment towards other nations. Such
                                announcements might <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0319"/>well be
                                accompanied by a reaffirmation of American determination to grant
                                Philippine independence, a joint commitment to restore the
                                independence of Thailand, and a pledge to establish a regional
                                commission for consultation on social and economic problems in the
                                region, on which all countries and peoples concerned would be
                                invited to have membership. The value of such concerted
                                announcements would be still further enhanced if each of the
                                colonial powers concerned would pledge a formal declaration of
                                trusteeship under an international organization for the period of
                                tutelage, but it might be unwise for the United States to attempt to
                                insist upon such a declaration of trusteeship by one country if
                                similar declarations could not be secured from the others.</p>
                            <p>In addition to their great value as psychological warfare, such
                                announcements would appear to be directly in line with American
                                postwar interests. These areas are sources of products essential to
                                both our wartime and peacetime economy. They are potentially
                                important markets for American exports. They lie athwart the
                                southwestern approaches to the Pacific Ocean and have important
                                bearing on our security and the security of the Philippines. Their
                                economic and political stability will be an important factor in the
                                maintenance of peace in Asia. Emergence of these regions as
                                self-governing countries would appear desirable as soon as they are
                                capable of self-rule, either as independent nations or in close
                                voluntary association with western powers, for example as dominions.
                                Such association might indeed lend them political and economic
                                strength (the weakness of Asiatic powers has long been a cause of
                                war) and help prevent future cleavage along regional or racial
                                lines.</p>
                            <p>Failure of the western powers to recognize the new conditions and
                                forces in southeast Asia and an attempt to reestablish pre-war
                                conditions will almost surely lead to serious social and political
                                conflict, and may lead to ultimate unifying of oriental opposition
                                to the west.</p>
                            <p>A memorandum on British attitudes towards southeast Asia, generally,
                                is attached.</p>
                            <p>Will you advise me if you wish the Department to develop details of
                                policy along the lines indicated in the above suggestions.</p>

                                    report prepared last year by five officers of the Burma
                                    government. It is strongly denied in London which points to the
                                    expectation of eventual dominion status for Burma and British
                                    support of French restoration in Indochina. However, the British
                                    anticipate a fairly extended military occupation of Thailand and
                                    anticipate the need of strong economic control of all these

                                    practices. It seems clear that the British envisage economic

                                            in paragraph 1 of <gloss target="#t_CCS1">C.C.S.</gloss>
                                            417/8, printed here). Marshall explained privately that
                                            this new definition was designed to allow for an
                                            invasion of the Japanese home islands (see Ehrman, p.

                                            July 29, 1944, the British Chiefs of Staff agreed to the
                                            proposed redefinition, subject to certain assurances.
                                            These assurances were given by the United States Chiefs

                                            417/5, August 4, 1944, in the following terms: “The

                            <p>A course of action to follow the Luzon operation, if undertaken, is
                                under study.</p>
                            <p>3. It is believed that operations should be devised to accomplish the
                                defeat of Japan at the earliest possible date and to that end plans
                                will retain flexibility and provision will be made to take full
                                advantage of favorable developments in the strategic situation which
                                may permit taking all manner of short cuts. It is proposed to
                                exploit to the fullest the Allied superiority of naval and air power
                                and to avoid, wherever possible, commitment to costly land
                                campaigns. Unremitting submarine warfare against enemy shipping will
                                be continued. Very long range bomber operations against Japan proper
                                will be continued from China bases and will be instituted from bases
                                being established in the Marianas and from bases to be seized in the
                                future. The air forces in China will continue to support operations
                                of the Chinese ground forces and will also provide the maximum
                                practicable support for the campaign in the Pacific.</p>
                            <p>4. It is agreed that every effort should be made to bring the
                                U.S.S.R. into the war against Japan at the earliest practicable date
                                and planning for such contingency is continuing.</p>

                                “A.”) Japan has sought to enlist the support of her most populous
                                conquered areas by powerful propaganda and by grants of specious
                                independence. For the present, Japan desires to avoid war with the
                                U.S.S.R. in order to be free to direct all her energy against her
                                enemies.</p>
                            <p>As a result of their fundamental beliefs, the morale of the Japanese
                                populace, and especially of the armed forces, has remained
                                relatively high, but a continuing series of sharp defeats will tend
                                further to confuse and bewilder the Japanese. Such defeats, combined
                                with a collapse of Germany, might conceivably cause a reshuffling of
                                the ruling clique followed by an attempt to secure a negotiated
                                peace. Japanese propaganda has already shifted from self-assured
                                offensive to defensive.</p>

                                Production of high-priority armament items such as aircraft may
                                continue to expand for some time, even though the rapid growth of
                                Japan’s basic industry has been levelling off since the beginning of
                                1944. Further substantial growth of the Japanese steel and other
                                basic industries is believed impossible in the light of the present
                                Japanese shipping position. Shipping is now barely adequate to
                                sustain current production rates in the basic industries, and
                                sinkings exceed launchings. The largest and most essential economic
                                commitment for shipping is within the Inner Zone.<note n="*"

                                dependent on the Outer Zone for oil. Inner Zone production and
                                stockpiles of fuel oil are at best estimated as sufficient for about
                                nine months but may be much less. In other essential raw materials

                                with respect to food and is generally bad and deteriorating with

                                Realizing that the war potential of her enemies is increasing much
                                more rapidly than her own, Japan has been compelled to adopt the
                                strategic defensive. She hopes that tenacious resistance along
                                successive lines of defense may eventually result in war weariness
                                and possible division among the United Nations, which would enable
                                her to conclude a satisfactory peace. In the past year her air force
                                has deteriorated in quality of personnel and has operated less
                                aggressively; her navy has suffered serious losses; only her ground
                                forces have maintained their strength and fighting qualities.</p>
                            <p>Although Japan will continue to use caution in the employment of her
                                air power and especially her battle fleet, we believe, nevertheless,
                                that Japan now intends to make vigorous efforts to resist any Allied
                                penetration of her inner defense line Japan–Formosa–Luzon–Mindanao.
                                Her ground forces will offer maximum resistance at all points with
                                little regard for losses; her air power will be committed to a scale
                                of defense proportionate to the strategic importance of each area,
                                and her battle fleet will attack should local circumstances develop
                                which seem to offer opportunity for an effective blow.</p>

                                forces will resist to the maximum extent of their capabilities, but
                                without strong naval and air support.</p>

                                        Japanese, traditionally, are an intensely nationalistic and
                                        close knit family whose broad characteristics are a
                                        toughness of fiber and a fatalistic singleness of purpose.
                                        They have been taught that they are of divine origin, that
                                        the Emperor is directly descended from the god-founder of
                                        the nation and that the Japanese are divinely and infallibly
                                        guided towards the establishment of a new world order. The
                                        Japanese soldier is taught to give blind obedience and to
                                        regard death in the service of the Emperor as an honor. He
                                        is told that he is invincible and that to show weakness or
                                        to surrender is to accept disgrace.</item>

                                <p>As a result of these teachings, the morale of the Japanese
                                    populace, and especially of the armed forces, has remained high,
                                    but the unfavorable course of the war has caused some
                                    disillusionment. Moreover, since much of popular morale is based
                                    upon the theory of invincibility, a series of sharp defeats, as
                                    they are brought home to them, will tend further to confuse and
                                    bewilder the people as a whole.</p>
                                <p>Real power in Japan rests in the hands of small groups of leaders
                                    capable of exploiting the position of the Emperor. The collapse
                                    of Germany will have a tremendously depressing effect upon such
                                    leaders. This, combined with ever increasing United Nations
                                    pressure and approach to the homeland, might conceivably bring
                                    about a reshuffle of the ruling cliques followed by an attempt
                                    to secure a negotiated peace.</p>
                                <p>Official propaganda on the home front has lost its self-assured
                                    tone and determination to fight for existence is replacing
                                    exaltation in victory. The potential of the United Nations is
                                    admitted to be high, and the government has announced its
                                    intention to prepare for the defense of the homeland. Japanese
                                    withdrawals are admitted. It is implied that the Japanese have
                                    finished winning independence for other Asiatic countries and
                                    now must prepare to defend their own islands from frontal
                                    attack. The government is also preparing the Japanese people for
                                    more serious German reverses in Europe.</p>

                                    to increase production of certain high priority armament items,
                                    e.g., aircraft, the expansion of her basic industry, which had
                                    ceased by the end of 1943, almost certainly cannot be resumed
                                    during this war. Lack of shipping is the most important limiting
                                    factor on the expansion of basic industry. Japan still depends
                                    on the Outer Zone for certain essential raw materials,
                                    especially oil. The Japanese have partially succeeded in
                                    reducing this dependence by stockpiling materials in the Inner
                                    Zone where nearly all Japanese industry is concentrated. The
                                    stockpiling program has fallen short because of lack of
                                    shipping.</p>
                                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Shipping</hi>. Japan’s shipping position is
                                    her most critical weakness and is deteriorating rapidly. We
                                    estimate that Japan now has much less shipping than she needs to
                                    carry out military commitments and at the same time to utilize
                                    her industrial capacity to the full. This condition will grow
                                    progressively worse. We believe, however, that Japan will not
                                    voluntarily abandon any strategic outpost because of a shipping
                                    stringency alone, but will accept a curtailment in her basic
                                    over-all industrial production by reducing the import of raw
                                    materials. Should the sinking rate increase, as it has increased
                                    in recent months, the Japanese would be forced to accept this
                                    import reduction proportionately sooner. Sufficient shipping
                                    should be available, if necessary, by diversion from trade, for
                                    essential troop movements.</p>
                                <p>We estimate that Japan will be unable to build more than 800,000
                                    gross tons of steel merchant vessels in 1944, which is far
                                    behind the rate required to replace losses, and that her ship
                                    repair facilities are heavily overburdened. Great emphasis has
                                    been placed on wooden shipbuilding, but this program is not
                                    believed to be progressing as well as planned and could not, in
                                    any event, offset the discrepancy between losses and
                                    construction of steel ships. Japan’s shipping position would be
                                    relatively easier were she cut off from the Outer Zone.</p>
                                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Petroleum and other raw materials</hi>. In
                                    general, Japan’s industrial machine is dependent upon raw
                                    materials which must come from outside Japan Proper and thus the
                                    continuance of supply depends upon transportation. The most
                                    essential raw material contribution from the Outer Zone is oil.
                                    Other critical materials which Japan obtains from the Outer Zone
                                    include nickel, chrome, iron ore, manganese, lead, copper, zinc,
                                    bauxite and phosphates. Her dependence on the Outer Zone for
                                    these materials is however less than in the case of oil either
                                    because of the existence of relatively large stockpiles or the
                                    possibility in some cases of increasing Inner Zone supplies or
                                    of substituting other materials.</p>
                                <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0328"/>
                                <p>Among <hi rend="italic">petroleum products</hi>, Japan’s position
                                    is weakest in fuel oil. Inner Zone production and stocks are
                                    believed sufficient for about nine months and estimated present
                                    over-all production roughly balances consumption at the present
                                    calculated scale. Furthermore, about 75 percent of production is
                                    in the East Indies. Japan is developing new synthetic facilities
                                    in the Inner Zone, but present fuel oil output there would, we
                                    estimate, operate her naval fleet and merchant marine at less
                                    than one-third their present rate of activity, if stocks are not
                                    drawn upon. In aviation gasoline, Japan is similarly dependent
                                    upon the East Indies, 80 percent coining from there, but stocks,
                                    chiefly in the Inner Zone, are believed sufficient for somewhat
                                    more than a year at the present rate of consumption.</p>
                                <p>Japan’s <hi rend="italic">tanker fleet</hi> has been reduced far
                                    below the minimum tonnage required to move fuel oil and aviation
                                    gas out of the East Indies to all consumption centers, and the
                                    deficit has been only partially offset by diversion of dry cargo
                                    vessels to oil-carrying. We believe that Japan will continue
                                    this diversion at the expense of other cargoes in order to keep
                                    the oil line full and moving.</p>
                                <p>Although about 20 percent of Japan’s <hi rend="italic">iron
                                        ore</hi> is now derived from Outer Zone areas, we believe
                                    that Inner Zone production, most of which is outside Japan
                                    Proper, could fill all essential needs. Nearly all of Japan’s
                                        <hi rend="italic">coal</hi> supply is in the Inner Zone, but
                                    more than 50 percent of it lies outside of Japan Proper. Thus
                                    iron ore and coal constitute the greatest burden of Japanese
                                    shipping. Japan is almost completely dependent on north China
                                    and Manchuria for coking coal since the supplies available to
                                    her elsewhere are generally of too poor quality to make high
                                    grade coke without the admixture of the coal from north
                                    China.</p>
                                <p>Stockpiles of <hi rend="italic">bauxite</hi> and the possibility
                                    of producing alumina from inferior ores in the Inner Zone reduce
                                    Japan’s dependence on bauxite supplies from Bintan Island
                                    (Malaya) and Indochina. Though Japan’s <hi rend="italic"

                                    more than half her requirements at home. The <hi rend="italic"
                                        >lead</hi> stockpile, supplemented by Inner Zone production,
                                    would last at least a year. Japan’s <hi rend="italic">zinc</hi>
                                    position is more stringent; the Inner Zone produces not more
                                    than two-thirds of Japan’s requirements and stocks are believed
                                    to be low.</p>
                                <p>Japan’s major source of <hi rend="italic">nickel</hi> is Celebes
                                    and if this source were cut off her position would be difficult.
                                    A conservative use pattern probably has been observed, however,
                                    and we believe that the full effects would not be felt in less
                                    than a year. The first results of a sharp reduction in use of
                                    nickel would be impairment of the quality of war material.</p>
                                <p>In <hi rend="italic">chromium</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                        >manganese</hi>, Japan’s position is believed to be somewhat
                                    better. For both, Inner Zone production, plus stocks, is
                                    believed sufficient for more than a year’s consumption. The

                                    major source of both, contributing a large portion of new
                                    chromium and nearly 40 percent of the new manganese.</p>

                                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi>. Japanese industrial
                                    production expanded generally up to the beginning of 1944, when
                                    it levelled off because of basically restrictive factors (e.g.,
                                    lack of shipping) which the Japanese are not expected to
                                    overcome during this war. However, production of certain high
                                    priority finished products, such as aircraft, continues to
                                    increase. Japan will attempt to increase the production of such
                                    instruments as fire control gear, radar, and other types of
                                    precision electrical equipment, but because of technical and
                                    organizational difficulties, we believe that she will not be
                                    able to accomplish any great expansion in this field. There is
                                    still a slight cushion in consumer and civilian goods which can
                                    be sacrificed in all out efforts to increase the production of
                                    military armaments. Japanese industry is almost wholly
                                    concentrated in Inner Zone areas (southern Hokkaido, central
                                    Honshu, northern Kyushu, northern Korea, southern Manchuria and
                                    Formosa). Finished munitions production is heavily concentrated
                                    in Honshu, although Manchurian industry, with help from Japan
                                    Proper, largely supports the Japanese Army in Manchuria.</p>
                                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Food</hi>. The 1944 rice consumption in the
                                    Inner Zone is higher than anticipated because of reduced wheat
                                    and barley crops. For this and other reasons, we now believe
                                    that Japanese rice reserves are uncomfortably low and that Japan
                                    must next year depend upon shipments from Indochina and Thailand
                                    for an essential portion of rice supplies. Food rations can be
                                    reduced without causing actual starvation or serious political
                                    consequences, but any reduction will result in decreased
                                    industrial efficiency and further deterioration of public
                                    health.</p>

                                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">General</hi>. The rapid build-up and advance
                                    of Allied forces in the Central and South Pacific have brought
                                    home to Japan the realization that she must prepare to meet
                                    steadily increasing Allied strength. In addition, Japan’s
                                    relations with the U.S.S.R. are uneasy because of the ever
                                    present fear that one day that country may join the forces
                                    arrayed against her. Forced to accept the strategic defensive,
                                    Japan <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0330"/>is attempting to
                                    consolidate and make secure her greatly expanded empire. She is
                                    developing successive defense lines to hold off her enemies in
                                    the hope that they, wearied by the war in Europe and perhaps
                                    divided among themselves, will attack her ineffectively or
                                    compromise to her advantage.</p>
                                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Air forces</hi>. The Japanese Air Force
                                    finds itself totally unable to match the constantly growing
                                    strength of our opposing air forces and is irrevocably committed
                                    to a strategic defensive role. Strictly offensive operations
                                    have become progressively more limited in scope and less
                                    frequent. Meanwhile, the highest priority is being given to
                                    aircraft production, and latest estimates suggest that at least
                                    1200 combat aircraft are now being produced each month. A
                                    strenuous effort is being made to overcome qualitative
                                    inferiority by better protective armament, greater fire power,
                                    self-sealing fuel tanks, and engines of increased power. Already
                                    there has been a marked improvement in the quality of Japanese
                                    fighter aircraft. All available indications show that the combat
                                    efficiency of the Japanese Air Force is at present suffering
                                    seriously from a shortage of fully trained and experienced
                                    pilots and crews. Currently expanded facilities for individual
                                    and group training are being completed, but in periods of high
                                    attrition the Japanese will find it difficult to provide
                                    replacement of effectively trained personnel. We believe that a
                                    combination of difficulties will make it impossible for Japan’s
                                    air forces to improve materially their present qualitative
                                    inferiority so long as continued and heavy pressure is brought
                                    against her.</p>
                                <p>Although the Allies will probably meet increasingly strong
                                    numerical air resistance as they attack successive lines of
                                    defense, the scale and duration encountered at each point of
                                    attack is likely to be conditioned by Japan’s intention to
                                    preserve air strength for the final defense of those areas which
                                    she considers vital to the defense of the homeland and its
                                    critical supply lines.</p>
                                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Naval forces</hi>. Japan’s naval strength is
                                    inadequate for the defense of her outer perimeter. She is only
                                    able to concentrate portions of her fleet at a few strategic
                                    bases to parry thrusts at key points of her defense line. Allied
                                    strength is denying the Japanese Fleet the use of all but a
                                    small part of the Pacific Ocean. With her present relatively
                                    small operational fleet, Japan does not dare risk possible heavy
                                    attrition by launching any major offensives. Although she is
                                    striving to increase her fleet strength by new units, the
                                    appearance of such new ships has been so rare as to suggest
                                    difficulties in the outfitting of such forces. We believe that
                                    Japan is primarily engaged in building small escort vessels to
                                    counter the heavy toll of merchant ships taken by our
                                    submarines.</p>
                                <p>We believe that in the future the Japanese will deploy their
                                    fleet so as to be able better to meet readily the next estimated
                                    Allied blow. <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0331"/>With their
                                    fleet concentrated in the Celebes Sea the Japanese had hoped to
                                    counter vigorously Allied thrusts at the Philippines. Subsequent
                                    to the battle of the eastern Philippines the main elements of
                                    the fleet were obliged to retire for reequipping and
                                    reorganization. As a result of the threat to the Bonins and the
                                    homeland, developed by our advance to the Marianas, the Japanese
                                    are likely to dispose their heavy surface units along the
                                    Kyushu–Formosa line. However, the fuel oil situation, the
                                    shipping stringency and Allied air power will have a bearing on
                                    ultimate fleet deployment.</p>
                                <p>While the Japanese Fleet suffered a heavy loss of aircraft and
                                    some carrier units in the recent battle of the eastern
                                    Philippines, Japan still retains a battle fleet of considerable
                                    power. Despite recent actions we believe that while the Japanese
                                    High Command will be cautious in the use of their battle fleet,
                                    they will continue to make vigorous efforts to oppose any Allied
                                    penetrations of the line Japan–Formosa–Luzon–Mindanao. The main
                                    considerations governing the strength, disposition, and
                                    employment of Japanese naval units opposing our advance are:
                                    local control of the air, strength of Allied forces, and the
                                    time factor. If, at any time, the Japanese should gain local
                                    control of the air, which is unlikely, we must expect heavy
                                    attacks upon our units by task forces composed of carriers,
                                    battleships, cruisers, etc. Lacking such air control or strong
                                    land-based air cover, the Japanese would use some carriers to
                                    attempt attacks on our flanks, and also light task forces might
                                    attempt night surface torpedo attacks. We can expect the
                                    Japanese to be cautious in all-out attacks on a vastly superior
                                    force, such attacks only materializing if local control of the
                                    air has been established. The element of timing will be affected
                                    by the rapidity with which the High Command reaches the
                                    conclusion that an actual occupation is threatened. In any
                                    event, our carriers will be the primary target for enemy
                                    aircraft, with our transports as secondary. Our transports will
                                    be the primary target for enemy surface forces, with our own
                                    striking forces as secondary.</p>
                                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Ground forces</hi>. Japan’s greatest armed
                                    strength lies in her large, fairly equipped and very well
                                    trained army. Because of the nature of the war in the Pacific to
                                    date, the United Nations have been unable to inflict any serious
                                    attrition on the over-all strength of the Japanese ground
                                    forces, which are as strong or stronger than in 1941.</p>
                                <p>At the present time the Japanese army ground forces total
                                    approximately 3,500,000 men. These troops are organized into
                                    about 85 divisions plus many independent units and garrisons,
                                    which have been so deployed that Japan now maintains a strong
                                    strategically defensive position. In addition, Japan has
                                    organized in Manchuria and China puppet units totaling
                                    approximately 300,000 and 400,000 men respectively. The
                                    strongest concentrations of forces are in Japan Proper,
                                    Manchuria and China. Since United Nations forces have <pb
                                        n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0332"/>begun to threaten
                                    seriously Japan’s position in the Central and Southwestern
                                    Pacific areas, Japan has accelerated her preparations for the
                                    defense of the vital East Indies and has reinforced her southern
                                    forces, particularly in the Philippines area.</p>
                                <p>The formation of puppet units has been general throughout
                                    Japanese occupied territory, but only on a large scale in
                                    Manchuria and China. Puppet troops in other areas have been
                                    formed primarily for purposes of political propaganda, and their
                                    military value to Japan has been negligible. The actual value of
                                    the Manchurian and Chinese puppet troops to Japan cannot be
                                    accurately assessed. They are only lightly equipped and,
                                    although some have been used in combat against the Chinese, the
                                    majority of them have had relatively little training. They are
                                    at present being used mainly as garrison units and for the
                                    maintenance of order in Japanese occupied territory. Because
                                    their loyalty is doubtful, it is unlikely that the Japanese
                                    would use them in a major engagement against well trained and
                                    equipped troops.</p>
                                <p>We believe that Japan intends to maintain generally the present
                                    strategic disposition of her ground forces after further
                                    substantial reinforcement of Formosa and the Philippines.</p>

                                    to Japan, we may expect to find an increasingly large percentage
                                    of Japan’s heavy naval forces based in contiguous waters to
                                    protect the home islands and the essential transport routes
                                    between the home islands and the rest of the Inner Zone.
                                    Similarly, a large percentage of Japan’s total combat aircraft,
                                    particularly fighters, will be kept at bases in the homeland to
                                    protect against bombing of the concentrations of Japanese
                                    armaments production there. Also the formation of new divisions
                                    will be expedited and Japanese home defenses strengthened.</p>
                                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Northern Pacific</hi>. In view of the
                                    American position in the Aleutian Islands and the possibility of
                                    eventual Allied air and naval action from Soviet bases in
                                    Kamchatka and Soviet Sakhalin, Japan will continue her present
                                    policy of strengthening her defenses in the Kuriles and Japanese
                                    Sakhalin.</p>
                                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Manchuria</hi>. Japan has built up in
                                    Manchuria a large and highly developed army. It is largely
                                    sustained by Manchurian agricultural and industrial production,
                                    which is developing more rapidly than any other section of the
                                    Japanese Empire. The purpose of this army is to provide a force
                                    of sufficient strength to protect Manchuria from any Soviet
                                    threat and also to provide a striking force powerful enough to
                                    attack Siberia and the Maritime Provinces should Japan consider
                                    the <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0333"/>latter course to be
                                    necessary. The Japanese High Command has abandoned hope of any
                                    German victory. Japan must appreciate that following peace with
                                    Germany, Soviet military capabilities in the Far East will
                                    increase progressively and, in fact, the initiative along the
                                    Manchurian border will eventually pass to the U.S.S.R. In view
                                    of the Soviet threat, Japan is unlikely to release any
                                    appreciable forces from Manchuria unless they can be quickly
                                    restored. She will continue to maintain a strong defensive
                                    position there, but is unlikely to undertake any offensive
                                    action unless she becomes convinced that the U.S.S.R. is about
                                    to enter the war against her.</p>
                                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">China</hi>. Allied air action from China is
                                    increasingly menacing Japan’s present economic and defensive
                                    position, and the Japanese are taking stronger counter measures
                                    by the occupation and neutralization of some of the more
                                    accessible Allied bases.</p>
                                <p>The Japanese have now completed military operations between the
                                    Yangtze and Yellow Rivers and are in process of consolidating
                                    their position in this newly captured territory while
                                    reconstructing the railroad line linking Hankow with Peking. The
                                    primary objective of current operations south of the Yangtze is
                                    to deny to the Allies air bases in southeastern China. In order
                                    to accomplish this we believe that they intend to occupy the
                                    railway line between Hengyang and Kweilin and also eventually to
                                    establish overland communications between their forces in
                                    central and south China by occupation of the railroad line
                                    between Hengyang and Canton.</p>
                                <p>The Japanese have the capability of successfully carrying out
                                    these intentions. Whether or not they will commit sufficient
                                    forces for the final completion of such operations may however
                                    be influenced by the rapidly increasing threat from the Pacific.
                                    We believe that the Japanese do not intend to weaken the ground
                                    forces they now have based in China unless in due course some of
                                    these divisions are urgently required for the defense of Japan
                                    Proper or Formosa.</p>
                                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Burma</hi>. The main object of Japanese
                                    operations in Burma will be to contain large Allied forces in
                                    terrain favorable to the Japanese and to prevent the reopening
                                    of the land route to China. The Japanese will, when possible,
                                    continue to undertake limited offensive action designed to break
                                    up Allied offensive preparations and to divert as large a part
                                    as possible of the forces of the Southeast Asia Command.</p>
                                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Malaya–Sumatra</hi>. This area is of great
                                    importance to the Japanese, both for its own resources and as a
                                    barrier on the approaches to the South China Sea from the west
                                    and south. The Japanese, however, presumably consider their
                                    present strength there adequate to meet any threat likely to
                                    arise during 1944. In view of their preoccupation with more
                                    immediate threats to Japan Proper, Formosa, and the Philippines
                                    from the Pacific and by air from China, as well as the <pb

                                    Siberia, we anticipate no substantial reinforcement of
                                    Malaya–Sumatra until a threat to that area is more clearly
                                    apparent, and then only as may be warranted by the then existing
                                    over-all situation.</p>
                                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">East Indies</hi>. We believe that Japan will
                                    not in any circumstances voluntarily relinquish her hold upon
                                    the East Indies, but will continue to maintain in the area the
                                    strong ground forces which already have been deployed for their
                                    defense. Although the Japanese in due time will appreciate that
                                    their sea communications to the Indies may be severed, they will
                                    consider the continued denial of the area to the United Nations
                                    forces as of such strategic importance as to warrant the
                                    sacrifice of forces stationed there.</p>
                                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Formosa–Luzon–Mindanao</hi>. Currently the
                                    Japanese are engaged in strenuous efforts to reinforce and build
                                    up ground, air and naval defenses in these areas. Allied attack
                                    upon any part of the line will be fiercely resisted by all
                                    forces immediately available, the scale and intensity of such
                                    resistance progressively increasing from the southern to the
                                    northern part of this strong eastern defense to the vital line
                                    of sea communications with the East Indies. Although Allied
                                    occupation of Mindanao would greatly increase the threat to
                                    Japan’s position, the occupation of Luzon would make the passage
                                    of shipping through the South China Sea highly precarious, while
                                    the capture of Formosa would substantially sever all sea
                                    communications to the south and in addition offer a strong base
                                    for direct assault upon Japan Proper. We believe that the
                                    Japanese intend to have deployed in the immediate future all
                                    forces which they consider can be spared for the defense of the
                                    southern Philippines, whereas land and air strength in Luzon and
                                    Formosa will continue to build up at an accelerated rate should
                                    the Allies occupy the Palaus.</p>
                                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Central Pacific</hi>. In the Bonins, at
                                    Palau, and at Halmahera local Japanese ground forces will resist
                                    to the maximum extent of their capabilities, but without strong
                                    naval and air support. The scale of naval resistance will be
                                    governed by the number of their own land-based aircraft
                                    immediately available, the strength and dispositions of our own
                                    forces, and the time at which they determine that further
                                    occupation is threatened.</p>

                            inviting him to an August conference in Scotland similar to the one at
                            Teheran but unfortunately Stalin replied that military duties would

                        <p>From 18 August, when the President told his press conference that he
                            expected to see the Prime Minister soon, the press speculated on a place
                            and time for the conference. Although one “usually reliable” source on
                            23 August expected the President to view an Allied military parade in
                            Paris, most correspondents were more cautious in their predictions and
                            by the first of September they had agreed that the meeting would take
                            place in Canada. Speculation then turned to the agenda; correspondents
                            wrote that control of Germany and defeat of Japan—obvious topics—would
                            be the principal items of discussion. The fog of public ignorance was
                            cleared on 11 September when the President and Prime Minister Churchill
                            arrived in Quebec and their spokesmen announced that they were there to
                            plan the knockout blow against Japan.</p>
                        <p>When the President and the Prime Minister joined with their staffs in
                            discussion at Quebec, Allied fortunes of war were favorable in all
                            theatres except the Chinese. American, British and Canadian armies had
                            made a lightning sweep across northern France; on the first day of the
                            conference elements of the Third U.S. Army driving east were joined by
                            units of the Seventh U.S. Army pushing north and General Eisenhower then
                            had an unbroken front from Holland to the Mediterranean. On the same day
                            troops of the First U.S. Army entered Germany in force at three points.
                            German strategy in the West had been a strategy of delay, buying time to
                            strengthen the West Wall. The German High Command had made the grave
                            mistake of leaving 200,000 men in the ports of Brest, Le Havre,
                            Boulogne, Calais and Dunkerque. By denying those ports to the Allied
                            Expeditionary Force the Germans had sought to restrict the Allies to the
                            coast but they had greatly underestimated Allied logistic ability and
                            Herr Hitler now found the <gloss target="#t_AEF1">AEF</gloss> probing
                            the West Wall long before his army was sheltered behind it.</p>
                        <p>In Italy General Alexander’s armies were cracking the eastern end of the
                            Gothic Line, from Pisa to Rimini, which the Germans had been striving to
                            hold. Foul weather and tough resistance had made Allied advances slow
                            and expensive for several weeks but by mid-September there was promise
                            of better progress.</p>
                        <p>In the East, Soviet armies had launched a great drive in June on their
                            central front which had carried them to the gates of Warsaw before they
                            were halted by bitter German opposition. Now the Soviets were clearing
                            their southern flank. Rumania dropped out of the war on 23 August, the
                            Red Army was driving into Transylvania, and in the week preceding the
                            Quebec Conference Soviet forces over-ran Bulgaria which capitulated
                            promptly and declared war on its old ally Germany. The rest of the
                            Balkan Peninsula was in turmoil as Partisans, Chetniks, Bulgars and
                            Germans fought each other in Yugo-<pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282"

                            against Mindanao in the Philippines on 9 September as a promise of
                            heavier attacks soon to follow, and simultaneous land-based attacks
                            throughout the Philippine Area encountered amazingly little opposition
                            and revealed unsuspected weakness in the Japanese garrisons. In Burma
                            the Japanese were withdrawing southward, a move which gave promise of an
                            early opening of the Ledo Road, but in China the situation was grave as
                            new enemy drives forced the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force to retreat from
                            its forward bases and threatened to cut off the last stretch of coast
                            from the interior. Japanese drives also endangered the new Very Long
                            Range Bomber bases; the largest strike ever made by <gloss

                            mills at Anshan, Manchuria, on 8 September was followed immediately by
                            the first enemy offensive effort against their bases in the Chengtu
                            area.</p>
                        <p>With China the only dark spot in a worldwide scene of successful Allied
                            drives, with great victories to their credit and the promise of greater
                            ones to come, the President and the Prime Minister convened their
                            Eleventh War Conference to discuss two great problems: postwar control
                            of Germany and the final defeat of Japan.</p>

                        <p>The President left the White House at 10:10 p.m. for his special train
                            which was awaiting him at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
                            “station”. Accompanying the President were the Honorable Henry
                            Morgenthau, Jr., Secretary of the Treasury; Admiral William D. Leahy,
                            U.S.N., Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy;

                            Tully’s assistant. The President and accompanying party arrived at the
                            train at 10:25 p.m. and entrained at once. At 10:27 p.m. this section of
                            the train departed from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and joined
                            up with the first section of the train at 10:47 p.m. The first section
                            had departed from the railroad yards outside the “Bureau” at 10:15 p.m.,
                            so as to be in the proper position on time. The combined special train,
                            operating as “Main 88205”, departed from the Virginia Avenue Station,
                            Washington, at 10:50 p.m. for Highland, N.Y., and our ultimate
                            destination of Quebec, Province of Quebec, Canada. At Quebec the
                            President was scheduled to begin a series of conferences on Monday,

                        <p>We arrived at Highland at 7:30 a.m., after an uneventful trip up from
                            Washington. The weather at Highland was sunny and cool. Mrs. Roosevelt
                            had driven down from Hyde Park to meet the President and came aboard the
                            President’s private car at 8:15 a.m. At 8:30 a.m., the President, Mrs.
                            Roosevelt, Admiral Leahy, Admiral Mclntire, Admiral Brown, General
                            Watson and Secretary Early left the train by motor car for the
                            President’s home at Hyde Park where they spent the day. Secretary
                            Morgenthau left the train at the same time for his estate also nearby.
                            He did not accompany us beyond Highland. Miss Tully and Mrs. Brady
                            remained aboard the train during the day.</p>
                        <p>The President and Mrs. Roosevelt and their party had breakfast at the
                            “Big House” at Hyde Park. After breakfast the President spent the
                            greater part of the morning in his study. Later he, Mrs. Roosevelt,
                            Admirals Leahy, Mclntire, Brown, General Watson, Secretary Early, Miss
                            Malvina Thompson (Mrs. Roosevelt’s Personal Secretary) and Miss Margaret
                            Suckley (Librarian at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library) motored to
                            “Hilltop Cottage” where they enjoyed a picnic lunch. After lunch the
                            party returned to Hyde Park and the President spent most of the
                            afternoon at the Library while the others of the party relaxed and
                            rested about the house.</p>
                        <p>At 4:00 p.m., the President, Mrs. Roosevelt, Admiral Leahy, Admiral
                            Mclntire, Admiral Brown, General Watson, Secretary Early and Miss
                            Thompson left Hyde Park by automobile for Highland to entrain for
                            Quebec. The party arrived at the train which had been returned from
                            Kingston where it was serviced, at 4:30 p.m., entrained at once, and at
                            4:37 p.m. we departed Highland for Albany and Quebec. Mrs. Roosevelt and
                            Miss Thompson joined our party at Hyde Park and accompanied the
                            President to Quebec.</p>

                            been planned. It was moved up in order to ensure the President’s arrival
                            at Quebec before Prime Minister and Mrs. Churchill arrived there. We
                            received word this afternoon that the Prime Minister and his party had

                        <p>The trip north was uneventful. We crossed the International Border into

                        <p>Our train arrived at Quebec—at the Wolfe’s Cove station which is on the

                            a.m. Our train was placed in position for our detraining at once but our

                            King standing nearby, when Prime Minister Churchill’s train pulled up
                            alongside our train at Wolfe’s Cove at exactly 10:00 a.m. Prime Minister
                            King went aboard the train to welcome Prime Minister Churchill and a few

                            Churchill in the second; and Prime Ministers Churchill and King were

                        <p>The President and Prime Minister Churchill arrived at the Citadel at
                            10:25 a.m. Here the President was officially received in Canada. A
                            composite guard of honor of approximately one hundred and fifty men,
                            made up of equal detachments of Royal Canadian Navy, Army and Air Force
                            personnel, was drawn up on the parade ground. This guard was under the
                            command of Lieutenant J. C. Eastman, <gloss target="#t_RCNVR1"

                            Edwin Belanger, played our national anthem, the guard of honor presented
                            arms and our colors were hoisted at the Citadel alongside the British
                            and Canadian colors. No honors were rendered the Prime Minister at this
                            time. On completion of honors for the President, the Prime Minister got
                            out of his car, walked over to the President’s car and the officer in
                            charge of the guard—Lieutenant Eastman—was called up and presented to
                            the President and to the Prime Minister. News photographers and members
                            of the press—some one hundred strong—were present for the ceremonies at
                            the Citadel.</p>
                        <p>From the parade ground the President went directly to the
                            Governor-General’s summer residence within the Citadel grounds. Here he
                            left his automobile and entered the house. The Prime Minister, Mrs.

                            groups who were remaining at the Citadel left their cars at the parade
                            ground and walked to the nearby residence of the Governor-General. Other

                            and Princess Alice. The Citadel was guarded by its regular garrison
                            augmented by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and our Secret Service men.
                            The special anti-aircraft protection afforded last year was not provided
                            as it was not considered necessary this year.</p>
                        <p>The President had been preceded to Quebec by the other members of our
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff—General George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the
                            Army; Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet and Chief
                            of Naval Operations; General Henry H. Arnold, Commanding General, Army
                            Air Forces; Brigadier General Andrew J. McFarland, Secretary; and
                            Captain Edwin D. Graves, Jr., U.S.N., Deputy Secretary—and their staffs
                            of planners.</p>
                        <p>On our arrival at the Citadel we found Colonel Richard Park, Jr., U.S.A.,
                            Captain Boyce Price, U.S.A., and Lieutenant Ogden S. Collins, Jr.,
                            U.S.N.R., who had come to Quebec in advance of us and had set up a map
                            room for the President at the Citadel. The same room was used as was
                            used for this purpose during the 1943 Quebec Conference. The Prime
                            Minister had his own map room at the Citadel, with Captain Pim,
                            R.N.V.R., in charge and assisted by Lieutenant Colonel Hughes-Reckett,
                            Lieutenant Commander Murray, R.N.V.R., and Flight Officer Lyttleton.</p>
                        <p>Major DeWitt Greer’s Signal Corps crew had the communications set-up
                            functioning on our arrival at the Citadel, so that the President was
                            never out of instantaneous touch with the White House. War and
                            governmental reports for the President had come to him by radio while on
                            the train en route from Washington to Quebec. At the Citadel we had our
                            own telephone exchange, called “<gloss target="#t_Amco1"><hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Amco</hi></gloss>”. At the Château the U.S.
                            Army maintained a private telephone exchange, called “<gloss
                                target="#t_Victor1"><hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi>.</gloss>” Both
                            exchanges had direct wire service to Washington and the White House.
                            Direct telegraph wire service was also available between the Citadel and
                            the White House.</p>
                        <p>The Chateau Frontenac Hotel had been requisitioned by the Canadian
                            Government for the duration of the conference, as it was in 1943, and
                            all conference representatives of the three nations—Canada, Great
                            Britain and the United States—were quartered and subsisted there as
                            guests of the Canadian Government. The hotel was closed to the general
                            public and was policed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A part of
                            the hotel opening on the Terrace was closed off from the remainder of
                            the hotel and was used as Conference Press Headquarters and telegraph
                            room.</p>
                        <p>The Official Conference Headquarters and conference rooms were in the

                            reports by the Combined British and U.S. Chiefs of Staff were made to
                            the President and the Prime Minister at the Citadel.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Early, Mr. A. D. Dunton, of the Canadian Press Bureau, and Mr.
                            R. J. Cruikshank of the British Ministry of Information held a joint
                            press conference at Conference Press Headquarters at 11:30 a.m. More
                            than 150 newsmen, representing the world’s press, were present. Daily
                            press conferences were held here by these spokesmen of the Canadian,
                            British and United States governments.</p>
                        <p>The President, the Prime Minister, Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. Churchill and
                            Prime Minister Mackenzie King were luncheon guests of the

                        <p>After lunch the President visited his map room in the Citadel. He was
                            joined there by Prime Minister Churchill for a review of the latest war
                            news. Before leaving Washington the President had directed the map room
                            to prepare charts, organization tables and graphs in order to
                            demonstrate quickly the tremendous size of our naval force now stationed
                            in the Western Pacific, with statistics giving an outline of the
                            enormity of the logistics problem. This preparation was made in order
                            that from the very beginning of discussions at Quebec there should be a
                            common understanding of the naval problems and the difficulties of
                            supply. With the help of the charts the President outlined the problem
                            to the Prime Minister.<note n="17" xml:id="d169fn17">No further

                            President spoke next; and finally the Prime Minister of Great Britain. A
                            prepared communiqué concerning the results and purpose of the
                            conference, issued jointly by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister
                            Churchill, was handed to the press at this time. A copy of this
                            communiqué is appended, marked “A”.<note n="41" xml:id="d169fn41">For

                        <p>After the completion of the press conference the President returned to
                            his quarters in the Citadel. Later during the afternoon Princess Alice,
                            Prime Minister Churchill and Mrs. Churchill came to his quarters to bid
                            the President goodbye.</p>
                        <p>The President left the Citadel at 5:30 p.m., together with Admiral Leahy,
                            for his train which had now been moved from the Quebec railroad station
                            back to Wolfe’s Cove. He was accompanied to the train by the
                            Governor-General and Prime Minister King who remained at the station to
                            see him off.</p>
                        <p>Our train departed Quebec (Wolfe’s Cove) at 6:00 p.m., for the return
                            trip to Hyde Park and Washington. We traveled over the lines of the
                            Canadian National Railway, crossing the St. Lawrence just below Quebec
                            and coming via the Provincial towns of Cadorna, Val Alain, St. Leonard
                            Junction, St. Hyacinthe and Southward East to Rouse’s Point.</p>
                        <p>Except for one day (Wednesday) when it rained most of the day, the
                            weather at Quebec during our stay was most pleasant. However, his
                            attendance at the numerous conferences and other engagements prevented
                            the President from leaving the Citadel even once during his six days
                            stay at Quebec.</p>

                        <p>We crossed the International Border at Rouse’s Point, N.Y., at 12:15 a.m.
                            At Rouse’s Point we dropped off our Royal Canadian Mounted Police
                            escort, and also transferred over to the lines and facilities of the
                            Delaware and Hudson Railroad for the continuation of our journey to Hyde
                            Park.</p>
                        <p>We arrived in Albany, N.Y., at 6:45 a.m., where our train was turned over
                            to the New York Central Railroad (West Shore Division).</p>

                            President on his arrival here. The President detrained at 9:20 a.m. and
                            motored to Hyde Park. He was accompanied to Hyde Park by Mrs. Roosevelt,
                            Admiral Leahy, Lieutenant Commander H. G. Bruenn, Medical Corps, U.S.
                            Naval Reserve—who had joined our party at Quebec—, Miss Tully and Mrs.

                        <p>It was not Roosevelt’s practice to make a record of his private
                            conversations with Churchill or to have minutes prepared by subordinates
                            who were present on some of these occasions. There are therefore no
                            American minutes or memoranda of conversation pertaining to most of the
                            Roosevelt–Churchill meetings during the Second Quebec Conference. It is
                            known, however, that at various times during the Conference the two
                            Heads of Government discussed the following subjects in addition to
                            those noted later in this volume with reference to specific meetings: <list>

                                    states: “During the Quebec Conference the Prime Minister and the
                                    President had been considering another meeting of heads of
                                    governments but the President could not leave the United States
                                    until after the election.” It may have been at Quebec that
                                    Roosevelt suggested The Hague as a possible site for a

                                    go so far as to say that he would rather have a de Gaulle France

                                    Stimson on September 20, 1944, Churchill was present at a
                                    discussion in Quebec of this subject. A memorandum on the
                                    September 20 meeting prepared by Harry Dexter White recorded
                                    that Morgenthau said that Churchill “was also strongly opposed

                                    and Development, concerning a meeting held at the White House
                                    that day: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“The President then started discussing the subject
                                            [atomic energy] quite generally. . . . The President was
                                            very much in favor of complete interchange with the
                                            British on this subject after the war in all phases, and
                                            apparently on a basis where it would be used jointly or
                                            not at all. He told of some of his discusions with Mr.
                                            Churchill at Quebec along these lines. . . . The
                                            President’s own statements in regard to post-war
                                            collaboration with Britain on the subject were very
                                            general indeed, but went very far. He pointed out his
                                            belief of the necessity for maintaining the British
                                            Empire strong, and went into some of the methods by
                                            which this could be brought about, which are not
                                            pertinent to this subject. As usual there were a number

                                    this memorandum, Roosevelt told the Archduke that the President
                                    and Churchill had noted, in working on their papers at the
                                    Quebec Conference, that Austria and Hungary “would of all
                                    countries undergo the least territorial changes”. Transylvania
                                    seems to have been discussed specifically by Roosevelt and
                                    Churchill, and also the importance of keeping the Communists out
                                    of Hungary and Austria. The discussion of these questions
                                    presumably took place in the light of the armistice with
                                    Rumania, which was signed at Moscow early on September 13, 1944,

                                reelection, and on the length of Mackenzie King’s prime
                                ministership.</p>

                                    heavy calls for personnel shipping both for the transfer of U.S.
                                    troops other than occupational troops from Europe to the United

                                    British forces to the Far East. In addition the New Zealand and
                                    South African divisions and certain Canadian forces now in

                                    that sufficient emphasis had not been laid on two points:
                                    firstly, the <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0362"/>importance
                                    of securing sea communications and the ports of Antwerp and
                                    Rotterdam, and secondly, the importance of a strong attack being
                                    launched on the northern flank. General Eisenhower in his
                                    telegram had spoken of three possible routes of advance into
                                    Germany. In his (Sir Alan Brooke’s) view the most important was
                                    the northern route of attack which should be strengthened as
                                    much as possible, the remaining two routes being retained as
                                    alternatives. The most energetic efforts should be made to
                                    secure and open the port of Antwerp as a valuable base for
                                    future operations on the northern flank. In order to open the
                                    sea approaches to Antwerp, it seemed desirable to stage an
                                    airborne operation to capture the islands at the mouth of the
                                    Schelde.</p>

                                    ground, it appeared that a more profitable operation would be
                                    the bombing of enemy positions rather than an airborne
                                    operation.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Alan Brooke</hi> said that as he
                                    visualized it, if the Allied armies could break through to the
                                    Plains the enemy forces remaining in northwest Italy would be
                                    badly placed. A threat to Verona would cut off these forces and
                                    might result in their retirement to the westward and later the
                                    retirement of the German forces in northeast Italy back to the
                                    Alps. It was to be hoped that a large number of these eastern
                                    forces could be broken up. The attack by the Fifth Army was
                                    planned to take place on 13 September and a successful advance
                                    north of Florence might well result in driving the enemy forces
                                    back to the Po and Piave.</p>
                                <p>The indications were that the enemy was attempting to withdraw
                                    forces from Greece and Yugoslavia, though there was some doubt
                                    whether he could succeed in getting them out through bad lines
                                    of communications threatened by the Bulgarians, Marshal Tito’s
                                    army and the Greeks. The enemy might, however, get some forces
                                    out and it appeared that he was likely to endeavor to hold a
                                    line running through Yugoslavia. In such an event the enemy
                                    might be reduced to covering the Ljubljana Gap and endeavoring
                                    to hold a line through Yugoslavia and Istria. In these
                                    circumstances any withdrawal of forces from the Fifth Army would
                                    be most regrettable.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Marshall</hi> said that it was not

                                <p>Continuing, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Alan Brooke</hi> said that
                                    the forces to be maintained in Italy might later be limited by
                                    logistics and terrain, Pie saw, however, great advantages in a
                                    right swing at Trieste and an advance from there to Vienna.
                                    However, if German resistance was strong, he did not visualize
                                    the possibility of our forces getting through to Vienna during
                                    the winter. Even so, the seizure of the Istrian Peninsula would
                                    be valuable as a base for the spring campaign or as a base from
                                    which our forces could be introduced into Austria in the event
                                    of Germany crumbling. It had not only a military value but also
                                    political value in view of the Russian advances in the

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Charles Portal</hi> said that
                                    communications had largely become targets for medium and fighter
                                    bombers rather than strategic forces. The proposed directive on
                                    priorities was, of course susceptible to alteration by the
                                    Combined Chiefs of Staff or at the request of General
                                    Eisenhower. In fact, the priority list set forth was, he

                                    of the strategic bombing forces.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Charles Portal</hi> explained that in
                                    this unlikely eventuality they would refer respectively to
                                    General Arnold and himself who, if they could not give a ruling,
                                    would refer the matter to the Combined Chiefs of Staff for
                                    decision.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the declaration of an emergency by a supreme
                                    commander, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Charles Portal</hi>
                                    explained that this same procedure had been in force for
                                    approximately a year in the Mediterranean where it had worked
                                    satisfactorily. An emergency could be declared either for
                                    offense or for defense.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Arnold</hi> said he was particularly
                                    interested in the full utilization of the strategic bombing
                                    force since the United States had in the United Kingdom 2970
                                    heavy bombers and in the Mediterranean 1512 heavy bombers,
                                    making a total of 4482. Of these, 2980 were operational and each
                                    aircraft had two crews available and therefore could be used
                                    every day. Was the proposed chain of command the best setup to
                                    obtain the maximum use from this very large force?</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Charles Portal</hi> said he felt that it
                                    was. The Supreme Commander’s role in the chain of command, which
                                    had been valuable in the first phases of <gloss
                                        target="#t_Overlord1"><hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >Overlord</hi></gloss> was, in his opinion, no longer useful
                                    and better results would be obtained from the proposed command
                                    arrangements.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Leahy</hi> questioned the proposed
                                    directive with regard to the right of a commander in the field
                                    to get from the strategic air forces the air support which he
                                    requested. This, he felt, was essential.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Charles Portal</hi> said that the system
                                    was exactly the same as had been used in the Mediterranean where
                                    the Supreme Commander <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0371"
                                    />had declared an emergency on only one occasion. This, as he
                                    remembered, was on the fifth day of the battle at Salerno. The
                                    declaration of an emergency by a supreme commander was in effect
                                    a direct order from the Combined Chiefs of Staff for the use of
                                    the strategic air forces as directed by the supreme commander.
                                    He said he could guarantee on the British side that the supreme
                                    commanders would always get what they needed when they needed
                                    it. The use of the emergency procedure should be regarded only
                                    as “the big stick” which could be used but probably would never
                                    have to be.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Marshall</hi> suggested an
                                    alternative arrangement whereby a small assignment of strategic
                                    air might be made to supreme commanders, the remainder being
                                    controlled as suggested in the British paper.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Charles Portal</hi> agreed that this was
                                    a possible solution. He felt, however, that in a real emergency
                                    the supreme commander must have all the bombers that he needed.
                                    Divided control might result in the supreme commander’s
                                    allotment not being fully used on all occasions.</p>

                                            ideas about winning the war. At that particular moment
                                            he thought it a matter of vital British interest that we
                                            (including the <gloss target="#t_RAF1">R.A.F.</gloss>)
                                            get more planes, ships, and soldiers into the final
                                            battle of Japan as soon as we could. I told him the
                                            question of putting planes in there wasn’t quite that
                                            simple. There were not enough land masses in the Pacific
                                            Ocean to use the heavy bombers we would have available
                                            from Europe when that phase of the war was over. As a
                                            matter of fact, if we could use 1500 out of the 3500 we

                                    revolutionary turn for the good. Everything we had touched had
                                    turned to gold, and during the last seven weeks there had been
                                    an unbroken run of military successes. The manner in which the
                                    situation had developed since the Teheran Conference gave the
                                    impression of remarkable design and precision of execution.
                                    First there had been the Anzio landing, and then, on the same

                                    gratifying results. It was already probable that eight or nine
                                    thousand prisoners had been captured, and the south and western
                                    parts of France were now being systematically cleared of the
                                    enemy. He was firmly convinced that future historians would give
                                    a great account of the period since Teheran.<note n="2"

                                    that he was glad to be able to record that, although the British
                                    Empire had now entered the sixth year of the war it was still
                                    keeping its end up with an over-all population, including the
                                    overseas Dominions and Colonies, of only 70,000,000 white
                                    people. The British Empire effort in Europe, counted in terms of
                                    divisions in the field, was about equal to that of the United
                                    States. This was as it should be. He was proud that the British
                                    Empire could claim equal partnership with their great ally, the
                                    United States, whom he regarded as the greatest military power
                                    in the world. The British Empire effort had now reached its
                                    peak, whereas that of their ally was ever-increasing. There was
                                    complete confidence in General Eisenhower and his relations with
                                    General Montgomery were of the best, as were those between
                                    General Montgomery and General Bradley. The part played by
                                    General W. B. Smith in directing and cementing the staffs was of
                                    the highest order. The control of operations in France was in
                                    capable hands. An efficient integrated American-British staff
                                    machine had been built up, and the battle was being brilliantly
                                    exploited.</p>

                                    said that General Alexander had resumed the offensive at the end
                                    of August. Since then the Eighth Army had suffered about 8,000
                                    and the Fifth Army about 1,000 casualties. The Fifth Army had
                                    hitherto not been so heavily engaged, but they were expected to
                                    make a thrust that very day. The British have a great stake in
                                    Italy. The army in this theater was the largest <pb n="314"

                                    Army in existence. There were in all sixteen British Empire
                                    divisions, consisting of eight British, two Canadian, one New
                                    Zealand, one South African and four British Indian divisions.
                                    He, the Prime Minister, had been anxious lest General Alexander
                                    might be shorn of certain essentials for the vigorous
                                    prosecution of his campaign. He now understood that the Combined
                                    Chiefs of Staff had agreed that there should be no withdrawals
                                    from General Alexander’s Army until either Kesselring’s Army had
                                    been beaten, or was on the run out of Italy.<note n="3"

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Prime Minister</hi> emphasized that if
                                    the Germans were run out of Italy we should have to look for
                                    fresh fields and pastures new. It would never do for our armies
                                    to remain idle. He had always been attracted by a right-handed
                                    movement, with the purpose of giving Germany a stab in the
                                    armpit. Our objective should be Vienna. If German resistance
                                    collapsed, we should, of course, be able to reach Vienna more
                                    quickly and more easily. If not, to assist this movement, he had
                                    given considerable thought to an operation for the capture of
                                    Istria, which would include the occupation of Trieste and Fiume.
                                    Pie had been relieved to learn that the United States Chiefs of
                                    Staff were willing to leave in the Mediterranean certain <gloss

                                    An added reason for this right-handed movement was the rapid
                                    encroachment of the Russians into the Balkans and the consequent
                                    dangerous spread of Russian influence in this area. He preferred

                                    campaign in Burma. This had been on a considerable scale.
                                    250,000 men had been engaged, and the fighting for Imphal and
                                    Kohima had been extremely bitter. General Stilwell was to be
                                    congratulated on his brilliant operation, resulting in the
                                    capture of Myitkyina. There had been 40,000 battle casualties
                                    and 288,000 sick of which latter, happily, the great proportion
                                    recovered and returned to duty. As a result of this campaign,
                                    the air line to China had been kept open and India rendered
                                    secure from attack. It was estimated that the Japanese had lost
                                    100,000 men in this, the largest land engagement of Japanese
                                    forces.</p>

                                    did not permit a decision being taken now to withdraw forces.
                                    What was wanted was to keep an option open for as long as
                                    possible, and every effort was being directed to this end.</p>

                                    defeated. Far from shirking this task, the British Empire was

                                    doing so. Japan was as much the bitter enemy of the British

                                    15–inch battleship. A fleet train of ample proportions had been
                                    built up, which would render the fleet independent for a
                                    considerable time of shore base resources. He said that the
                                    placing of a British fleet in the Central Pacific would not
                                    prevent a detachment being made to work with General MacArthur
                                    in the Southwest Pacific if this was desired. This would include
                                    air forces. There was, of course, no intention to interfere in
                                    any way with General MacArthur’s command.</p>
                                <p>As a further contribution to the defeat of the enemy, the Royal
                                    Air Force would like to take a part in the heavy bombardment of
                                    Japan. A bomber force of 1500 planes could be made available for
                                    this purpose and would like a proportionate share with the four
                                    or five thousand American planes in striking at the heart of the
                                    enemy. As regards land forces, when Germany had been beaten, it
                                    would probably be possible to move six divisions from the
                                    European Theater to the East, to be followed perhaps by a
                                    further six at a later date. In Burma there were 15 divisions

                                    of which had been a grievous and shameful blow to British
                                    prestige which must be avenged. It would not be good enough for
                                    Singapore to be returned to us at the peace table. We should
                                    recover it in battle. These operations would not debar the
                                    employment of small British Empire components with United States
                                    forces in the Pacific.</p>

                                    out in advance. Our keyword should be to engage the largest

                                    representatives there had been ever-increasing solidarity of
                                    outlook and identity of basic thought. Added to this there had
                                    always been an atmosphere of cordiality and friendship. Our
                                    fortunes had prospered but it was still not quite possible to
                                    forecast the date of the end of the war with Germany.</p>
                                <p>It seemed clear that the Germans were withdrawing from the
                                    Balkans and appeared likely that in Italy they would retire to
                                    the line of the Alps. The Russians were on the edge of Hungary.
                                    The Germans had shown themselves good at staging withdrawals and
                                    had been able to save large numbers of personnel although much
                                    material had been lost. If the battle went well with General
                                    Alexander, we should reach the Piave reasonably soon. All forces
                                    in Italy should be engaged to the maximum intensity.</p>
                                <p>In the west it seemed probable that the Germans would retire
                                    behind the Rhine. In his view the “West Wall” was the right bank
                                    of the Rhine which would present a formidable obstacle. He
                                    thought we should plan to force the barrier of the Rhine and
                                    then consider the situation. We should have to turn the line
                                    either from the east or from the west. For this purpose our
                                    plans must be flexible. The Germans could not yet be counted out
                                    and one more big battle would have to be fought. The operations
                                    in the East would to some extent depend on how the situation
                                    developed in Europe. He agreed that we should not remain in
                                    Burma any longer than it was necessary to clean up the Japanese
                                    in that theater. The American plan was to regain the Philippines
                                    and to dominate the mainland of Japan from the Philippines or
                                    Formosa and from bridgeheads which would be seized in China. If
                                    forces could be established on the mainland of China, China
                                    could be saved. American experience had been that the “end run”
                                    method paid a handsome dividend. Rabaul was an example of this
                                    by-passing technique which had been employed with considerable
                                    success <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0377"/>at small cost
                                    of life. Would it not be equally possible to by-pass Singapore
                                    by seizing an area to the north or east of it, for example,
                                    Bangkok? Singapore may be very strong and he was opposed to
                                    going up against strong positions.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Prime Minister</hi> suggested that the
                                    seizure of localities such as Penang and the Kra Isthmus or

                                    he did not favor the by-passing method. There would undoubtedly
                                    be a large force of Japanese in the Malay Peninsula and it would
                                    help the American operations in the Pacific if we could bring
                                    these forces to action and destroy them in addition to achieving
                                    the great prize of the recapture of Singapore. If Formosa were
                                    captured, would the Japanese garrisons to the south be
                                    completely cut off?</p>

                                    It should not be overlooked that Marshal Stalin had volunteered

                                    There was no reason to doubt that Stalin would be as good as his
                                    word. The Russians undoubtedly had great ambitions in the East.
                                    If Hitler was beaten, say, by January, and Japan was confronted
                                    with the three most powerful nations in the world, they would
                                    undoubtedly have cause for reflection as to whether they could

                                    information on the substance of the conversation which has been
                                    found is that contained in a memorandum by the Secretary of the
                                    Treasury’s Assistant (White), <hi rend="italic">post</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_323">p. 323</ref>, where it is indicated that
                                    later on September 13 Roosevelt told Morgenthau about his
                                    conversation with Churchill, presumably during luncheon.
                                    According to this source, Roosevelt had asked Churchill, who had
                                    been very glum, how he would like to have the steel business of
                                    Europe for twenty or thirty years, and Churchill had “seemed
                                    much excited over the possibility”.</p>
                                <p>At one of the Roosevelt–Churchill meetings on September 13, a
                                    suggestion was made that Fiorello La Guardia should go to Italy
                                    as the President’s representative and that while there he should
                                    be invited to attend the meetings of the Allied Control
                                    Commission. See Churchill’s allusion to this suggestion in a
                                    letter to Roosevelt dated September 14, 1944, <hi rend="italic"

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Alan Brooke</hi> said that the British
                                    Chiefs of Staff were in agreement with the course of action for

                                    however, one point he would like to make. In addition to the
                                    operations outlined in the paper there would, of course, be
                                    certain British operations which the British Chiefs of Staff had
                                    not yet had an opportunity to put forward. For instance, the
                                    British Fleet participating in the Pacific operations, the
                                    British Task Force in the Southwest Pacific and Operation <gloss

                                        >Dracula</hi></gloss>. In making provision, therefore, for
                                    the U.S. operations it should be borne in mind that there would
                                    also be certain British operations, the forces for which will
                                    require allocation of certain items of equipment for which
                                    provision should be made and a margin of requirements
                                    allowed.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John Dill</hi> explained that supplies

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Alan Brooke</hi> said that all that was

                                <p>No record of the discussion at this meeting has been found which
                                    was prepared by one of the participants listed above. The
                                    memorandum printed below was prepared by Harry Dexter White, who
                                    accompanied Morgenthau to Quebec. Since this memorandum does not
                                    indicate that White himself was present, it seems probable that
                                    White was summarizing what Morgenthau had told him, or told
                                    others in his presence, between September 13 and the date on
                                    which White’s memorandum was prepared. Following is the text of
                                    the memorandum, which bears the date “9/25/44” at the end

                                            said that Churchill seemed much excited over the

                                            how freely he could talk with the Professor and the
                                            President replied, ‘You can talk about anything you

                                            whole section and said, ‘I wouldn’t discuss with him the
                                            question of the zones to be occupied by our armies.
                                            That’s a military question. Nor would I discuss the
                                            question of partitioning as that’s a political question.
                                            But you can talk about the fact that we are thinking of
                                            internationalizing the Ruhr and the Saar, including the
                                            Kiel Canal. If Holland has a lot of land inundated by
                                            Germany we can give her a piece of Western Germany as
                                            compensation.’</p>
                                        <p>“The President went over the whole of the first section
                                            of the book, item by item, and then said: ‘I have sent
                                            for Eden. Churchill, Eden, yourself and I will sit down
                                            to discuss the matter.’ (The Secretary expressed the
                                            view that the President gave him the impression that he
                                            was bringing Eden to Quebec largely because of the
                                            report he (the Secretary) gave him upon his return from
                                            England about Eden being tough on the question of a
                                            policy toward Germany.)<note n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">Cf.

                                            going to be tough too.’ As the Secretary was leaving,
                                            the President said to Miss Tully, ‘Put that book right

                                            drastic action, <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0385"

                                            or the yards in which to build them; what they needed
                                            could be carried in our ships. Morgenthau wanted to
                                            close down the Ruhr to help British exports, especially
                                            steel. The <gloss target="#t_PM1">P.M.</gloss> was
                                            against this. He did not seem happy about all this
                                            toughness.</p>
                                        <p>“‘I’m all for disarming Germany,’ he said, ‘but we ought

                                            between the working classes of all countries, and the
                                            English people will not stand for the policy you are
                                            advocating.’</p>
                                        <p>“I thought he had done when he growled:</p>
                                        <p>“‘I agree with Burke. You cannot indict a whole
                                            nation.’</p>
                                        <p>“If the <gloss target="#t_PM1">P.M.</gloss> was vague
                                            about what ought to be done with Germany, he was at
                                            least quite clear what should <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                                            be done. He kept saying:</p>

                                        <p>“Morgenthau asked the <gloss target="#t_PM1">P.M.</gloss>
                                            how he could prevent Britain starving when her exports
                                            had fallen so low that she would be unable to pay for
                                            imports. The <gloss target="#t_PM1">P.M.</gloss> had no
                                            satisfactory answer. His thoughts seemed to go back to
                                            the House of Commons and what he knew of the English
                                            people. In five years’ time, when passions would have
                                            died down, people, he said, would not stand for
                                            repressive measures. He harped on the necessity for
                                            disarmament. At that point one of the Americans
                                            intervened: he thought that Germany should be made to
                                            return to a pastoral state, she ought to have a lower
                                            standard of living. During all this wild talk only the
                                                <gloss target="#t_PM1">P.M.</gloss> seemed to have
                                            his feet on the ground. The President mostly listened;
                                            once he remarked that a factory which made steel
                                            furniture could be turned overnight to war

                                <p>On September 20, 1944, Morgenthau told Hull and Stimson that at
                                    this dinner meeting Churchill was violently opposed to the
                                    policy on Germany which was presented to him. He quoted
                                    Churchill as inquiring with annoyance whether he had been
                                    brought to Quebec to discuss such a scheme and as stating that
                                    it would mean that England would be chained to a dead body,
                                    i.e., Germany. See a memorandum by the Deputy Director of the

                                <p>Morgenthau, writing of the September 13 dinner meeting three
                                    years later, recalled that Churchill had been irascible and
                                    vitriolic when, at Roosevelt’s request, Morgenthau had explained
                                    the Treasury proposal. Churchill, he said, turned loose “the
                                    full flood of his rhetoric, sarcasm and violence”, stating that
                                    he looked on the Treasury plan “as he <pb n="326"

                                <p>The most detailed description of the dinner conversation which
                                    has been found was written by Harry Dexter White, who
                                    accompanied Morgenthau to Quebec. No source on the meeting
                                    (including White’s memorandum itself) states that White was
                                    present, and it seems probable that White was summarizing what
                                    Morgenthau had told him, or told others in his presence, in the
                                    period between September 13 and the date on which White’s
                                    memorandum was prepared. Following is the text of the
                                    memorandum, which bears the date “9/25/44” at the end
                                    (presumably the date of typing): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“Though shipping was supposed to have been the subject
                                            for discussion the subject of shipping was not mentioned
                                            the entire evening except briefly when the question was

                                            previously) said something along the line of ‘What are

                                            without first discussing them with me? I intend to get
                                            into the matter myself.’</p>
                                        <p>“The President said he had asked Secretary Morgenthau to

                                            he (Morgenthau) was to talk to Cherwell the following

                                            program he had in mind for Germany. The Secretary
                                            described that part of the Treasury proposal dealing
                                            with the Ruhr,<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4">See <hi

                                            Churchill indicated that he was strongly opposed to such
                                            a program. Pie said that all that was necessary was to
                                            eliminate the production of armament. To do what the
                                            Treasury suggested was ‘unnatural, unchristian and
                                            unnecessary.’ Churchill didn’t believe that it would be
                                            very much of an aid to the United Kingdom even if the
                                            United Kingdom did get the steel business that formerly
                                            went to Germany.</p>

                                            the table to emphasize his remark. Admiral Land told the
                                            Secretary after the dinner that the President had been
                                            talking with him more or less along those lines for a

                                            down’ on any country which stepped over the boundary
                                            line of any other country.</p>
                                        <p>“The President said very little in reply to Churchill’s
                                            views. Secretary Morgenthau several times interjected
                                            into Churchill’s comments that his program did not
                                            recommend that Germany be permitted to starve as seemed
                                            to be the implication in Churchill’s remark.</p>
                                        <p>“At another point when discussing the need for an
                                            international police air force Churchill said that the
                                            United States, United Kingdom and Russia would have to
                                            rotate the job ‘as our air people get dirty when they
                                            associate with the Russians.’</p>
                                        <p>“At one point in the discussion Churchill said to the
                                            President: ‘Is this what you asked me to come all the
                                            way over here to discuss?’</p>
                                        <p>“The conversation then got on to India and stayed on
                                            India for about an hour. Churchill talked rather angrily
                                            at length about the difficulties the British were
                                            confronted with in administering India and on the lack
                                            of understanding in the United States about the Indian
                                            problem. He spoke of the high birth rate, the high death
                                            rate, the ignorance and the carelessness of the Indian
                                            people to poverty, disease, etc. Churchill said, ‘I will
                                            give the United States half of India to administer and
                                            we will take the other half and we will see who does
                                            better with each other’s half.’</p>
                                        <p>“However, the President came back to the German problem
                                            several times very nicely and did not recede from his
                                            position. He reminded Churchill that Stalin at Teheran
                                            had said: ‘Are you going to let Germany produce modern
                                            metal furniture? The manufacture of metal furniture can
                                            be quickly turned into the manufacture of
                                                armament.’<note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">See <ref

                                        <p>“Lord Cherwell seemed to be in sympathy with the
                                            Secretary’s point of view. Later when talking it over
                                            with him he said that he didn’t think that Churchill at
                                            all got the major point the Secretary was trying to
                                            make. The Secretary asked him if he didn’t think the
                                            real difficulty with Churchill was that he wanted a
                                            strong Germany to stand between ‘the white cliffs of
                                            Dover’ and Communist Russia. Cherwell agreed that that
                                            was it. Lord Leathers of the Shipping Board apparently
                                            disagreed with the Secretary’s point of view.</p>
                                        <p>“On leaving, Lord Cherwell said that he expected to talk
                                            with the Secretary about lend-lease assistance for the
                                            period between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of
                                            Japan. The Secretary told him that he had been asked by
                                            the President to come to talk about Germany but after
                                                [<hi rend="italic">that?</hi>] he would be glad to
                                            discuss lend-lease aid the following morning after they
                                            had had their conversation about Germany.</p>
                                        <p>“The Secretary had an opportunity to tell the President
                                            that he believed the Russians were holding back on their
                                            cooperation with the United States because they were
                                            suspicious of the American and British attitude toward
                                            Germany. Russia feared we and the British were going to
                                            try to make a soft peace with Germany and build her <pb

                                            possible future counter-weight against Russia. The
                                            President replied, ‘You are right, and I want you to
                                            read a telegram I just received from Harriman.’ Admiral
                                            Leahy later gave the Secretary the telegram which
                                            Harriman sent to Harry Hopkins urging the President to
                                            call him (Harriman) home to report on the trend in
                                            Russia on non-cooperation with the United States.<note

                                <p>The Secretary asked Cherwell which of the two subjects before
                                    them for discussion would he like to take up first. Cherwell
                                    replied that he would like to take up the lend-lease program
                                    first since he thought that would be simpler to dispose of than
                                    the question of policy toward Germany. Cherwell went into some
                                    detail on the need for getting to work quickly on a lend-lease
                                    program for England during the period after the defeat of
                                    Germany and before the defeat of Japan. He outlined British
                                    views of what would be appropriate for England to receive in the
                                    way of lend-lease aid. He described England’s need for
                                    increasing her exports and relaxing on the home working front.
                                    He expressed the view that a cut of 27 percent in our lend-lease
                                    to the British Empire would appear reasonable to the
                                        British.<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">It was probably at this

                                    England. He then told Cherwell about his conversation with the
                                    Exchequer and with the President<note n="5" xml:id="d182fn5">See
                                        Blum, pp. 307–309.</note> and said that it was now up to
                                    Churchill. If Churchill thought that the idea of forming a
                                    committee to handle the whole problem was a good one, it was up
                                    to Churchill to suggest it to the President.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary also said that he didn’t like the approach of
                                    determining the amount of lend-lease aid that Britain was to get
                                    that Cherwell presented. In his (the Secretary’s) opinion, the
                                    question should be approached from the point of view of just how
                                    much munitions the British need in the role that they are to
                                    play in the Pacific. The Secretary thought that food shipments
                                    could be handled all right but he felt that commercial goods
                                    could not appropriately go into exports.</p>
                                <p>In any case, the Secretary stressed the need for its being
                                    handled by a joint committee of British and Americans. Cherwell
                                    liked the idea of the committee and asked whether the Secretary
                                    would head it up. The Secretary replied that he didn’t know;
                                    that that was up to the President. The Secretary told Cherwell
                                    that the President had given him (Morgenthau) for his comment a
                                    memorandum prepared by the State Department<note n="6"
                                        xml:id="d182fn6">The reference is presumably to Hull’s
                                        memorandum to Roosevelt of September 8, 1944, <hi

                                    somebody from State Department or possibly the Treasury to head
                                    up the committee. Cherwell suggested that White and MacDougall
                                    attempt to draft a directive setting up such a committee so that
                                    if the Prime Minister and the President did agree on the idea
                                    they might get it out then and there. The Secretary agreed.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary then took up the question of Germany. He handed
                                    Cherwell the book on Germany<note n="7" xml:id="d182fn7"><hi

                                    compiled on a day’s notice. Cherwell read hurriedly through the
                                    first part and expressed skepticism as to whether Organized
                                    Labor in the United States would approve a program so drastic in
                                    character. Secretary Morgenthau thought that it would. Cherwell
                                    commented that he didn’t understand why Churchill had taken so
                                    contrary a position on the program the evening before. He
                                    (Cherwell) was surprised at Churchill’s attitude and thought
                                    possibly that it was due to the fact that Churchill did not
                                    wholly understand what the Secretary was driving at.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary told Cherwell that Secretary Hull was in general
                                    agreement with the views expressed by the Treasury<note n="8"

                                    He said that the question came down to a choice of: “Do you want
                                    a strong Germany and a weak England or a weak Germany and a
                                    strong England?” The Secretary said that he preferred to rely on
                                    a strong England and a weak Germany.</p>
                                <p>Cherwell thought that the proposal could be dressed up in a way
                                    to be more attractive to the Prime Minister and the Secretary
                                    said that he would be very glad to have Cherwell try it.</p>
                                <p>After the Secretary and Cherwell left to see the President and
                                    Churchill to report on the morning’s conversation, I talked at
                                    length with MacDougall on the merits of the Treasury’s proposed
                                    program and MacDougall appeared to be in agreement. Later
                                    MacDougall, a Mr. Weeks of the British Government, and I met to

                                <p>When the Secretary returned with Cherwell from the President and
                                    the Prime Minister, he reported that both Churchill and the
                                    President had liked the idea of creating a committee. They
                                    wanted to set up one on an informal and <hi rend="italic">ad

                                    to the question of who should be the chairman of the joint
                                    committee that Churchill had said, “Plow about Harry Hopkins?”
                                    But the President had replied, “No, I want Morgenthau to be
                                    chairman.”</p>

                                    452/27 with regard to British participation in the war against
                                    Japan. He realized that this paper had been written before the
                                    Plenary session on the previous day. He felt that it did not
                                    entirely coincide with the proposal put forward at that
                                    conference and accepted by the President. For political reasons
                                    it was essential that the British Fleet should take part in the
                                    main operations against Japan.</p>

                                    the western flank of the advance in the Southwest Pacific.” It
                                    might be that the British Fleet would be used initially in the
                                    Bay of Bengal and thereafter as required by the existing
                                    situation.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Andrew Cunningham</hi> said that the

                                    agreed to the deletion proposed by Admiral Leahy.</p>

                                <p>Continuing, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Andrew Cunningham</hi> asked
                                    the U.S. views as to the meaning of the term “balanced forces”
                                    in the final sentence of paragraph 1 of <gloss target="#t_CCS1"
                                        >C.C.S.</gloss> 452/27. He said that the British Chiefs of
                                    Staff had in mind a force of some 4 battleships, 5 to 6 large
                                    carriers, 20 light fleet carriers and <gloss target="#t_CVE1"

                                    destroyers. This he would regard as a balanced force.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral King</hi> stressed that it was

                                    rear bases—probably in Australia. The provision of bases would
                                    be a matter for agreement.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Leahy</hi> said that he did not feel
                                    that the question for discussion was the practicability of
                                    employment but rather the matter of where they should be
                                    employed from time to time.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Andrew Cunningham</hi> referred to the

                                    should briefly outline the British views with regard to future
                                    operations in Burma. It was the British intention to endeavor to
                                    carry out operations aimed at liquidating the Burma commitment
                                    as soon as possible. This commitment was a heavy one,
                                    particularly with regard to casualties from sickness and the
                                    large numbers of men required in view of the long and tenuous
                                    lines of communication. For instance, an ordinary division
                                    amounted to some 40,000 men, whereas one particular division in
                                    Southeast Asia required approximately 90,000. The reconquest of
                                    Burma would also eliminate the commitments for the protection of
                                    the northeast frontier of India and the air route to China.</p>
                                <p>With these objects in view, operations against Rangoon had been
                                    examined. A seaborne amphibious operation was extremely
                                    difficult due to the fact that Rangoon lay some way up a river
                                    and the surrounding terrain was extremely marshy. An airborne
                                    assault had therefore been considered. By the use of airborne
                                    forces it was thought that the airfields to the north of Rangoon
                                    could be seized and that formations could then be flown in.
                                    These formations would seize the area to the north of Rangoon,
                                    then open up the river communications through Rangoon, block the
                                    Pegu route and then eliminate the Japanese in Burma by
                                    operations both from the south and from the north. If this could
                                    be achieved we should be in far better position. Forces could be
                                    released from the theater and the protection of India would be
                                    simplified.</p>
                                <p>To sum up, we should eliminate the Burma commitment, secure the
                                    air route to China, and possibly at a later date a land route,
                                    and obtain jumping-off places for further operations against
                                    Bangkok or to the Kra Peninsula and from there to Singapore.</p>
                                <p>Admiral Mountbatten had prepared a plan. This, however, had
                                    entailed removing forces from north Burma, which was felt to be
                                    unacceptable. The possibility therefore of obtaining forces from
                                    Europe had been examined. It was estimated that a decision to
                                    remove these forces would have to be taken by the first of
                                    October and that they would include the 6th Airborne Division,
                                    the 52nd Division, and the 3rd Division, from northwest Europe
                                    and three Indian divisions from Italy. There were certain
                                    difficulties with regard to this plan. The Indian troops who had
                                    been fighting for five years would have to be taken home and
                                    given three weeks’ leave. This would take some time since many
                                    of them lived in extremely inaccessible parts of India,
                                    entailing in some cases a journey of a month each way to their
                                    homes. Further, India’s capacity to absorb personnel was limited
                                    and had been estimated at 50,000 a month, though it was believed
                                    that this could, in certain instances, be raised to 80,000 a
                                    month. If forces were <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0397"
                                    />brought to India, it was estimated that two months must elapse
                                    between their arrival and the period when they would be ready to
                                    start. Every effort was being made to try and cut the time
                                    factor in this jig-saw puzzle, but there was no doubt that the
                                    moves ought to begin in October if the 15th of March was taken
                                    as the date for Operation <gloss target="#t_Dracula1"><hi
                                            rend="smallcaps">Dracula</hi></gloss>. It might be
                                    possible to postpone this date until the 1st of April, the
                                    limiting factor being the weather conditions in April rendering
                                    the airdromes north of Rangoon unserviceable.</p>
                                <p>Another possibility might be to undertake the operation with
                                    fewer forces. However, if the operation was launched and
                                    Japanese resistance was extremely strong, we should find
                                    ourselves in a difficult position since the nearest reserves
                                    would be in northwest Europe or Italy. It was felt therefore
                                    that if the operation was to be undertaken it must be undertaken
                                    with an adequate margin of strength. Operations in Europe did
                                    not permit of reaching a decision at the present time with
                                    regard to the removal of the necessary forces, i.e., three
                                    divisions from Italy and three divisions from northwest Europe.
                                    Further, there was the question of the administrative troops
                                    which would be required, particularly signal and movement
                                    personnel. These were of the utmost importance to the 21st Army
                                    Group and to General Alexander if his army advanced towards the
                                    Po. The situation was such therefore that we could not at
                                    present gamble by removing these troops. Every effort was being
                                    made to reduce the estimated time from the removal of the troops
                                    from Europe till the launching of the operation in order that a
                                    decision could be postponed and yet the operation be undertaken
                                    in the spring. Such a decision with regard to withdrawal of
                                    troops from Europe might be possible in a month’s time. There
                                    were also the complications of the regulations now being
                                    instituted with regard to conditions of service for the war
                                    against Japan, the giving of leave before troops who had been
                                    fighting for many years were sent to a new theater, and the
                                    question of the release of men who had over five years of war
                                    service. Every conceivable effort was being made to find the
                                    necessary forces to carry out <gloss target="#t_Dracula1"><hi
                                            rend="smallcaps">Dracula</hi></gloss> in the spring. If
                                    it were carried out, then Admiral Mountbatten’s advance in the
                                    north would be limited, whereas if the operation was postponed
                                    till November, he could fight his way much further south.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Charles Portal</hi> said that the air
                                    transport side of the problem was all-important. At present
                                    Admiral Mountbatten had 448 transport aircraft, and required
                                    1200 for the Rangoon operation. Only 190 of the additional 752
                                    required could be found from British sources, and these only
                                    from operations in Europe. The remainder would have to be
                                    provided by the United States either from Europe or from
                                    elsewhere if they were available.</p>

                                    eliminated, since it was hoped that the redeployment of forces

                                        <p>“The Twentieth Air Force is designed around and includes

                                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_B291">B–29</gloss> airplane, which
                                            is the basis of the Twentieth Air Force, is a very long
                                            range, fast, heavily armed precision day bomber. At
                                            maximum combat loading its gross weight is 140,000
                                            pounds at which weight it operates up to 30,000-feet
                                            altitudes at a top speed of 370 miles per hour and
                                            cruises at 220 miles per hour. During a normal combat
                                            mission it burns 450 gallons per hour and at high speed
                                            consumes up to 700 gallons per hour. The airplane is
                                            operated by a crew of 11 men. A notable feature is the
                                            airplane pressurization which results in providing
                                            inside pressure equivalent to altitudes of about 8,000
                                            feet when the airplane is actually at 30,000 feet. The
                                            most notable feature, however, is probably the central
                                            fire control features whereby three centrally located
                                            gunners handle, with precision, twelve 50-caliber
                                            machine guns and one 20 mm. cannon, all remotely
                                            controlled. In spite of its weight, this airplane can be
                                            operated from 8500-foot runways at maximum gross
                                            loadings and from 7500-foot runways when loaded to
                                            135,000 pounds.</p>

                                <p>Cherwell’s two memoranda, printed below, constitute the principal
                                    source on this meeting. On September 19, in a meeting with
                                    officials of the Treasury Department in Washington, Morgenthau
                                    recounted Churchill’s violent opposition on the evening of
                                    September 13 to the “Morgenthau Plan” for the postwar treatment
                                    of Germany (see <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_325">p. 325</ref>) and then described the German
                                    discussion on the morning of September 14 as follows: “And then
                                    to my amazement, on presenting it the next morning through …
                                    Lord Cherwell—it was presented the next morning very much
                                    softened down. Mr. Churchill interrupted <pb n="343"

                                    And then we tried to set it down and we couldn’t because it
                                    wasn’t strong enough.” (Morgenthau Diary, vol. 772) White, in
                                    recording a meeting between Morgenthau and Cherwell on the
                                    morning of September 15 (see <hi rend="italic">post</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_359">p. 359</ref>), quoted Morgenthau as saying,
                                    with reference to the Roosevelt–Churchill meeting on September
                                    14, that Churchill “seemed to accept the program designed to
                                    weaken German economy.… Churchill had already spoken of
                                    diverting Germany to an agricultural state as she was in the
                                    last quarter of the 19th Century.” (Treasury Files)</p>

                                        September 15, 1944 (see <hi rend="italic">post</hi>, <ref

                                        “went too far in the wrong direction”. According to
                                        Morgenthau’s diary entry for September 15, Morgenthau felt
                                        that Cherwell’s minutes “presented much too weak a case” and
                                        that Churchill could be prevailed upon “to go much further”.
                                        Morgenthau and Cherwell, by agreement, therefore, reported
                                        that they did not have minutes on the German discussion of
                                        September 14 when Churchill asked for them on September 15.

                                    to give his impressions of these.</p>
                                <p>Lord Cherwell said he had, of course, not had time to read the
                                    papers or study the proposals in detail but he was definitely
                                    attracted by the possibilities set forth. So far as he
                                    understood it the intention was to hamstring Germany’s capacity
                                    for making war by taking whatever machinery was usable from the
                                    Ruhr and other areas in which industry capable of making
                                    war-like weapons was concentrated, and handing it over to the
                                    numerous countries she had devastated. The Ruhr and perhaps the
                                    other areas in question would be then placed under an
                                    international authority which should decide whether and when and
                                    to what degree industries of this type should be allowed to be
                                    re-built there. If the Germans were deprived of the possibility
                                    of making steel on a large scale as well as certain types of
                                    chemicals and electrical machinery, she would not be in a
                                    position to produce the armaments required for modern war. She
                                    would, of course, not starve. Her exports would be reduced and
                                    she might therefore go short of certain materials. But her
                                    standard of life would still undoubtedly be higher than it had
                                    been under the Nazis—when so much national effort was put into
                                        <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0404"/>preparations for
                                    war—even if she was unable to establish the same high standard
                                    she enjoyed for some time before that. The consequence that her
                                    export markets would become available for the U.K. and U.S.A.
                                    did not seem a disadvantage.</p>
                                <p>The Prime Minister said that he thought there was a good deal to
                                    be said for this approach to the problem. We were entitled to
                                    make sure Germany could not commit wanton acts of aggression and
                                    the Russians would probably in any case insist on obtaining any
                                    machinery available with which to restore the factories which
                                    Germany had ruined in her advance into Russia.</p>
                                <p>Mr Morgenthau said that he could see no other way in which we
                                    could be sure of preventing the rearming of Germany. Great
                                    productive capacity was necessary for modern war and it could
                                    not be built up secretly. The removal of all the machinery and
                                    facilities should be undertaken as soon as possible, say, within
                                    the first six months of our troops entering the Ruhr. Thereafter
                                    this region should be put under international control which
                                    would see that it was not exploited again in the way Germany had
                                    used it to prepare the wanton acts of aggression she had
                                    committed.</p>
                                <p>The President said that he did not think it would be an undue
                                    hardship to require Germany to revert towards an agricultural
                                    status such as she had enjoyed up to the latter part of the last
                                    century. She had shown she could not be trusted with all these
                                    facilities for making weapons.</p>
                                <p>The Prime Minister said he was converted to the idea that we
                                    should explore this line of approach and see whether concrete
                                    suggestions could be worked out to ensure security and which it
                                    might be hoped would secure the approval of the United
                                    Nations.</p>

                                    that the President would agree that during the war with Japan we

                                <p>He hoped also that the President would agree that it would be
                                    proper for Lend/Lease munitions to continue on a proportional
                                    basis even though this would enable the United Kingdom to set
                                    free labour for re-building, exports, etc., e.g., if British
                                    munitions production were cut to three-fifths, U.S. assistance
                                    should also fall to three-fifths. The President indicated
                                    assent. Mr. Morgenthau however suggested that it would be better
                                    to have definite figures. He understood that munitions

                                    3½ billion dollars in the first year on the basis of the
                                    strategy envisaged before the <gloss target="#t_Octagon1"><hi

                                    exact needs would have to be recalculated in the light of
                                    decisions on military matters reached at the Conference. The
                                    non-munitions requirements had been put at 3 billion dollars
                                    gross against which a considerable amount would be set off for
                                    reverse Lend/Lease. The President agreed that it would be better
                                    to work on figures like these than on a proportional basis.</p>
                                <p>The Prime Minister emphasized that all these supplies should be
                                    on Lease/Lend. The President said this would naturally be
                                    so.</p>
                                <p>The Prime Minister pointed out that if the United Kingdom was
                                    once more to pay its way it was essential that the export trade,
                                    which had shrunk to a very small fraction, should be
                                    re-established. Naturally no articles obtained on Lend/Lease or
                                    identical thereto would be exported;<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2"
                                            ><p>On the source text the words “or sold for profit”
                                            have been inserted between the word “exported” and the
                                            semicolon. The words “or sold” are clearly in
                                            Roosevelt’s handwriting, and the words “for profit” may
                                            be in his handwriting also. (Morgenthau told members of
                                            his staff in Washington on September 19 that the
                                            “President wrote in his own handwriting that they
                                            couldn’t export or sell for profit”. See Morgenthau
                                            Diary, vol. 772.) The change is initialed in the left
                                            margin by both Roosevelt and Churchill and in the right
                                            margin by Churchill only.</p>
                                        <p>It is not entirely clear exactly when the words “or sold
                                            for profit” were added to the text. From Morgenthau’s
                                            diary entry for September 15 (<hi rend="italic"
                                                >post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_361">p. 361</ref>), it
                                            would appear that Roosevelt suggested inserting all four
                                            words during his meeting with Churchill which began at
                                            noon on September 15. From an explanation which
                                            Morgenthau gave to a group of American officials in
                                            Washington on September 20, however, it would appear
                                            that the words were added in two stages and that
                                            Morgenthau “went back” to the President twice regarding
                                            them. The verbatim report of this explanation is as

                                                  politically it would be unwise. He first said
                                                  ‘identical thereto would be exported.’ They asked
                                                  him what he meant. He said ‘exported or sold.’
                                                  That wasn’t clear. Then he said, ‘exported or sold
                                                  for profit.’ That wasn’t clear. They wanted me to
                                                  [go] back a third time and I refused to. I said we
                                                  would exchange letters on it. I said we wanted

                                                  wouldn’t go back a third time.” (Morgenthau Diary,

                                        20, 1944, “that the President was about to approve of the
                                        request which the British made for lend-lease aid when he
                                        [Morgenthau] interposed and recommended that a committee be
                                        appointed to consider the matter. The Secretary [Morgenthau]
                                        pointed out that he was successful in getting the matter
                                        turned over to a committee though the committee would have
                                        to act in accord with the oral conversations between
                                        Roosevelt and Churchill on the matter. The Secretary said
                                        that if he had not been there that a decision would have
                                        been made right there, without being referred to a
                                        committee.” (Memorandum by White, printed in <ref

                                    this purpose on an informal basis in the first instance which
                                    could be formalized in due course. Pending its report the United
                                    States departments should be instructed not to take action which
                                    would pre-judge the committee’s conclusions, e.g., production
                                    should not be closed down without reference to Lend/Lease
                                    supplies which it might be held should be supplied to Britain.
                                    The President thought that the committee should be set up and
                                    suggested that Mr. Morgenthau should head it representing him,
                                    and that Mr. Stettinius, who had taken such a large part in

                                <p>At some time during the Second Quebec Conference White discussed
                                    with Weeks the desirability of making certain information
                                    available to the United States authorities in order to expedite
                                    a decision with respect to lend-lease to the United Kingdom. The
                                    only information found on this discussion is that contained in
                                    the verbatim minutes of a conference between British and United
                                    States officials held in Washington at 3 p.m., September 20,

                                            initialed and finally he burst out: ‘What do you want me
                                            to do? Get on my hind legs and beg like Fala?’”

                                            speaking to him about our desire to have our Chiefs of
                                            Staff confer with his Chiefs of Staff. He said: By all
                                            means. We were allies. That would be expected. I then
                                            said to him that as he knew we were prepared to
                                            participate in the war in the Pacific against Japan but
                                            that we felt it must be in the Northern or Central
                                            regions. The President said he thought we should have a
                                            token representation but indicated that nothing might be
                                            needed for some time. He spoke of some extremely
                                            Northern region and indicated that toward the end, the
                                            Japanese might have to be driven out of the northern end
                                            of China. There was a hint that our men might be useful
                                            there. The President said I think Canada should have a
                                            token force to march into Berlin. I said I thought they
                                            would appreciate that and that it would be expected;
                                            that part of our army would be associated with the
                                            American and British armies. It was in this connection
                                            that the President referred to token forces in the other
                                            connection. The President made some reference to Russia
                                            and I asked him direct what part Russia would likely
                                            play. He repeated to me what had been said the other

                                    paragraphs of this memorandum relates to the Roosevelt-Churchill
                                    dinner on September 14, but since Leahy is not known to have
                                    been present, part of it may also relate to other conversations
                                    or meetings.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Captain Hughes Hallett</hi> pointed out that
                                    landing craft were originally made available in the theater for
                                    combatant operations only and were not to be kept as a
                                    convenience for incidental shipment of supplies after the
                                    assault and combatant phases were over.</p>

                                    of excess escort carriers for use in connection with ferrying
                                    aircraft. He said that all of the British escort carriers would
                                    be in use constantly until at least the summer of 1945.</p>

                                    However, he would make a particular note of this point.</p>

                                    Theater if it was thought they could be used.</p>

                                    exception to the scheme which proposed a German Disarmament
                                    Commission which consisted of three generals. He said he
                                    believed there should be a committee of nine: 3 generals, 3
                                    admirals, and 3 air officers, each responsible in his own zone
                                    for disarmament but who would act as a central committee to
                                    decide general questions.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral King</hi> said that the U.S. Navy
                                    would take over such ports as they were using, providing a Port
                                    Director and staff. However, he did not want any elaborate
                                    organization set up.</p>
                                <p>With regard to minesweeping, <hi rend="smallcaps">The First Sea
                                        Lord</hi> said that he expected the Germans would be

                                    the disarmament of Germany.</p>

                                        rend="smallcaps">The First Sea Lord</hi> agreed that further
                                    investigation is needed of the desirability of having separate
                                    organizations for naval disarmament and control of bases and
                                    ports but that this may be a logical solution. Both agreed that
                                    if the British are to control northwest Germany, the British
                                    will invite the U.S. Navy to participate in naval disarmament in
                                    this zone.</p>

                                    memorandum which they were to give to Churchill. The Secretary
                                    felt that the memorandum went too far in the wrong direction. He
                                    said he thought it represented “two steps backwards.” The
                                    Secretary said they ought to begin where Churchill left off and
                                    go forward. In the first conversation Churchill had been shocked
                                    by the proposal but on the following day he seemed to accept the
                                    program designed to weaken German economy. The memorandum ought
                                    to take that for granted. Churchill had already spoken of
                                    diverting Germany to an agricultural state as she was in the
                                    last quarter of the 19th Century. The Secretary thought that
                                    rather than present too inadequate a memorandum they ought to go
                                    back that afternoon and raise the question again with Churchill
                                    and the President and write the memorandum <pb n="360"
                                        xml:id="pg_360" facs="0420"/>on the conversation that will
                                    have taken place that afternoon rather than on the previous
                                    day.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary then spoke to Cherwell about Brand. He told him
                                    that he hadn’t wanted him to come to Washington to represent the
                                    British Treasury in the first place but that when he did come he
                                    gave him a chance, and that he was not helping England by his
                                    behavior. The Secretary mentioned Playfair and White suggested
                                    Opie or Keynes as possible Treasury representatives.</p>

                                                lend-lease matters during their meeting at 11:30

                                            was that where it read, ‘Naturally no articles obtained
                                            on Lend-Lease or identical thereto would be exported,’
                                            he included the words, ‘or sold’. Lord Cherwell said
                                            that they do sell all of their Lend-Lease; that is, all
                                            of the nonmilitary Lend-Lease, and the President then
                                            added the words also ‘for profit’.</p>
                                        <p>“Churchill was quite emotional about this agreement, and
                                            at one time he had tears in his eyes. When the thing was
                                            finally signed, he told the President how grateful he
                                            was, thanked him most effusively, and said that this was
                                            something they were doing for both countries.</p>
                                        <p>“Then Churchill, turning to Lord Cherwell and myself,
                                            said, ‘Where are the minutes on this matter of the
                                                Ruhr?’<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">Churchill was
                                                inquiring for a record of the discussion of German

                                                prepared but which was not produced in response to
                                                Churchill’s request because of Morgenthau’s
                                                objections to it.</note> and according to our
                                            agreement we said that we didn’t have them. The reason
                                            we didn’t have them was because I felt, when I read the
                                            minutes which Lord Cherwell had written, that it
                                            presented much too weak a case, and I thought that we
                                            could get Churchill to go much further. He seemed quite
                                            put out that we didn’t have the minutes of the previous
                                            meeting, and the President said that the reason we
                                            didn’t have them was because Henry interspersed the
                                            previous discussion with too many dirty stories, and
                                            that sort of broke the ice. So Churchill broke in and
                                            said, ‘Well, I’ll restate it,’ which he did, and he did
                                            it very forcefully and very clearly. Then he suggested
                                            that Lord Cherwell and I withdraw and try to do a job on
                                            dictating it, which we did. It only took us a few
                                            minutes, and we came back up to the room where they were
                                            meeting and just calmly walked in. When Churchill read
                                            our very short memorandum,<note n="4" xml:id="d197fn4"

                                            ‘No, this isn’t what I want.’ Then he started to talk
                                            and dictate to us, and I said, ‘I don’t know what the
                                            rules of the game are, but is there any reason why we
                                            can’t have a stenographer present? Then you could
                                            dictate directly to her.’ He said, ‘By all means,’ and
                                            Cherwell went out and got Churchill’s secretary, and she
                                            came in and he began to dictate. He dictated the
                                                memorandum,<note n="5" xml:id="d197fn5"><hi

                                                  466</ref>.</note> which finally stood just the way
                                            he dictated it. He dictates extremely well because he is
                                            accustomed to doing it when he is writing his books.</p>
                                        <p>“While Churchill was dictating, he used the memorandum
                                            which I had dictated as a sort of a text.</p>
                                        <p>“Roosevelt’s important contribution, while Churchill was
                                            dictating, was that when he got talking about the
                                            metallurgical, chemical and electric industries,
                                            Roosevelt had him insert the very important words ‘in
                                            Germany’. What Roosevelt meant was—because it came up
                                            later—that he didn’t have in mind just the Ruhr and the
                                            Saar, but he had in mind entire Germany, and that the
                                            matter we were talking about, namely, the ease with
                                            which metallurgical, chemical and electrical industries
                                            in Germany can be converted from peace to war, <pb

                                            apply to the Ruhr and the Saar, but the whole of
                                            Germany, which of course is terribly important.</p>
                                        <p>“When Churchill got through, Eden seemed quite shocked at
                                            what he heard, and he turned to Churchill and said, ‘You
                                            can’t do this. After all, you and I publicly have said
                                            quite the opposite. Furthermore, we have a lot of things
                                            in the work[s] in London which are quite different.’
                                            Then Churchill and Eden seemed to have quite a bit of
                                            argument about it. Roosevelt took no part in it, and I
                                            took a small part and kept throwing things in.
                                            Churchill’s main argument was what this meant in the way
                                            of trade; they would get the export trade of Germany. So
                                            Eden said, ‘How do you know what it is or where it is?’
                                            and Churchill answered him quite testily, ‘Well, we will
                                            get it where-ever it is.’ I was quite amazed and shocked
                                            at Eden’s attitude; in fact, it was so different from
                                            the way he talked when we were in London. Finally
                                            Churchill said, ‘Now I hope, Anthony, you’re not going
                                            to do anything about this with the War Cabinet if you
                                            see a chance to present it.’ Then he said this, ‘After
                                            all, the future of my people is at stake, and when I
                                            have to choose between my people and the German people,
                                            I am going to choose my people.’<note n="6"

                                        <p>“… On the morning of September 15th I joined the Prime
                                            Minister and the President, who were by now in agreement
                                            in their approval of the [Morgenthau] plan. Cherwell had
                                            supported Morgenthau and their joint advocacy had
                                            prevailed. Large areas of the Ruhr and the Saar were to
                                            be stripped of their manufacturing industries and turned
                                            into agricultural lands. It was as if one were to take
                                            the Black Country and turn it into Devonshire. I did not
                                            like the plan, nor was I convinced that it was to our
                                            national advantage.</p>
                                        <p>“I said so, and also suggested that Mr. Cordell Hull’s
                                            opinion should be sought for. This was the only occasion
                                            I can remember when the Prime Minister showed impatience
                                            with my views before foreign representatives. He
                                            resented my criticism of something which he and the
                                            President had approved, not I am sure on his account,
                                            but on the President’s.”</p>

                                <p>Cadogan told Stettinius in Washington on September 16, 1944, that
                                    Roosevelt and Churchill had discussed the question of voting in
                                    the Security Council of the proposed world organization at
                                    midday on September 15 and again in the middle of the afternoon.

                                            said that while Eden understood these matters clearly,
                                            Churchill had not yet studied them and [he] feared that
                                            neither Churchill nor the President had a complete
                                            understanding of what was involved. I inquired if he
                                            knew whether the President had had my message before him
                                            when this was discussed, and he said that the President
                                            had had no papers before him and did not refer to any.
                                            He said the question had come up at midday yesterday and
                                            had been discussed again in the middle of the afternoon.
                                            He did not indicate which person had taken the

                                                telephone conversation on September 17 that
                                                Roosevelt “had tried to get Mr. Churchill interested
                                                in this subject, but that the Prime Minister took
                                                the position that he had not studied the papers and
                                                did not have the time to get into it.”</note> He
                                            indicated that the President had not been definite in

                                    during this meeting. Mackenzie King apparently came to the
                                    Citadel for the purpose of asking Roosevelt and Churchill to
                                    accept honorary degrees from McGill University (see Pickersgill

                                            were prepared to operate in the central area as well.
                                            Churchill also indicated that we were prepared to go as

                                    date that Roosevelt and Churchill had reached agreement during
                                    the afternoon on the allocation of zones of occupation in
                                    Germany as between United States and British forces—a matter
                                    which had been left undecided in the protocol defining the
                                    boundaries of the three zones of occupation in Germany which had
                                    been signed at London on September 12 by the representatives on
                                    the European Advisory Commission of the United States, the
                                    United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union (see <hi rend="italic"

                                    which he presented to the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff

                                    agreement, as reflected in the Leahy memorandum, (1) assigned
                                    the south western zone of occupation in Germany to United States
                                    forces and the northwestern zone to British forces; (2) changed
                                    the boundary between the two zones by transferring the province
                                    of Hessen–Nassau and Oberhessen from the northwestern to the
                                    southwestern zone and by transferring an area west of the Rhine
                                    comprising Saarland, the Palatinate, and Rheinhessen from the
                                    southwestern to the northwestern zone; and (3) provided that
                                    United States forces would have access “through the western and

                                                  said that he had discussed with the President the
                                                  allocation of zones of occupation in Germany
                                                  between ourselves and the Americans. The
                                                  President’s main anxiety was to arrange the zones
                                                  so that the American area was not anywhere in
                                                  direct contact with French territory and so that
                                                  the American lines of communication with their
                                                  zone need not pass through France. The President
                                                  had roughly outlined his suggestion on a map which
                                                  the Prime Minister showed to the Chiefs of
                                                  Staff.</p>
                                                <p>“The British were to have the zone comprising
                                                  North-Western Germany and a strip stretching right
                                                  up the right bank of the Rhine. The Americans were
                                                  to have South-Western Germany extending Northwards
                                                  roughly to a line due East of Coblenz.</p>
                                                <p>“It was agreed that the President’s proposal was,
                                                  in principle, acceptable to us. In effect it gave
                                                  us the North-West zone, as at present proposed,
                                                  together with the Westmark area and the Province
                                                  of the Lorraine until this was taken over by the
                                                  French; and gave the Americans the South-West zone
                                                  (as at present proposed) together with the
                                                  Province of Hessen–Nassau. It should be possible
                                                  to arrange for the lines of communication to the
                                                  American zone to enter through Amsterdam and
                                                  Rotterdam and pass down the Rhine. It was,
                                                  however, quite likely that the Americans would ask
                                                  for the use, in addition, of one of the German
                                                  ports. The President’s proposal would require a
                                                  detailed examination from the administrative point
                                                  of view, and it might later on be necessary to
                                                  make some small adjustments in the boundaries.</p>

                                        a letter to the Director of the Historical Office,
                                        Department of State, dated April 30, 1971, stated that the
                                        question of occupation zones in Austria was also discussed
                                        during his meeting with Roosevelt at Quebec. “Here the
                                        problem which arose was particularly the question, whether
                                        Austria’s occupation should be made in several zones or only
                                        in two zones, namely a Russian and an Anglo-American. In
                                        this connection I had also talks with Mr. Churchill, who
                                        like myself favoured the establishment of a number of zones
                                        in Austria due to the fact that it would thus be possible to
                                        diminish the Soviet influence with the Central government.
                                        President Roosevelt, who at first was more in favour of a
                                        temporary occupation in two zones, which he considered as a
                                        very short and passing phase, agreed that probably in view
                                        of future Austrian independence the solution, of several
                                        zones would be better.” (POL 32–3 AUS/4–30–71)</note>

                                        <p>“The remainder of the conversation was rather disjointed,
                                            as is the custom with R., and each problem was touched
                                            upon repeatedly. The following is a summary of what was
                                            said on the various points:</p>
                                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi>. This was evidently one
                                            of the cardinal issues of the conversation. R. kept
                                            coming back to this problem time and again. Apart from
                                            the President’s personal sympathy for Hungary, the main
                                            reason for this is probably the hope of making Hungary a
                                            bulwark against Russia. He stressed that he wished
                                            Hungary would make an unconditional surrender only to
                                            the Americans and British. If this were done, Hungary
                                            could be saved from communism. Hungary would surely
                                            receive mild terms. Military operations are now being
                                            planned which are designed to make it possible for the
                                            Hungarians to establish liaison with the civilized
                                            Allies. In the course of the discussion, R. took up the
                                            idea of having the Hungarian envoys act as transmitters
                                            of his proposal for Hungary. Specific mention was made
                                            of Apor, whom he would approach through Myron Taylor.
                                            His former sympathy for Horthy had been forfeited
                                            through the latter’s weakness and senility. He was very
                                            receptive to the idea that we might perhaps be helpful

                                            agreed that I would immediately send him a message for
                                            the Hungarian government. He also asked in detail about
                                            Béla Kun, concerning whose atrocious deeds he was well
                                            informed. Attempts had also been made to prejudice him
                                            very strongly against Mihály Károlyi, but obviously he
                                            does not know much about him.</p>
                                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Russia</hi>. It is evident that the
                                            relationship between R. and the Russians is strained.
                                            While the President emphasized that he liked Stalin
                                            personally—although he said a little later that he was
                                                ‘<hi rend="italic">untrustworthy</hi>’ and deceitful
                                            (my personal impression: the praise of Stalin was merely
                                            a gesture to put a little damper on our joy, and so was
                                            not genuine)—the President was bitterly critical of the
                                            men around Stalin. All the men around Stalin were old
                                            Bolsheviks whom one could not trust. There was a general
                                            interest in keeping the Russians away as far as
                                            possible. R. seems to have been particularly disgusted
                                            by Russia’s handling of the Bulgarian question. It is
                                            obvious that the Anglo-Saxons were tricked by the
                                            Russians. From all of R.’s remarks it is quite evident
                                            that he is afraid of the Communists and wants to do
                                            everything to contain Russia’s power—naturally <hi

                                            will be restored and efforts will be made to protect the
                                            country from Bolshevism. The question whether Austria
                                            would want to form a federation with South Germany was
                                            raised at the Conference, but R. said that this should
                                            be left to the Austrians themselves. He thought that the
                                            Austrians would not care for that. When he asked for my
                                            opinion, I said that Austria would primarily wish to
                                            associate with the Danube countries, especially Hungary,
                                            but if Hungary were to fall into the hands of the
                                            Russians, Austria might consider a union with Catholic
                                            South Germany on the condition that Vienna would be the
                                            capital. German, R. remarked at this point, would be
                                            divided into three parts, North, West, and South
                                            Germany. R. apparently had no knowledge of the Hull
                                            Declaration. He shared our opinion that an uprising
                                            would be far too premature <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369"

                                            Austrian underground did not seem to interest him
                                            greatly. He seems to think that the underground is so
                                            strong that nothing needs to be done for it except
                                            supply it with arms at the last moment. South Tyrol was
                                            discussed with him. He is sympathetic to our efforts. It
                                            is not clear, however, whether anything has been done in
                                            this respect. He has reports from Italy about the
                                            present Italian government: they are relatively
                                            unconcerned about any territorial questions regarding
                                            Austria, they are interested in only one thing: they
                                            want to keep Trieste. He has proposed, and the proposal
                                            seems to have been accepted, that Trieste, Pola, and
                                            Fiume become free ports under international guarantee
                                            and administration. (The same régime, by the way, is
                                            also planned for the German ports.)</p>

                                            having the United Nations meet the end of October, and
                                            he said that he felt it had taken much too long to bring
                                            up the League of Nations after World War I, and he
                                            wanted to do this in October. So I said, ‘Well, it makes
                                            good window dressing for the campaign,’ and he said,
                                            ‘Yes.’ His idea is to have it about the 27th of October
                                            and run through and after election.</p>

                                                meeting at noon on September 15, it seems probable
                                                that the discussion recorded here, about notifying
                                                Stalin, took place during Morgenthau’s meeting with
                                                Roosevelt on the evening of that day.</note>—I said,
                                            ‘Look, Mr. President, now that we have this Ruhr and
                                            Saar stuff straightened out, the thing should be
                                            presented to Stalin, and I think if Stalin knew how we
                                            felt you would find he would act much better.’ The
                                            President said, ‘Well, I will have Harriman come back
                                            and explain it to him, and let him go back and sell it
                                            to Stalin.’ ‘Listen,’ I said, ‘Harriman can’t do this.
                                            You ought to send me.’ I said, ‘I get along very well
                                            with the Russians, and you could check with Stalin as to
                                            whether I do or whether I don’t.’ The President said,
                                            ‘Oh, I have far too important things for you to do
                                            around Washington. I can’t spare you for a thing like
                                            this.’ I said, ‘Well, it would only be a matter of 10
                                            days.’ He thought a minute and said, ‘Well, it might
                                            take two weeks,’ and he seemed to like the idea. . .

                                            exported or sold for profit’, and he wanted it, ‘would
                                            be exported and sold’, I think. He wanted to change it,
                                            anyway.</p>
                                        <p>“I said I just wouldn’t go back. I went back once and got
                                            the ‘or sold,’ and the President said, ‘for profit.’

                                <p>On September 20 Morgenthau told a group of American officials:
                                    “They wanted me to [go] back a third time and I refused to. I
                                    said we would exchange letters on it. I said we wanted them to
                                    continue as they have in the past, but I wouldn’t go back a
                                    third time. And he [Cherwell] wrote me this letter …”

                                    presentation to the British. He had outlined the British and
                                    United States areas and had included remarks on the necessity
                                    for access to northwestern sea ports and passage through the

                                    replied that one port would be enough provided the United States

                                    to handle approximately 10,000 tons of supplies daily.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral King</hi> agreed with this proposal.
                                    American control of the port of Bremen would have to include

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Cunningham</hi> agreed. He suggested
                                    that the American area should also include Bremerhaven, some 40
                                    or 50 miles down the river. Bremerhaven was, he understood, the

                                    authorities could see their way to assisting the operations in
                                    Burma with one or two divisions it would be better to move two
                                    divisions from the later schedules of the United States Army
                                    transportation to Europe than to take two divisions from General
                                    Montgomery’s Army which was now actually fighting. This would
                                    bring additional troops more rapidly into action against the
                                    Japanese without withdrawing any of those already fighting in
                                    Germany. He did not ask for a decision on these proposals there
                                    and then but asked if the United States Chiefs of Staff would
                                    examine his suggestion.</p>

                                    the Prime Minister’s proposals. He said, however, that there was
                                    only one light division available and this had been reorganized
                                    and allocated to the European Theater at the special request of
                                    General Eisenhower. Every division in the United States was
                                    already allocated either to General Eisenhower or to the

                                    United States divisions for Burma was by taking them from

                                <p>No official memorandum has been found relating to the discussion
                                    during this luncheon meeting. Mackenzie King’s notes indicate
                                    that he had a conversation at lunch with Roosevelt, Churchill,
                                    and Eden, concerning the advisability of convening the proposed
                                    international conference on world organization on October 30,
                                    just a week before the presidential elections in the United
                                    States. Mackenzie King spoke of the opposition there would be
                                    from small countries, including Canada, to any appearance that
                                    the great powers were “seeking to control the world in the
                                    organization of its affairs”. Churchill referred to the
                                    disagreement with Stalin on the duties and powers of the Council
                                    of the proposed organization in settling disputes, especially
                                    with regard to a Soviet right to a veto even in disputes to
                                    which the Soviet Union was a party. For the text of Mackenzie

                                    pp. 86–87., Eden, p. 554, records that Churchill explained to
                                    Roosevelt at this meeting why Eden could not accept the
                                    President’s invitation to visit Hyde Park.</p>

                                    Roosevelt Papers. Roosevelt first reviewed in very general terms
                                    the work of the Second Quebec Conference, expressed hope for the
                                    surrender of Germany, and discussed joint action against Japan
                                    and logistic problems in the Pacific. He stated specifically
                                    that questions of command in the Pacific War had not been
                                    discussed, and he described the division of responsibility among
                                    Mountbatten, MacArthur, and Nimitz. Churchill then commented on
                                    the results of the Conference and on British and Canadian
                                    participation in the war against Japan. Mackenzie King made
                                    brief closing remarks. For a substantively complete text of the

                                    it is indicated that the Foreign Secretary said goodbye to
                                    Roosevelt alone after the press conference of September 16,
                                    1944. The President told Eden that he would visit England at the
                                    end of November whether he won or lost the election.<note n="1"

                            <p>As you say, the elimination of the restrictive practices of cartels
                                is an objective that consistently follows from the liberal
                                principles of international trade which this Government, under your
                                direction, has constantly sought to implement through the trade
                                agreement program and other aspects of commercial policy. It is also
                                an objective which consistently follows from this country’s
                                traditional and long-standing program designed to protect the
                                consumer against monopoly and to preserve individual enterprise on a
                                freely competitive basis.</p>
                            <p>For more than a year the Department, together with other interested
                                agencies, has been giving careful attention to the issues which you
                                mention, as well as other related subjects. An interdepartmental
                                committee was established at my suggestion, and has been giving
                                constant and current consideration to cartel matters and the methods
                                by which the objectives set forth in your letter may best be
                                achieved and most appropriately be coordinated with other facets of
                                our foreign economic policy.</p>
                            <p>I shall continue to follow closely the progress of this work on the
                                subject of international cartels, and I am bringing your letter and
                                my reply to the attention of the Executive Committee on Economic
                                Foreign Policy with the request that this Committee and its
                                subsidiary units expedite their work so as to be ready on short

                                        Morgenthau and Cherwell then returned to the meeting of the

                            <p>At a conference between the President and the Prime Minister, Mr.
                                Churchill said that he would sum up the discussion that we had been
                                having in regard to the future disposition of the Ruhr and the Saar.
                                Pie said that they would permit Russia and any other of our Allies
                                to help themselves to whatever machinery they wished, that the
                                industries in the Ruhr and in the Saar would be shut down, and that
                                these two districts would be put under an international body which
                                would supervise these industries to see that they would not start up
                                again.</p>
                            <p>This progamme for eliminating the war-making industries in the Ruhr
                                and in the Saar is part of a programme looking forward to diverting
                                Germany into largely an agricultural country.</p>
                            <p>The Prime Minister and the President were in agreement upon this
                                programme.</p>

                                Argentina—Meat Negotiations</p>
                            <p>It is no exaggeration to say that effective implementation of our
                                Argentine policy depends on British cooperation in economic matters.
                                Up to the present we have received only tentative and highly
                                qualified promises from London to investigate the possibility of
                                such cooperation.</p>
                            <p>As you know, we have considered that it is of the greatest importance
                                that if the British ultimately find it necessary to sign a meat
                                contract rather than to purchase on a month-to-month or spot basis,
                                such contract should be for the shortest possible term. However, the
                                rumor has persisted that the British intend to sign a four-year
                                contract and Mr. Eden has now written to Ambassador Winant stating
                                among other things that <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        acutely difficult post-war years, they shall be adequately
                                        fed; and the case made out by our Ministry of Food that only
                                        a longer term contract will ensure this as regards meat is

                            <p>In view of the situation developing on food surpluses as pointed out

                                    xml:id="d221fn4">Not printed (Roosevelt Papers).</note> it would
                                appear that longer term commitments with the Argentine could be
                                avoided. As Judge Byrnes has indicated, “Production in the areas
                                under Allied control with the exception of Russia is approximately
                                one third above normal production. War reserves have been
                                established. When peace comes the reserves in the military theatres
                                will become surplus.”</p>
                            <p>With respect to meat specifically, which the Combined Food Board may
                                consider in relatively short supply, although it has not as yet <pb

                                supply for the period November [1944] to November 1945, it appears
                                that with the overall ample food situation, that some provision
                                could be made for supplying additional meat to the United Kingdom
                                from the United States, Canada, Australia and South American
                                countries other than Argentina. I understand that there is a surplus
                                of utility beef in the United States and with the current prospects
                                of slaughter this fall that the surplus undoubtedly will be
                                increased. It is also my understanding that there may be some
                                surplus of commercial grades of beef. It may be possible for us to
                                arrange to increase lend-lease of certain quantities of utility and
                                commercial grades of beef to the United Kingdom provided a similar

                                    report referred to is not printed.</note> that the British
                                Ministry of Food has informed the Argentine government that the
                                British are disposed to sign a new contract for two years at the
                                same prices as the current contract. The contract would be on the
                                same basis as that recently concluded with New Zealand and Australia
                                so that Britain would buy the entire exportable surplus for four
                                years with prices subject to re-examination at the end of two years.
                                The Embassy adds that this word from London came as a great relief
                                to the Colonels.</p>
                            <p>I regret to say that it has become increasingly clear that the
                                British continue to treat the Argentine Fascist threat as a matter
                                of minor and relatively unimportant policy. To us it is a matter of
                                major policy. If we fail in the implementation of that policy, the
                                Nazis will have a powerful center to renew their fight in this
                                Hemisphere economically, politically and eventually in a military
                                way. This would mean inevitably the destruction of all that we have
                                been trying to build since 1933.</p>
                            <p>In view of our enormous aid to the British on supply matters, it is
                                certainly not asking too much to request that they forego the petty
                                commercial advantages of a long term bargain with a Fascist
                                government. It is hard to believe that they will permit the
                                Argentines to succeed in the “divide and conquer” tactics they are
                                so obviously employing in the matter of the meat contract. As I have
                                said time and again, the political implications of these meat
                                negotiations are really tremendous. If they are concluded, as the
                                Argentines hope they will be, their position will be greatly
                                fortified and our own position correspondingly weakened throughout
                                the Hemisphere.</p>

                                    “Without attempting a precise restatement, I have assumed that
                                    the agreed principles which have heretofore governed the sale or

                                    would be retained unless changed circumstances should make
                                    reconsideration desirable. In the latter event the subject could
                                    be reopened for discussion between our two Governments.”

                            <p>1. The United States and British Chiefs of Staff agree that it is
                                necessary to create additional machinery through which the military
                                    <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0464"/>efforts of the United
                                Nations forces on the European fronts may be coordinated. The form
                                of this machinery is considered below.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">facts bearing on the
                                problem</hi></p>
                            <p>2. Close liaison is needed between the Combined Chiefs of Staff and
                                the Soviet General Staff on matters of strategy and military policy
                                in Europe. It will, moreover, be highly desirable to open
                                discussions with the U.S.S.R. on the war against Japan as early as
                                politically practicable.</p>
                            <p>3. In June 1944 Marshal Stalin raised the question of improving the
                                machinery for coordinating the military efforts of the Allies, and
                                in July, Marshal Vassilievsky informed General Deane that the Soviet
                                General Staff were interested in the matter and would like to know
                                the proposals of the Chiefs of Staff in this respect.<note n="4"

                                Staff and the Soviet General Staff would be achieved by the creation
                                of a Combined British, United States and Soviet Committee in Moscow,
                                provided that it is clearly understood that this Committee:— <list>

                                    <item>Deals solely with strategic and operational matters and
                                        does not impinge upon the work that is at present being done
                                        by the European Advisory Commission, such as civil affairs,
                                        etc.</item>
                                </list>

                            <p>6. On the Russian side there has been reluctance in the past to
                                discuss matters of any importance with the British and United States
                                Missions, owing to the fact that the latter have usually to deal
                                with officials of no authoritative standing. This difficulty should
                                be overcome in the future provided that the Russian representative
                                on the Committee is a senior member of the Russian General Staff.
                                The Heads of the United States and British Missions already
                                represent their own Chiefs of Staff and so might well serve as
                                members of the Committee. Their rank should be similar to that of
                                the Russian Member.</p>

                                approval to be given by the Red Army General Staff. General Spaatz
                                was informed of approval and as a result the mission is now

                            <p>Soviet Government informed British Government that they were prepared
                                to cooperate with British and Americans in organizing aid to Warsaw
                                provided this aid is rendered in accordance with a prearranged
                                plan.</p>
                            <p>General Marshall has directed me and the President has directed Mr.
                                Harriman to assist in working out a plan with the Russians and
                                British. Burrows and I informed the Red Army General Staff that we
                                wish to meet with them at once to work out a plan in which all three
                                countries participate. So far there has been no Soviet reply. With
                                the Red Army in Praga, the battle for Warsaw is reaching its
                                critical and conclusive stages. In all probability American
                                participation in relief of Polish insurgents will be limited to
                                    <gloss target="#t_Frantic1"><hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Frantic</hi></gloss> 7; however, both the Ambassador and I feel
                                that it would be a great mistake to start reduction of <gloss
                                    target="#t_Escom1"><hi rend="smallcaps">Escom</hi></gloss> bases
                                until the Warsaw situation has been clarified. It may develop that
                                an additional American dropping mission will be a critical necessity
                                and if so the facilities in Russia should remain available. The
                                Ambassador feels that politically we would be in a most
                                disadvantageous position if we had made additional missions
                                impossible before the battle for Warsaw is decided or if we even
                                gave the Russians the impression that we had abandoned the
                                insurgents in Warsaw by initiating preparations to reduce <gloss

                                102. Premier Mikołajczyk has requested me to transmit the following
                                appeal of the Council of National Unity in Warsaw addressed to the
                                President, Mr. Churchill and Marshal Stalin, dated September 15th
                                and received in London today: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“On the forty-fifth day of the struggle of the people of

                                        witnessing the first signs of effective assistance in the
                                        form of air cover and dropping of arms and food, the Council
                                        of National Unity affirm that this has brought great relief
                                        to Warsaw.<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">The reference is to a

                                    <p>The Council of National Unity stress the inflexible will of
                                        the people of Warsaw and of Poland to fight the Germans unto
                                        the end for the freedom and independence of Poland. To carry
                                        on this fight it is indispensable to supply the soldiers of
                                        the home army. The Council of National Unity therefore
                                        fervently appeal for continuous dropping of arms, ammunition
                                        and food, for permanent air cover to be organized and for
                                        the bombing of German concentrations and military
                                        objectives. The enemy is attacking the city with
                                        continuously reinforced formations. The lack of quick and
                                        effective succor may cause a catastrophe.”</p>

                                        information received from the United States Mission at
                                        Algiers, were as follows: <list>
                                            <item>“1. Eritrea would be dismembered with the western
                                                highlands going to the Sudan and the highlands and
                                                Danakil coastal plain to Ethiopia. It is assumed
                                                that the United Nations would not request a base at
                                                Massawa. A greater new Somaliland would be created
                                                including Italian Somaliland, the northern frontier
                                                district of Kenya and British and Ethiopian Ogaden

                                            <item>“2. Cyrenaica would be an autonomous principality

                                                a useful bargaining counter.</item>
                                            <item>“3. Tripolitania would be restored to Italy

                                            <item>“4. There would be frontier readjustments with the

                            <p>I may add that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have expressed the view that
                                from the limited viewpoint of our national security, there are no
                                direct objections to the British proposals for the disposition of
                                Italian overseas territories since United States postwar military

                                    Disposition of Italian Overseas Territories</p>
                                <p>1. The preferred solution to the problem of Eritrea is for all of
                                    this territory to be assimilated to Ethiopia under an
                                    arrangement whereby the Ethiopian Government would assume
                                    certain obligations by agreement with the International
                                    Organization. Among these obligations would be an undertaking by
                                    Ethiopia, in the event of a threat to the security of the Red
                                    Sea or Northeast African areas, to open all ports, airfields and
                                    means of communication in Eritrea to the forces of the United
                                    Nations. Such obligations would also include the employment, in
                                    both Eritrea and Ethiopia, of technical personnel for the
                                    operation of ports, railways and roads, and of technical experts
                                    and advisers in the central and provincial government and
                                    administration.</p>
                                <p>This arrangement would satisfy the claims of Ethiopia for the
                                    return of Eritrea and for an outlet to the sea at Massawa, under
                                    safeguards for proper administration and with due regard for the
                                    security interests of the United Nations. However, if the
                                    British should insist, for overriding strategic reasons, on the
                                    dismemberment of Eritrea, so that a portion of the territory
                                    would be ceded to the Sudan, no objections are perceived strong
                                    enough to justify the opposition of this Government, provided
                                    that the area ceded lies north and west of Asmara and
                                    Massawa.</p>
                                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Greater New Somaliland</hi> as proposed by
                                    the British would include Italian and British Somaliland and the
                                    Ogaden district of Ethiopia. Since the Ogaden is an integral
                                    part of the territory of an <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410"
                                        facs="0472"/>independent sovereign state and ally, a change
                                    in its status should not be considered. On the other hand,
                                    economic, administrative and cultural considerations support the
                                    view that Italian Somaliland, together with the British and
                                    French Somalilands, might advantageously be placed under
                                    International Trusteeship and directly administered as a single
                                    unit by an authority appointed by and responsible to the
                                    International Organization. Such an authority should be composed
                                    of experts or of representatives of the interested powers. If it
                                    should prove impossible to obtain French acceptance of this
                                    plan, it would still appear desirable to place Italian and
                                    British Somalilands under International Trusteeship, with
                                    special arrangements for a genuinely free port at Djibouti and
                                    the possible purchase of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway by
                                    Ethiopia.</p>
                                <p>No objection is perceived to the fusion of the northern frontier

                                    Libya would be to place this entire area (Cyrenaica and

                                    by a commission of experts responsible to the International
                                    Organization. This would not preclude the establishment of an
                                    autonomous Amirate of the Senussi, whom the British have
                                    declared shall never again come under Italian rule.<note n="6"

                                    less desirable arrangement would be to establish Cyrenaica as an
                                    autonomous Senussi Amirate under Egyptian (or possibly British)
                                    trusteeship, along the lines of the British proposal, and to

                                    naval requirements would be satisfied in the Benghazi area.
                                    Likewise, should Great Britain wish to use the Castel Benito
                                    airfield for security purposes, there would be no objection,

                            <p>313. For the President and the Secretary.</p>
                            <p>My greatest present concern is that with the completion of Italian
                                National Committee for the Distribution of Italian Relief the
                                material ‘accumulated in America will not be available in Italy
                                through failure to ship according to schedule. First shipment should
                                now have arrived. If not delivered reaction damaging to prestige we
                                have built up will be very unfortunate. Reported statements from
                                America indicate intention of substantial and adequate relief for
                                Italy is the policy of our government. While we in America
                                understand the shipping difficulties, the people in distress do not.
                                Would it be possible to allocate one or two ships for strictly
                                relief voyages with standard cargoes of staples and essentials and
                                keep them constantly en route bringing relief to stricken
                                populations? It seems to me with such vessels loaded at a given port
                                in America and destined for convenient ports in Italy, a minimum of
                                time would be lost in loading and unloading and the delays and
                                complications resulting from mixed cargoes, munitions and other
                                vital products would be avoided. A simple plan of this character
                                would seem deserving of careful study.</p>

                            <p>It seems to me that there are great advantages to be accrued to us if
                                you can take the initiative and get Churchill’s approval to a course
                                of action which you would announce publicly.</p>
                            <p>The machinery for getting quick action relative to immediate relief
                                and the purchase of material for economic rehabilitation is
                                available. The Italians can pay for all of the goods to be bought in
                                this country, other than emergency relief supplies, out of funds
                                which would accrue to them from our soldiers’ pay.</p>
                            <p>The Prisoner of War business, I think, should be cleared up just as
                                soon as possible and, of equal importance, is the obvious necessity

                                        The White House</hi></p>
                                <p>I refer to Mr. Jones’ conversation with you Monday morning,
                                    September 11.</p>
                                <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0475"/>
                                <p>American, policy toward Italy is based upon our desire to see
                                    that nation return to political and economic independence and
                                    stability as quickly as possible. We do not believe that Italy
                                    will contribute to an orderly and peaceful Europe if it is
                                    subject to any one of its more powerful neighbors. This
                                    Government has specifically assured the Italian people the right
                                    to choose the form of government they may desire when they are
                                    in a position to exercise that right. Political independence for
                                    Italy, free from foreign domination, would seem to be implicit
                                    in this pledge.</p>
                                <p>The economic well-being of a country is the prime factor in its
                                    internal stability and its peaceful relations with other states.
                                    The economic dependence of one state upon another is not
                                    conducive to such well-being and may ultimately have undesirable
                                    political implications. Furthermore, since the United States is
                                    bearing the major share of the civilian supply quota for Italy,
                                    it is sound American policy to help Italy again become
                                    self-supporting and to regain a measure of economic independence
                                    at an early date.</p>
                                <p>In the immediate future increased civilian supplies, principally
                                    foodstuffs, are essential to prevent further deterioration in
                                    Italian public health and morale in the ever-increasing portions
                                    of liberated Italy. The three principal problems to be solved
                                    are: <list>

                                <p>A specific and sufficient allocation of shipping for civilian
                                    supplies should be obtained from the War Department or other
                                    United States agency.</p>
                                <p>Two thousand trucks are needed for the distribution of supplies
                                    for civilians in the present liberated area. Army trucks within
                                    the theater should be made available to the extent possible (not
                                    convenient) by the Supreme Allied Command. Once hostilities have
                                    ceased, a sufficient number of United States Army trucks and
                                    tractors in the theater could be made available for this purpose
                                    until the internal transportation system can be rehabilitated at
                                    least in a basic sense.</p>
                                <p>When the dollar equivalent of American troop pay spent in Italy,
                                    plus immigrant remittances and Italian exports to this country,
                                    is made available to the Italian Government, almost all the
                                    foreign exchange required for the purchase of civilian supplies
                                    in this country will be provided. (It is believed that this
                                    proposal is at present on the President’s desk, having received
                                    British concurrence, and could be put into effect immediately if
                                    approved.) Limited <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss>

                                    displaced persons of Italian nationality up to $50,000,000 is
                                    essential to supplement the civilian supply <pb n="414"
                                        xml:id="pg_414" facs="0476"/>program mentioned above. Every
                                    effort therefore should be made to assure that agreement to this
                                    proposal is given at the <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss>
                                    conference in Montreal this month.</p>
                                <p>As to the second phase of Italy’s economic problems, we should
                                    now make possible the primary rehabilitation of its agriculture
                                    and essential industries in order that the Italian nation can
                                    begin to be self-supporting again. Hence the Italian supply
                                    program should not be limited, as it has been so far, to
                                    consumers’ goods but should make available fertilizer, seeds,
                                    spare parts and essential raw materials to permit the resumption
                                    of Italian production for the nation’s basic consumers’ needs.
                                    This will require not only a sufficient shipping allocation but
                                    sufficient funds to finance such a program even on a limited
                                    scale. The United States’ funds to be made available to the
                                    Italian Government from troop pay, immigration remittances, et
                                    cetera, will probably not cover such an undertaking in addition
                                    to the consumers goods which must be purchased over the next
                                    year for immediate consumption by the population. The following
                                    additional methods of financing might prove feasible.</p>

                                    Nations in the war against Germany for almost a year. During
                                    that time the Italian Government—Armed Forces and people—have
                                    cooperated sincerely and to the best of their limited resources
                                    in the common fight. They have “worked their passage” to a
                                    considerable extent. The United States and Great Britain could
                                    revise Italian Armistice terms which have been rendered largely
                                    obsolete by the course of events, or we could conclude a
                                    preliminary peace treaty with Italy, terminating the state of
                                    war existing between it and the United Nations, postponing for

                                            under Italian command. A solution of this problem would

                                    agencies in Italy under my command of necessity have been
                                    directly related to support of military operations. Supplies

                                    economic rehabilitation have had the primary, if not the
                                    exclusive, purpose of utilizing Italy’s resources for the war
                                    effort and producing in Italy goods which would otherwise have

                                <item>In the light of the changed operational situation the limited
                                    directives which have governed seem no longer to be adequate.
                                    The Armistice agreement, under which the Allied Control
                                    Commission operates, contains no commitment to the Italian
                                    people as to any measure of material assistance. However, there
                                    has arisen in Italy the expectation, if not the assumption,
                                    presumably by reason of the known humanitarian policies of the
                                    two governments, that an additional measure of assistance and
                                    relief to the civil population would be forthcoming. Public
                                    utterances in both countries have tended to support this view.
                                    Moreover, if the two governments continue at this stage to
                                    consider only what is required in the interest of the war
                                    effort, they may lose the opportunity of ensuring one of their
                                    own long term interests, i.e., the establishment of a reasonably
                                    prosperous and contented Italy after the war. Notwithstanding
                                    this fact the standard of military necessity still obtains and
                                    in the provision of supply is being strictly adhered to. For
                                    example, a clothing programme was submitted in June (<gloss

                            <p>I should like to discuss with Anthony<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3"
                                    >Eden.</note> a suggestion that came up yesterday, namely, that
                                Mayor La Guardia should pay a visit to Italy as your representative,
                                and that while there he should be invited to attend the meetings of
                                the Allied Control Commission.<note n="4" xml:id="d242fn4">The
                                    suggested La Guardia mission had also been mentioned earlier, as
                                    it is referred to in a letter from Churchill to Roosevelt, at
                                    Quebec, dated September 12, 1944. See <hi rend="italic"

                                would have a chance to see that the machinery was working in the
                                manner most beneficial to the Italians. I have a series of other
                                proposals helpful to the Italians, on which I hope we shall be in
                                full agreement. I would run through these with you, perhaps
                                to-morrow, when Anthony will be here.</p>
                            <p>It is urgent to appoint Macmillan, because the post of Chief
                                Commissioner has been vacant for two months, and I am becoming
                                blameworthy in the matter, especially if any food shortage or

                            <p>Viewed as of the present date and position of the war, the memorandum
                                of July 15th means, in effect, a rejection of Monnet’s program and
                                would require the French to pay cash currently for all items not
                                required as necessary military aid. I do not think you intended, nor
                                would I recommend, so flat a position. On the other hand, you would
                                not wish to approve at this stage the French program, amounting as
                                it does to something over a billion dollars of industrial items to
                                be paid for on credit terms. I do not think that there is any
                                formula which describes what you may wish to approve and what you
                                may not wish to approve. What seems to me necessary is to leave in
                                your hands complete discretion to do what you may think necessary
                                from time to time in the light of French behavior.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, I recommend that you authorize us to provide that such
                                long-life articles and such other articles as may be included from

                                    President during the French negotiations on July 15 was designed
                                    to limit lend lease to France to the end of hostilities in
                                    Europe. Mr. McCloy and General Hilldring of the War Department
                                    have definitely stated that French industrial production will be
                                    of no help in fighting the war in Europe and that the help which

                                <item>The argument used to justify broadening the scope of the Lend
                                    Lease Agreement is that we should give the fullest discretion
                                    possible <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0484"/>to the
                                    President. This argument has no basis in fact. The President
                                    already has all the discretion he needs under the Lend Lease
                                    Act. If after the war in Europe comes to an end, the President
                                    feels that France is making a contribution to the war in the
                                    Pacific or should for other reasons be entitled to
                                    reconstruction under Lend Lease, he can enter into a new
                                    agreement at that time. The only additional “discretion” gained
                                    by signing the agreement, as recommended by State and <gloss

                                    in Europe is over. If the Congress should cut off Lend Lease

                                    on large requisitions placed under a previously existing
                                    agreement with the French (having no relation to the war in
                                    Europe) as permitting the reconstruction of France would be
                                    politically impossible and highly undesirable.</item>

                                            has agreed to a reconstruction program for France. This
                                            is particularly true in the light of informal
                                            commitments which have been made to the French by
                                            various people in <gloss target="#t_FEA1">FEA</gloss>
                                            and State to this effect. It follows that this will be
                                            construed by the French as being a major political
                                            victory arising from their strategy of playing one
                                            department of the United States Government against
                                            another on financial questions.</item>

                                        <item>Although the program being presented to the President
                                            provides for approval by the White House of the
                                            implementation of this agreement, it is obvious that the
                                            White House is not and should not be placed in a
                                            position to police detailed supply programs. The door
                                            will be wide open for reconstructing France under the
                                            Lend Lease Act without understandings as to the role of
                                            France in the future of Europe and of the world, and
                                            particularly of French participation in the war against
                                            Japan.</item>

                                    proposal to give discretion to the President, its practical
                                    effect will be to tie his hands with respect to our dealings
                                    with the French at the termination of the war in Europe much
                                    more than would otherwise be the case.</item>

                            <p>I also hope that these important discussions may end successfully.
                                This may be of serious significance for the further strengthening of
                                cooperation of our countries and for the whole cause of future peace
                                and security.</p>
                            <p>I must say that for the success of the activities of the
                                International Security Organization, of great significance will be
                                the order of voting in the Council, having in mind the importance
                                that the Council work on the basis of the principle of coordination
                                and unanimity of the four leading powers on all questions, including
                                those which directly relate to one of these nations. The initial
                                American proposal that there should be established a special
                                procedure of voting in case of a dispute in which one or several
                                members of the Council, who have the statute [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >status?</hi>] of permanent members, are directly involved,
                                seems to me correct. Otherwise will be brought to naught the
                                agreement achieved among us at the Teheran Conference which is

                                course, that among these powers there is no room for mutual
                                suspicions. As to the Soviet Union, it cannot also ignore the
                                presence of certain absurd prejudices which <hi rend="italic"
                                    >often</hi> hinder an actually objective attitude toward the

                                nations also should weigh the consequences which the lack of
                                unanimity among the leading powers may bring about.</p>
                            <p>I hope that you will understand the seriousness of the considerations

                                    council. He said that his Government maintained its insistence
                                    upon the inviolability of the principle of the unanimity of the
                                    four great powers. He said that he had made a number of other
                                    concessions but that there was no possibility of his being
                                    authorized to give in on this point.</item>

                            <p>Memorandum from the President for the Under Secretary of State.</p>
                            <p>Neither the Prime Minister nor I are inclined to approve the proposed
                                    amendment.<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">Quoted in Stettinius’
                                    telegram of September 15, 1944, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >supra</hi>.</note></p>
                            <p>My thought has been that this amendment or a general reference to the
                                subject should be mentioned in the agreement as having been
                                discussed but without reaching any agreement or decision, thus
                                leaving it up to the meeting of the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Churchill, on the other hand, is afraid that this procedure will
                                be unacceptable to the Russians, as they would know that they would
                                be overwhelmingly defeated in a United Nations’ meeting and that
                                they would get sore and try to take it out on all of us on some
                                other point.</p>
                            <p>That is about the only information I can give you. Cadogan will
                                return Monday, I think, and he can give you any further news.<note
                                    n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">When Cadogan returned from Quebec to
                                    Washington, he stated that he had been instructed to inform
                                    Stettinius and Gromyko officially that the British Government
                                    could not endorse the compromise voting formula which Stettinius
                                    had sent to Roosevelt at Quebec. See <ref
                                        target="frus1944v01#pg_815"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                        p. 815</ref>, fn. 96. Stettinius later learned from Gromyko
                                    that he had also received official instructions that the formula
                                    was unacceptable. See <ref target="frus1944v01#pg_816"><hi

                            <p>I think we should keep on trying but if we cannot agree on this or
                                any other point, I am inclined to favor either not mentioning
                                disagreement or putting disagreements under a general statement that
                                certain points have not been agreed on. I am still greatly in favor
                                of a reference to the United Nations for discussion as soon as
                                possible.</p>

                            <p>Part or all of the Fifth Army should be transferred to France, if it
                                can be used effectively in the attack on Germany. The timing of the
                                transfer and the route, whether overland or by sea, is dependent on
                                the progress and outcome of the present offensive in Italy.</p>
                            <p>If General Eisenhower indicates that he does not require a part or
                                all of the U.S. forces now in Italy, they should then be utilized to
                                clear the Germans from Italy and to assist British forces in
                                operations to the northeastward toward Vienna.</p>
                            <p>The transfer of part or all of the Twelfth Air Force to France should
                                be dependent on the progress and outcome of the present offensive in
                                Italy, and more particularly on the disposition of the Fifth Army.
                                The Fifteenth Air Force can best perform its mission by remaining at
                                its Foggia bases.</p>

                            <p>9. The Supreme Commander’s broad intention is to press on with all
                                speed to destroy the German armed forces and occupy the heart of
                                Germany. He considers his best opportunity of defeating the enemy in
                                the west lies in striking at the Ruhr and Saar since he is convinced
                                that the enemy will concentrate the remainder of his available
                                forces in the defense of these essential areas. The Supreme
                                Commander’s first operation will be one to break the Siegfried Line
                                and seize crossings over the Rhine. In doing this his main effort
                                will be on the left. He will then prepare logistically and otherwise
                                for a deep thrust into Germany.</p>

                                <p>1. Operations in the North Pacific have been limited to periodic
                                    air raids and surface ship bombardment of Paramushiru and
                                    Shimushu and other islands in the northern Kuriles. Concurrently
                                    the establishment of bases to support future operations in the
                                    North Pacific is being carried to completion.</p>
                                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Central Pacific</hi></p>
                                <p>2. In furtherance of the approved strategic concept of the war
                                    against Japan, the amphibious forces of the Pacific Ocean Areas,
                                    supported tactically and strategically by combatant units of the
                                    U.S. Pacific Fleet, have successively occupied principal
                                    objectives in the Gilbert, Marshall and Marianas Islands.</p>
                                <p>3. The Gilbert Islands operations were initiated on 17 November
                                    1943, and resulted in the occupation of Tarawa, Makin, and
                                    Apamama. Tarawa was well defended. In particular the beach
                                    defenses were extensive and difficult to overcome.</p>
                                <p>4. The Marshall Islands operations were initiated the 31st of
                                    January and resulted in the occupation of Kwajalein and Majuro
                                    Atolls. This was followed by the occupation in mid-February of
                                    Eniwetok.</p>
                                <p>5. Operations for the seizure of Saipan were initiated on the
                                    15th of June. This was followed by the occupation of Tinian and
                                    Guam in late July.</p>
                                <p>6. The next operation scheduled in this area is the occupation of
                                    the Palaus. The target date is 15 September 1944.</p>
                                <p>7. From bases established in the Marshalls and Gilberts
                                    continuous air raids have been conducted against isolated
                                    Japanese held islands. Particular attention has been given to
                                    neutralization of Truk. These operations have been coordinated
                                    with similar operations conducted from bases in the Southwest
                                    Pacific.</p>
                                <p>8. During the operations for the occupation of the Marianas
                                    strong units of the Japanese Fleet were engaged by air action
                                    from our carriers in the Philippine Seas. Severe damage was
                                    inflicted on the Japanese in this engagement.</p>
                                <p>9. The submarine campaign in the Western Pacific has been
                                    prosecuted with vigor and the results attained have been most
                                    gratifying. Heavy toll has been taken of Japanese shipping as
                                    well as of escorting forces.</p>
                                <p>10. The occupation of the Marianas has presented the opportunity
                                    for development of bases for <gloss target="#t_VLR1">VLR</gloss>

                                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">South Pacific</hi></p>
                                <p>11. Operations in the South Pacific have been principally
                                    harassing operations against the isolated Japanese garrisons by
                                    air forces. The Royal New Zealand Air Force participated in
                                    combat missions with U.S. Army and Navy air units from bases in
                                    the South Pacific. The South Pacific area is being progressively
                                    “rolled-up.” Bases developed in that area are currently being
                                    used for rehabilitation of troops for further operations in the
                                    Western Pacific. The naval base at Espiritu Santo has proved
                                    very useful in repairing battle damage. Repairs have been
                                    successfully accomplished on all classes of ships.</p>
                                <p>12. On 15 February, the 3rd New Zealand Division (less one
                                    brigade) seized Green Island.</p>
                                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Southwest Pacific</hi></p>
                                <p>13. A U.S. task force landed in the Arawe area of New Britain on
                                    15 December 1943 and terminated organized enemy resistance on 16
                                    January 1944.</p>
                                <p>14. One U.S. marine division, supported by Allied air and naval
                                    forces, landed in the Gloucester area on 26 December 1943 and
                                    succeeded in capturing the airfields by 30 December. Japanese
                                    killed were 3,686 as against our losses of 326. As a result of
                                    the Arawe and Cape Gloucester operations, western New Britain
                                    was secured by the middle of March.</p>
                                <p>15. Preceded by heavy naval and air bombardment, a successful,
                                    unopposed landing was made near Saidor on 2 January 1944. The
                                    airstrip was captured and ready for landing of transport
                                    aircraft by 7 January. Commencing 16 January, the remainder of
                                    the U.S. division employed reinforced the original landing. In
                                    expanding the beachhead, only weak resistance was
                                    encountered.</p>
                                <p>16. One U.S. cavalry division, supported by naval and air force
                                    units, made initial landings in the Admiralty Islands on 29
                                    February 1944. The landing was made in Hayne Harbor, Los Negros
                                    Island, against little resistance and Momote airdrome was seized
                                    on <gloss target="#t_DDay1">D-day</gloss>. Several enemy
                                    counterattacks were repulsed resulting in large Japanese
                                    casualties and by 23 March enemy forces on Los Negros were
                                    completely surrounded. Adjacent islands in the group were
                                    reduced and occupied and by the middle of April complete control
                                    of the Admiralty Islands had been obtained.</p>
                                <p>17. Two independent task forces, under the command of the Sixth
                                    Army, made simultaneous landings at Aitape and Hollandia on 22

                                    Landings were preceded by heavy naval bombardment and air
                                    strafing attacks.</p>

                                        movement in attacking the three airstrips. Only slight enemy
                                        resistance was encountered and by 1 May control of the area
                                        had been definitely established.</item>

                                    <item>The element of surprise played an important part in the
                                        success of both operations resulting in an estimated 54,000
                                        troops to the eastward being cut off.</item>

                                <p>18. A U.S. task force, supported by air and naval forces, made
                                    unopposed landings on Wakde Island and near Arara on 17 May
                                    1944. All enemy resistance on Wakde was overcome by 18 May. The
                                    Arara perimeter was extended between the Tementoe River and the
                                    Tor River on 17 May with increasing enemy resistance west of the
                                    Tor River. Strong enemy attacks failed to penetrate the
                                    perimeter and were repulsed. The task force perimeter was
                                    extended and by 3 July included the Maffin airdrome. Casualties
                                    suffered by the Japanese are 3,650 killed and 70 prisoners.
                                    Active patrolling is continuing.</p>
                                <p>19. On 27 May 1944 one U.S. infantry division, with the support
                                    of air and naval forces, made landings in the Biak Island areas
                                    and encountered little opposition initially. Enemy strength
                                    developed on 5 June and the Mokmer airstrip was crossed on 7
                                    June under artillery, mortar and machine gun fire. Artillery
                                    fire prevented work on the Mokmer airdrome until 11 June and the
                                    enemy launched several unsuccessful counterattacks in an effort
                                    to regain the field. Boroke, Sorido and Mokmer dromes were
                                    entirely cleared of enemy artillery and small arms fire by 22
                                    June. General patrolling and mopping up operations continue.</p>
                                <p>20. One U.S. regimental combat team, closely supported by air and
                                    naval forces, landed unopposed near the Kamiri drome on Noemfoor
                                    Island on 2 July 1944. On 3 July and 4 July three U.S. parachute
                                    battalions were dropped on the Kamiri strip, assisting the
                                    infantry. By 6 July enemy resistance had been overcome and the
                                    Kamiri, Koransoren and Namber dromes were firmly held.</p>
                                <p>21. A U.S. infantry task force made an unopposed landing near
                                    Cape Opmarai in the Cape Sansapor area on 30 July 1944. No
                                    opposition other than patrol skirmishes has been encountered and
                                    active patrolling continues. Japanese dead for the period 30
                                    July to 10 August numbered 92.</p>
                                <p>22. Air operations conducted in the Southwest Pacific Area have
                                    been especially effective in neutralizing Japanese forces and
                                    enabling <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0508"/>the Allies to
                                    conduct further offensive actions aimed at gaining complete
                                    control. In all advances, their mission in each case called for
                                    securing airfields and other bases from which to conduct further
                                    operations. Air supremacy has been achieved to such an extent
                                    that only in isolated instances are the Japanese offering any
                                    determined air resistance.</p>
                                <p>23. Australian land force activity in the Southwest Pacific Area
                                    consisted primarily of participation in the Finschhafen and
                                    Kaiapit-Dumpu operations and the occupation of the Madang-Sepik
                                    River coast line. The 9th Australian Division captured
                                    Finschhafen on 2 October 1943 and drove the remaining Jap troops
                                    to Satelberg. Satelberg fell on 29 November. Elements of the 9th
                                    Australian Division, utilizing armor to great advantage, then
                                    advanced up Huon Peninsula coast line to contact U.S. Saidor
                                    Task Force at Yaut River, southeast of Saidor, to complete
                                    occupation of Huon Peninsula on 10 February.</p>
                                <p>Simultaneously, the 7th Australian Division was deployed into the
                                    Ramu Valley to reinforce independent Australian units and to
                                    stop the threatened Jap drive overland through the Ramu-Markham
                                    Valley from Madang. The 11th Australian Division relieved the
                                    7th Australian Division 8 January and continued the Australian
                                    advance to a final juncture with U.S. troops near Yalua on 13
                                    April. Subsequently, U.S. troops were withdrawn and the
                                    Australian units continued pressure on the Jap forces which
                                    withdrew up the New Guinea coast toward Wewak. By 6 June
                                    Australian troops had reached Hansa Bay and are now in contact
                                    along the Sepik River.</p>
                                <p>During this period, the <gloss target="#t_RAAF1">RAAF</gloss>
                                    carried on continued attacks from the Darwin area. Australian
                                    fighter units attached to U.S. task forces were used in each of
                                    the landings along the New Guinea coast as the initial
                                    occupation forces with their light <gloss target="#t_P401"

                                <p>They operated in the advance airdromes before the airdromes were
                                    suitable for the operation of U.S. units equipped with heavier

                                    Pacific Area consist of the 18th Medium Bomber Squadron and the
                                    120th Fighter Squadron. Elements of these forces participated in
                                    daily bombing and strafing strikes against enemy shipping and
                                    installations in the Aroe-Tanimbar-Kai and Timor areas.</p>

                                    arms and munitions but will not compel them to surrender or to
                                    withdraw supposing this to be possible. Area as a whole has
                                    sufficient food and other materials and facilities for
                                    maintenance and it may be assumed that Japanese forces have
                                    sufficient stocks of arms and munitions. Experience points to
                                    probability that Japanese stay on for irregular warfare even
                                    after defeat or surrender Japan. Facts in recovered territory in
                                    the area show that isolated Japanese forces become more
                                    ferocious and destructive as isolation becomes more
                                    irremediable. If liberation occupied areas is delayed suffering
                                    and destruction of large populations will increase beyond all
                                    measure and prisoners of war and internees can be considered
                                    lost. Since voluntary evacuation of the area by Japanese forces
                                    cannot be expected active liberation as soon as possible seems
                                    urgent both from this point of view and with regard to future
                                    rehabilitation. This action should primarily be directed towards
                                    most important territories with most civilized and numerous
                                    population and greatest economic value. Among these Java seems
                                    to offer best base for further operations because of central
                                    situation, sufficient food production and accommodation, ample
                                    skilled and unskilled labour, well developed system of roads and
                                    harbours, good airbases and healthy mountain regions for
                                    rehabilitation. Even in case of widespread destruction repairs
                                    for Allied operational purposes are easiest to effect in Java.
                                    The occupation of Java would deprive the Japanese of their main
                                    regional source of supplies and labour.’”</p>

                            <p>To force the unconditional surrender of Japan by: <list>

                                    Area</hi></p>
                            <p>22. We believe that operations must be devised to accomplish the
                                defeat of Japan at the earliest possible date and to that end our
                                plans should retain flexibility, and provision should be made to
                                take full advantage of possible developments in the strategic
                                situation which may permit taking all manner of short cuts. We
                                propose to exploit to the fullest the Allied superiority of naval
                                and air power and to avoid, wherever possible, commitment to costly
                                land campaigns. Unremitting submarine warfare against the enemy
                                ships will be continued. Very long range bomber operations against
                                Japan proper will be continued from China bases and will be
                                instituted from bases being established in the Marianas and from
                                those to be seized in the future. The air forces in China will
                                continue to support operations of the Chinese ground forces and will
                                also provide the maximum practical support for the campaign in the
                                Pacific.</p>

                                allocation of resources. In planning production these requirements
                                will be borne in mind.</p>

                                that this Fleet will be balanced and self-supporting. The method of

                            <p>29. We consider that the whole problem of the redeployment of forces
                                after the end of the war in Europe, including repatriation, needs
                                combined study in order to assure the optimum use of the resources
                                involved, including personnel and cargo shipping, and to make
                                certain that the forces required for operations against Japan will
                                reach the theatre of war at the earliest date. We have accordingly
                                instructed the combined staffs in consultation with the combined
                                shipping authorities to study and report on this problem, submitting
                                to the Combined Chiefs of Staff such questions as may require
                                decision before completion of the study.</p>

                            <p>30. We feel that it is important to agree and promulgate a planning
                                date for the end of the war against Japan. This date is necessary
                                for the purpose of planning production and the allocation of
                                manpower.</p>
                            <p>31. We recommend that the planning date for the end of the war
                                against Japan should be set at 18 months after the defeat of
                                Germany; this date to be adjusted periodically to conform to the
                                course of the war.</p>

                                <p>The Combined Chiefs of Staff desire to place on record that the
                                    main difficulty with which the Quebec Conference has been
                                    confronted has been to find room and opportunity for the
                                    deployment against Japan of the massive forces which each and
                                    all of the nations concerned are ardent to engage against the
                                    enemy. In colloquial language, it was a case of “standing room
                                    only”, even before the curtain rang up on the Conference.</p>
                                <p>2. The Combined Chiefs of Staff have not included any
                                    recommendation on this subject in their Final Report, but they
                                    submit that it would have an excellent effect on world opinion
                                    in general, and a correspondingly depressing effect on Japan, if
                                    the above ideas, clothed in your own language, were included in
                                    a communiqué about the Conference (if one is issued), and, also,
                                    at the Press Conference which will be held on its
                                    conclusion.</p>

                                        hasten to inform you of plans for our mutual effort,
                                        particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>

                                        <item>First: We are determined fully to employ all available
                                            resources toward the earliest practicable invasion of
                                            the Japanese homeland. To <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461"
                                                facs="0523"/>this end we have devised courses of
                                            action and are taking vigorous steps to expedite the
                                            redeployment of forces to the war against Japan
                                            following the defeat of Germany.</item>
                                        <item>Second: To continue and extend present operations
                                            under Admiral Mountbatten in North Burma to provide
                                            additional security for intermediate air ferry bases in
                                            the Myitkyina area, and at the beginning of favorable
                                            weather to launch a determined campaign to open overland
                                            communications between India and China. These operations
                                            will require continued effective cooperation of the
                                            Chinese troops who have already so distinguished
                                            themselves in Burma, as well as of your armies that are
                                            now engaged west of the Salween. The detailed operations
                                            will involve overland and airborne advances by the
                                            British from Imphal to seize Kalewa, thence the
                                            Yeu-Monywa area with exploitation toward Mandalay. At
                                            the same time, the Chinese, British and American forces
                                            now in the Myitkyina area will push on to
                                            Indaw-Katha-Bhamo, thence toward Mongmit-Mogok.
                                            Concurrently, your Chinese armies now engaged west of
                                            the Salween should drive vigorously toward Hsenwi and
                                            Lashio. All these operations will be fully supported by
                                            our preponderant air strength, and by adequate air
                                            supply. Small-scale amphibious operations on the Arakan
                                            coast, and activities by long range penetration groups
                                            will contribute to our success. We feel that the
                                            vigorous prosecution of these operations should result
                                            in securing an area by next spring which will permit the
                                            extension of the Ledo Eoad with accompanying pipelines
                                            in order to support the heroic effort of your
                                            forces.</item>
                                        <item>Third: Without prejudice to the North Burma operations
                                            to protect the air ferry line and establish overland
                                            communications, Admiral Mountbatten has been further
                                            directed to continue planning and preparations for a
                                            large scale amphibious and airborne operation in South
                                            Burma to be undertaken as soon as developments in the
                                            European Theater will allow the necessary resources to
                                            be made available.</item>

                                        <item>We have agreed that in the west our object should be
                                            the recapture of Burma at the earliest date. We attach
                                            the greatest importance to the vigorous prosecution of
                                            operations in Upper Burma in order to secure the air

                                            Myitkyina, and to open overland communications with you.
                                            It is therefore intended to pursue with the utmost vigor
                                            the present operations in Upper Burma. Reinforcements,

                                            The date when it can be carried out will depend on the

                                attack across the Salween or suggestion of withdrawal is exactly
                                what the Jap has been striving to cause you to do by his operations
                                in Eastern China. He knows that if you continue to attack,
                                cooperating with Mountbatten’s coming offensive, the land line to
                                China will be opened in early 1945 and the continued resistance of
                                China and maintenance of your control will be assured. On the other
                                hand, if you do not provide manpower for your Divisions in North
                                Burma and, if you fail to send reinforcements to the Salween forces
                                and withdraw these armies, we will lose all chance of opening land
                                communications with China and immediately jeopardize the air route
                                over the hump. For this you must yourself be prepared to accept the
                                consequences and assume the personal responsibility.</p>
                            <p>I have urged time and again in recent months that you take drastic
                                action to resist the disaster which has been moving closer to China
                                and to you. Now, when you have not yet placed General Stilwell in
                                command of all forces in China, we are faced with the loss of a
                                critical area in East China with possible catastrophic consequences.
                                The Japanese capture of Kweilin will place the Kunming air terminal
                                under the menace of constant air attack, reducing the hump tonnage
                                and possibly severing the air route.</p>
                            <p>Even though we are rolling the enemy back in defeat all over the
                                world this will not help the situation in China for a considerable
                                time. The advance of our forces across the Pacific is swift. But
                                this advance will be too late for China unless you act now and
                                vigorously. Only drastic and immediate action on your part alone can
                                be in time to preserve the fruits of your long years of struggle and
                                the efforts we have been able to make to support you. Otherwise
                                political and military considerations alike are going to be
                                swallowed in military disaster.</p>
                            <p>The Prime Minister and I have just decided at Quebec to press
                                vigorously the operations to open the land line to China on the
                                assumption that you would continue an unremitting attack from the
                                Salween side. I am certain that the only thing you can now do in an
                                attempt to prevent the Jap from achieving his objectives in China is
                                to reinforce jour Salween armies immediately and press their
                                offensive, while at once placing General Stilwell in unrestricted
                                command of all your <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0528"/>forces.
                                The action I am asking you to take will fortify us in our decision
                                and in the continued efforts the United States proposes to take to
                                maintain and increase our aid to you. This we are doing when we are
                                fighting two other great campaigns in Europe and across the Pacific.
                                I trust that your far-sighted vision, which has guided and inspired
                                your people in this war, will realize the necessity for immediate
                                action. In this message I have expressed my thoughts with complete
                                frankness because it appears plainly evident to all of us here that
                                all your and our efforts to save China are to be lost by further
                                delays.</p>

                                <p>At a conference between the President and the Prime Minister upon
                                    the best measures to prevent renewed rearmament by Germany, it
                                    was felt that an essential feature was the future disposition of
                                    the Ruhr and the Saar.</p>

                                <p>The ease with which the metallurgical, chemical and electric
                                    industries in Germany can be converted from peace to war has
                                    already been impressed upon us by bitter experience. It must
                                    also be remembered that the Germans have devastated a large
                                    portion of the industries of Russia and of other neighbouring
                                    Allies, and it is only in accordance with justice that these
                                    injured countries should, be entitled to remove the machinery
                                    they require in order to repair the losses they have suffered.
                                    The industries referred to in the Ruhr and in the Saar would
                                    therefore be necessarily put out of action and closed down. It
                                    was felt that the two districts should be put under some body
                                    under the world organization which<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2"

                                    industries and make sure that they were not started up again by

                                <p>This programme for eliminating the war-making industries in the
                                    Ruhr and in the Saar is looking forward to converting Germany
                                    into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its
                                    character.</p>
                                <p>The Prime Minister and the President were in agreement upon this

                                <p>20. In our instructions we have stressed that to eliminate the

                                    United States and British Military Missions, it is essential
                                    that the Russian representative on the Committee should be a
                                    senior member of the Russian General Staff. On the United States
                                    and British sides the heads of the present missions would
                                    represent the United States and British Chiefs of Staff
                                    respectively, each being responsible to his own Chiefs of

                                <p>22. We believe that operations must be devised to accomplish the
                                    defeat of Japan at the earliest possible date and to that end
                                    our plans should retain flexibility, and provision should be
                                    made to take full advantage of possible developments in the
                                    strategic situation which may permit taking all manner of short
                                    cuts. We propose to exploit to the fullest the Allied
                                    superiority of naval and air power and to avoid, wherever
                                    possible, commitment to costly land campaigns. Unremitting
                                    submarine warfare against the enemy ships will be continued.
                                    Very long range bomber operations against Japan Proper will be
                                    continued from China bases and will be instituted from bases
                                    being established in the Marianas and from those to be seized in
                                    the future. The air forces in China will continue to support
                                    operations of the Chinese ground forces and will also provide
                                    the maximum practical support for the campaign in the
                                    Pacific.</p>
                                <p>23. Pursuant to the above, the operations in the Pacific Theater
                                    are being conducted to effect the reconquest of the Philippines
                                    and the opening of a seaway to China.</p>
                                <p>24. We have noted that British operations against Japan, not yet
                                    approved, will require the allocation of resources. In planning
                                    production these requirements will be borne in mind.</p>

                                <p>25. We have agreed that the British Fleet should participate in

                                    understanding that this Fleet will be balanced and
                                    self-supporting. The method of the employment of the British
                                    Fleet in these main operations in the Pacific will be decided
                                    from time to time in accordance with the prevailing

                                <p>30. We consider that the whole problem of the redeployment of
                                    forces after the end of the war in Europe, including
                                    repatriation, needs combined study in order to assure the
                                    optimum use of the resources involved, including personnel and
                                    cargo shipping, and to make certain that the forces required for

                                <p>1. In our Conference at Quebec just concluded we have arrived at
                                    the following decisions as to military operations.</p>
                                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Operations in North West
                                        Europe</hi></p>
                                <p>2. It is our intention to press on with all speed to destroy the
                                    German armed forces and penetrate into the heart of Germany. The
                                    best opportunity to defeat the enemy in the west lies in
                                    striking at the Kuhr and Saar since it is there that the enemy
                                    will concentrate the remainder of his available forces in the
                                    defence of these essential areas. The northern line of approach
                                    clearly has advantages over the southern and it is essential
                                    that we should open up the northwest ports, particularly Antwerp
                                    and Rotterdam, before bad weather sets in. Our main effort will
                                    therefore be on the left.</p>

                                <p>Number 68, from Admiral Leahy, Chief of Staff to the President.
                                    Top secret and personal to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek from
                                    President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill.</p>
                                <p>We have just concluded our conference in Quebec during which we
                                    discussed ways and means to bring about the earliest possible
                                    defeat of Germany so that we can reorient the entire weight of
                                    our forces and resources against Japan. We hasten to inform you
                                    of plans for our mutual effort, particularly in Southeast
                                    Asia.</p>
                                <list>
                                    <item>First: We are determined fully to employ all available
                                        resources toward the earliest practicable invasion of the
                                        Japanese homeland. To this end we have devised courses of
                                        action and are taking vigorous steps to expedite the
                                        redeployment of forces to the war against Japan following
                                        the defeat of Germany.</item>
                                    <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0544"/>
                                    <item>Second: To continue and extend present operations under
                                        Admiral Mountbatten in north Burma to provide additional
                                        security for intermediate air ferry bases in the Myitkyina
                                        area, and at the beginning of favorable weather to launch a
                                        determined campaign to open overland communications between
                                        India and China. These operations will require continued
                                        effective cooperation of the Chinese troops who have already
                                        so distinguished themselves in Burma, as well as of your
                                        armies that are now engaged west of the Salween. All these
                                        operations will be fully supported by our preponderant air
                                        strength, and by adequate air supply. Small-scale amphibious
                                        operations on the Arakan coast, and activities by long range
                                        penetration groups will contribute to our success. We feel
                                        that the vigorous prosecution of these operations should
                                        result in securing an area by next spring which will permit
                                        the extension of the Ledo Road with accompanying pipelines
                                        in order to support the heroic effort of your forces.</item>
                                    <item>Third: Admiral Mountbatten has been further directed to
                                        prepare a large scale amphibious operation in the Bay of
                                        Bengal to be undertaken as soon as developments in the
                                        European Theater will allow the necessary resources to be
                                        made available.</item>
                                    <item>Fourth: We have agreed on further operations to intensify
                                        the offensive against the Japanese in the Pacific Theater,
                                        including the opening of a seaway into China.</item>

                        <p>Roosevelt arrived at Hyde Park, following the Second Quebec Conference,
                            about 9:30 a.m. on September 17, 1944, accompanied by Leahy, Lieutenant
                            Commander Bruenn, Miss Tully, and Mrs. Brady (see the Log, <hi
                                rend="italic">ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_294">p. 294</ref>). Mrs.
                            Roosevelt was already at Hyde Park, having left Quebec on September 14
                            (see the Log, <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_291">p.
                                291</ref>). Hassett flew from Washington to meet Roosevelt at Hyde
                            Park on September 17 (see Hassett, p. 271), and Hopkins arrived at noon
                            on September 18 (see Leahy, p. 263).</p>
                        <p>Churchill traveled to Hyde Park from Quebec a day after the President,
                            arriving there at 11 a.m. on September 18, accompanied by Mrs.
                            Churchill, the Churchills’ daughter Mary, Leathers, Ismay, Moran,
                            Martin, and Thompson (see Hassett, p. 271, Churchill, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Triumph and Tragedy</hi>, p. 160, and Pawle, pp. 323-324). The
                            Churchill party left Hyde Park at 10:30 p.m., September 19, traveling by
                            train to New York, where they boarded the <hi rend="italic">Queen
                                Mary</hi> for the trip back to England (see Leahy, p. 266).</p>
                        <p>Other guests who were present during Churchill’s visit included the Duke
                            of Windsor, who came to luncheon on September 18 (see Leahy, pp.
                            263-264); Morgenthau and Mr. and Mrs. Lytle Hull, who came to dinner on
                            that date (see Morgenthau Diary, vol. 772, and Leahy Diary); three
                            Roosevelt cousins—Mrs. Dowd, Miss Delano, and Miss Suckley—who were at
                            luncheon with Mrs. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Leahy on September 19 (see
                            Leahy Diary); and the President’s son-in-law, Major John Boettiger (see
                            Leahy, p. 264). Except for Morgenthau and Boettiger (see below), no
                            indication has been found that any of these guests participated in the
                            substantive work of the Roosevelt-Churchill meetings at Hyde Park.</p>
                        <p>Since Churchill was a guest in the Roosevelts’ home, there took place a
                            number of informal and unscheduled conversations between him and
                            Roosevelt, and the President (as was his custom) prepared no minutes or
                            memoranda of conversation on them. The documents which follow constitute
                            the only official papers which the editors have found which were
                            prepared for or relate to the Hyde Park discussions.</p>
                        <p>Leahy, pp. 264-265, makes brief mention of (1) a discussion of “political
                            questions involving Italy, Yugoslavia, and Russia” before <pb n="482"
                                xml:id="pg_482" facs="0546"/>dinner on September 18; (2) signature

                            the drafting of a statement on Italy in which Leahy, Hopkins, and
                            Boettiger took part—possibly the draft printed <hi rend="italic"
                                >post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_493">p. 493</ref>; (4) a luncheon on
                            September 19 at which Mrs. Roosevelt and Churchill discussed means of
                            preserving international peace; and (5) a Roosevelt–Churchill discussion
                            of military and industrial uses of atomic energy, which led to the
                            initialing of an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> on this subject
                            (see <hi rend="italic">post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_492">p.
                            492</ref>).</p>
                        <p>Morgenthau reported to a group of colleagues at the Treasury Department
                            on September 19 that he had learned at dinner the preceding night at
                            Hyde Park—apparently from Churchill or Martin—that the British
                            Government would name the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir John
                            Anderson) to serve on the committee on lend-lease problems which had
                            been agreed to at Quebec, but that he would probably be represented on
                            the committee by Lord Keynes. Morgenthau further reported that he had
                            said that this would be quite acceptable. (Morgenthau Diary, vol.
                            772)</p>
                        <p>It appears from Woodward, pp. 295-296, that Churchill intended to speak
                            to Roosevelt at Hyde Park about armistice terms for Bulgaria and spheres
                            of influence in the Balkans, but no evidence has been found to show that
                            Churchill did in fact raise these questions with the President.</p>
                        <p>Churchill’s Hyde Park visit is mentioned also in Churchill, <hi
                                rend="italic">Triumph and Tragedy</hi>, pp. 160-161, in Hassett, pp.
                            271-272, and in Pawle, p. 324, but these sources add no information on
                            the substance of the Roosevelt-Churchill conversations.</p>

                            wish to reiterate briefly that I still feel that the course proposed by
                            the Treasury would in the long run certainly defeat what we hope to
                            attain by a complete military victory,—this is, the peace of the world,
                            and the assurance of social, economic and political stability in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>The point of difference is not one of objective,—continued world peace—it
                            is one of means. When we discuss means, the difference is not whether we
                            should be soft or tough on the German people, but rather whether the
                            course proposed will in fact best attain our agreed objective, continued
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>If I thought that the Treasury proposals would accomplish that objective,
                            I would not persist in my objections. But I cannot believe that they
                            will make for a lasting peace. In spirit and in emphasis they are
                            punitive, not, in my judgment, corrective or constructive. They will
                            tend through bitterness and suffering to breed another war, not to make
                            another war undesired by the Germans nor impossible in fact. It is not
                            within the realm of possibility that a whole nation of seventy million
                            people, who have been outstanding for many years in the arts and the
                            sciences and who through their efficiency and energy have attained one
                            of the highest industrial levels in Europe, can by force be required to
                            abandon all their previous methods of life, be reduced to a peasant
                            level with virtually complete control of industry and science left to
                            other peoples.</p>
                        <p>The question is not whether we want Germans to suffer for their sins.
                            Many of us would like to see them suffer the tortures they have
                            inflicted on others. The only question is whether over the years a group
                            of seventy million educated, efficient and imaginative people can be
                            kept within bounds on such a low level of subsistence as the Treasury
                            proposals contemplate. I do not believe that is humanly possible. A
                            subordinate question is whether even if you could do this it is good for
                            the rest of the world either economically or spiritually. Sound thinking
                            teaches that prosperity in one part of the world helps to create
                            prosperity in other parts of the world. It also teaches that poverty in
                            one part of the world usually induces poverty in other parts. Enforced
                            poverty is even worse, for it destroys the spirit not only of the victim
                            but debases the <gloss target="#t_Victor1">victor</gloss>. It would be
                            just such a crime as the Germans themselves hoped to perpetrate upon
                            their victims—it would be a crime against civilization itself.</p>
                        <p>This country since its very beginning has maintained the fundamental
                            belief that all men, in the long run, have the right to be free human
                            beings and to live in the pursuit of happiness. Under the <pb n="484"
                                xml:id="pg_484" facs="0548"/>Atlantic Charter victors and vanquished
                            alike are entitled to freedom from economic want. But the proposed
                            treatment of Germany would, if successful, deliberately deprive many
                            millions of people of the right to freedom from want and freedom from
                            fear. Other peoples all over the world would suspect the validity of our
                            spiritual tenets and question the long range effectiveness of our
                            economic and political principles as applied to the vanquished.</p>
                        <p>The proposals would mean a forcible revolution in all of the basic
                            methods of life of a vast section of the population as well as a
                            disruption of many accustomed geographical associations and
                            communications. Such an operation would naturally and necessarily
                            involve a chaotic upheaval in the people’s lives which would inevitably
                            be productive of the deepest resentment and bitterness towards the
                            authorities which had imposed such revolutionary changes upon them.
                            Physically, considering the fact that their present enlarged population
                            has been developed and supported under an entirely different geography
                            and economy, it would doubtless cause tremendous suffering involving
                            virtual starvation and death for many, and migrations and changes for
                            others. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for them to
                            understand any purpose or cause for such revolutionary changes other
                            than mere vengeance of their enemies and this alone would strongly tend
                            towards the most bitter reactions.</p>
                        <p>I am prepared to accede to the argument that even if German resources
                            were wiped off the map, the European economy would somehow readjust
                            itself, perhaps with the help of Great Britain and this country. And the
                            world would go on. The benefit to England by the suppression of German
                            competition is greatly stressed in the Treasury memorandum. But this is
                            an argument addressed to a shortsighted cupidity of the victors and the
                            negation of all that Secretary Hull has been trying to accomplish since
                            1933. I am aware of England’s need, but I do not and cannot believe that
                            she wishes this kind of remedy. I feel certain that in her own interest
                            she could not afford to follow this path. The total elimination of a
                            competitor (who is always also a potential purchaser) is rarely a
                            satisfactory solution of a commercial problem.</p>
                        <p>The sum total of the drastic political and economic steps proposed by the
                            Treasury is an open confession of the bankruptcy of hope for a
                            reasonable economic and political settlement of the causes of war.</p>
                        <p>I plead for no “soft” treatment of Germany. I urge only that we take
                            steps which in the light of history are reasonably adapted to our
                            purpose, namely, the prevention of future wars. The Carthaginian aspect
                            of the proposed plan would, in my judgment, provoke a reaction on the
                            part of the people in this country and in the rest of the world which
                            would operate not only against the measures advocated but in its <pb
                                n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0549"/>violence would sweep away the
                            proper and reasonable restrictive measures that we could justifiably
                            impose.</p>

                            knowledge of conditions and trends within Germany as well as of the
                            views and intentions of our Allies.</p>

                            current problems with Italy, we would like to submit the following
                            considerations to the President during his conversations with the
                            British Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Certain areas of Italy’s northeastern frontier will probably be in
                            dispute after hostilities. In order that the final disposition of these
                            disputed areas would not be prejudiced by occupation by the armed forces
                            of claimant states, it is suggested that Allied Military Government be
                            extended to all Italian metropolitan territory within its 1939
                            frontiers. In the South Tyrol and the Istrian Peninsula (Venezia
                            Tridentina and Venezia Giulia), Allied Military Government should be
                            maintained and these areas not restored to Italian administration (as is
                            the present practice with respect to liberated areas in southern Italy).
                            Allied Military Government would thus be maintained until the disputed
                            areas are finally disposed of by peace treaty or other settlement. Any
                            other course, such as letting the Tito forces occupy the Peninsula or
                            Free Austrian forces occupy the South Tyrol prior to final disposition
                            at the peace settlement, would undoubtedly prejudice the final
                            disposition of these territories, cause deep resentment <pb n="486"
                                xml:id="pg_486" facs="0550"/>on the part of the Italian people, and
                            result in the loss of considerable prestige by the Allies in Italy.</p>
                        <p>The British have already suggested a plan along these lines and would, it
                            is believed, be willing to maintain Allied Military Government in
                            frontier areas likely to be in dispute for the required period. It is
                            reported that this is also the plan of the Supreme Allied Commander,
                            Mediterranean Theater,<note n="3" xml:id="d293fn3">General Sir Henry

                            Peninsula. On our part, it would mean keeping a certain number of
                            American Military Government officers and soldiers in Northeastern
                            Italy.</p>

                                    prepared with a view to its use in the Roosevelt-Churchill
                                    conversations at Hyde Park. It is clear from the covering
                                    memorandum quoted below that it was written in ignorance of the
                                    existence of the Roosevelt-Churchill minute of September 15,
                                    1944, on the subject of recognition of the French Committee of
                                    National Liberation (see <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_469">p. 469</ref>). Hull’s memorandum was not
                                    transmitted directly to Roosevelt at Hyde Park, but was sent to
                                    Hopkins under cover of the following memorandum from the Deputy
                                    Director of the Office of European Affairs (Matthews):</p>
                                <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Harry</hi>: I took this up personally
                                    with the Secretary and he is in full agreement with the policy
                                    recommended in the memorandum. The Secretary has approved its
                                    immediate transmission to the President. I leave to your
                                    judgment whether to present it to the President now in view of
                                    the speed with which events are developing, or whether you think
                                    it better for the Secretary to take it up personally with the
                                    President upon his return. Without knowing whether the question
                                    came up at Quebec, I am inclined to feel the sooner we get
                                    moving on this the better. …Very sincerely, Doc.” (Hopkins
                                    Papers) This covering memorandum was dated September 18, 1944,
                                    and as Hopkins arrived at Hyde Park at noon on that day (see
                                    Leahy, <ref target="#pg_263">p. 263</ref>), Hull’s memorandum
                                    could not have reached Hopkins before the latter left Washington
                                    for Hyde Park. The presence of the ribbon copy of Hull’s
                                    memorandum in the Hopkins Papers and a note of September 23,
                                    1944, by Hopkins establish that the Hull memorandum of September
                                    17 did not reach Roosevelt before Churchill’s departure from
                                    Hyde Park. Hopkins’ memorandum of September 23 stated: “I talked
                                    to Matthews about this. He tells me that the Secretary sent a
                                    further note to the President on this same subject and that this
                                    memo [Hull’s memorandum of September 17], therefore, need not be
                                    delivered.” (Hopkins Papers) For the text of the “further note”
                                    referred to, which was dated September 21, and with which Hull
                                    enclosed a copy of the memorandum of September 17, see <ref

                            Recognition by Principal Allied Governments of a Provisional Government

                        <p>In my opinion the time has come to give serious consideration to the
                            question of announcing this Government’s recognition of the <hi

                            dropped until after general elections are held in France.</p>
                        <p>I believe that this step is not inconsistent with the policy which we
                            have carefully followed, namely, to refrain from any action which might
                            have the effect of impairing the opportunity of the French people freely
                            to exercise their will in the choice of their leaders.</p>
                        <p>The following factors suggest the advisability of taking this step at

                                important for us to reach agreement about the treatment of these
                                major criminals. Would you consider whether a list could not be
                                prepared of say 50 to 100 persons whose responsibilities for
                                directing or impelling the whole process of crime and atrocity is
                                established by the fact of their holding certain high offices? Such
                                a list would not of course be exhaustive. New names could be added
                                at any time. It is proposed that these persons should be declared,
                                on the authority of the United Nations, to be world outlaws and that
                                upon any of them falling into Allied hands the Allies will “decide
                                how they are to be disposed of and the execution of this decision
                                will be carried out immediately”. Or alternatively, “the nearest
                                General Officer will convene a Court for the sole purpose of
                                establishing their identity, and when this has been done will have
                                them shot within one hour without reference to higher
                                authority”.</item>

                            <item>It would seem that the method of trial, conviction and judicial
                                sentence is quite inappropriate for notorious ringleaders such as
                                Hitler, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels and Ribbentrop. Apart from the
                                formidable difficulties of constituting the Court, formulating the
                                charge and assembling the evidence, the question of their fate is a
                                political and not a judicial one. It could not rest with judges
                                however eminent or learned to decide finally a matter like this
                                which is of the <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0554"/>widest and
                                most vital public policy. The decision must be “the joint decision
                                of the Governments of the Allies”. This in fact was expressed in the
                                Moscow Declaration.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>There would seem to be advantages in publishing a list of names.
                                At the present time, Hitler and his leading associates know that
                                their fate will be sealed when the German Army and people cease to
                                resist. It therefore costs them nothing to go on giving orders to
                                fight to the last man, die in the last ditch, etc. As long as they
                                can persuade the German people to do this, they continue to live on
                                the fat of the land and have exalted employments. They represent
                                themselves and the German people as sharing the same rights and
                                fate. Once however their names are published and they are isolated,
                                the mass of the German people will infer rightly that there is a
                                difference between these major criminals and themselves. A
                                divergence of interests between the notorious leaders and their
                                dupes will become apparent. This may lead to undermining the
                                authority of the doomed leaders and to setting their own people
                                against them, and thus may help the break up of Germany.</item>

                                to you certain anxieties which are much in our minds about political
                                developments in Europe. With the defeat of the enemy’s armies,
                                political problems will arise in all parts of Europe. It is
                                essential that we should work together to solve these. We mention in
                                particular the situation in Yugoslavia and Greece, in both of which
                                countries there has been, and in the former of which there still is,
                                the danger of civil war. There is also the position in Poland, which
                                causes us much anxiety. We were all much encouraged by the success
                                of the visit of Monsieur Mikołajczyk, the Polish Prime Minister, to
                                Moscow, and we hope that the conversations which were there opened
                                can be carried to a successful conclusion with your help. It would
                                be gravely embarrassing to the smooth working of our affairs if
                                events should so fall out that we were left recognizing Monsieur
                                Mikołajczyk and his Government while you supported some other

                                    paragraph in this <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> appears
                                    from a memorandum of September 22, 1944, by the Director of the
                                    Office of Scientific Research and Development (Bush) concerning
                                    a conference with Roosevelt which Bush had attended on that date
                                    at which Leahy and Cherwell were also present Bush recorded:</p>
                                <p>“The President stated that Mr. Justice Frankfurter had visited
                                    him a few weeks ago and expressed himself as very much worried
                                    about the future handling in the post-war period of matters
                                    pertaining to the secret project. The President apparently
                                    professed ignorance of what Frankfurter was talking about,
                                    although do not know how far this went, and I certainly gained
                                    the impression that the President did not tell Frankfurter any
                                    more than he knew when he came. Frankfurter insisted that Bohr
                                    should see the President, as he and Bohr had discussed the
                                    future state of the world from this standpoint and Bohr had some
                                    very striking ideas. This was apparently arranged and the
                                    President had seen Bohr for a short time and listened to him.
                                    The President, however, was very much disturbed in regard to
                                    security and wished to know how far Bohr had been taken into the
                                    matter, whether he was trusted, and also how Mr. Frankfurter
                                    happened to know anything about the subject whatever. Lord
                                    Cherwell traced the history of Bohr’s escape from Denmark, his
                                    introduction to this country, and so on. He stated that Bohr had
                                    similarly seen the Prime Minister after having insisted on doing
                                    so in Britain and had told him his ideas about future handling
                                    of this subject. These ideas, I believe, revolve about immediate
                                    disclosure of the subject, its use as a threat against Germany,
                                    and similar matters, and also a control by the British and
                                    Americans of the subject after the war, and I judge the
                                    maintenance of a peace by the Anglo-Americans on this basis. I
                                    then traced the way Bohr had been introduced into this country
                                    and in particular the care that had been taken to be sure that
                                    he was handled in such a manner that we became sure of his
                                    discretion before introducing him to parts of the project Both
                                    Cherwell and I brought out the fact that he was a very important
                                    physicist who had been able to contribute and also that he had
                                    given us some ideas as to what was going on in Germany that were
                                    quite valuable. It also appeared in this discussion that Bohr
                                    had been invited by the Russians to visit Russia but had
                                    declined.” (A.E.C. Files, Historical Document No. 185)</p>

                            Italy was postponed at Eden’s request. Eden’s comments on the draft

                            memorandum from the British Embassy at Washington dated September 22,
                            1944, were as follows: <quote rend="blockquote"><list>
                                    <item>“1. I much hope the President will agree to leave out
                                        paragraph referring to a revision of long armistice terms.
                                        We did not include this in our original list of concessions
                                        because (i) to do so opens the whole of our position in
                                        relation to Italian surrender and would enable Italy to call
                                        in question all its provisions including fleet, colonies,
                                        etc., (ii) We could not do this without prior consultation
                                        with Russia who is also a party to armistice terms. To omit
                                        such consultation would cause great offence. Dominions who
                                        have also approved armistice terms would certainly expect
                                        consultation before any announcement was made. It should
                                        also be remembered that long armistice terms have never been
                                        made public and that military authorities have hitherto been
                                        unwilling to do so. Parliament would certainly press to see
                                        terms if their revision is announced.</item>

                                        supplies for child welfare and displaced persons. Therefore
                                        it seems unwise to mention specifically foodstuffs and
                                        clothing which would certainly make more difficult the task
                                        of our representatives at <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1"
                                            >UNRRA</gloss> in obtaining agreement. I suggest
                                        therefore that these words ‘foodstuffs and clothing’ should
                                        be left out.</item>

                                        present worded with its reference to exchange of goods would
                                        give Italy privileged position over all our allies and
                                        ourselves and would undermine United States-United Kingdom
                                        supply machinery. To avoid this danger I suggest that in

                        <p>Following a telegraphic exchange (not printed) between Roosevelt and
                            Churchill, the British Embassy informed the White House on September 26,
                            1944, that the British War Cabinet had approved the release of the
                            statement, as amended, for the morning papers of the following day. The
                            Embassy also suggested a further amendment to bring up to date the
                            paragraph relating to the session of the Council of the United Nations
                            Relief and Rehabilitation Administration which was then meeting at
                            Montreal. This amendment was accepted and the statement was released to
                            the press in Washington late on September 26, 1944, for the morning

                        <p>The President and the Prime Minister held further discussions Monday and
                            Tuesday, September 18 and 19, at Hyde Park, on subjects dealing with
                            post-war policies in Europe. The result of these discussions cannot be
                            disclosed at this time for strategic military reasons, and pending their
                            consideration by our other Allies.</p>
                        <p>The present problems in Italy also came under discussion, and on this
                            subject the President and the Prime Minister issued the following
                            statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Italian people, freed of their Fascist and Nazi
                                    overlordship, have in these last twelve months demonstrated
                                    their will to be free, to fight on the side of the democracies,
                                    and to take a place among the United Nations devoted to
                                    principles of peace and justice.</p>
                                <p>“We believe we should give encouragement to those Italians who
                                    are standing for a political rebirth in Italy, and are
                                    completing the destruction of the evil Fascist system. We wish
                                    to afford the Italians a greater opportunity to aid in the
                                    defeat of our common enemies.</p>
                                <p>“The American and the British people are of course horrified by
                                    the recent mob action in Rome, but feel that a greater
                                    responsibility placed on the Italian people and on their own
                                    government will most readily prevent a recurrence of such
                                    acts.</p>
                                <p>“An increasing measure of control will be gradually handed over
                                    to the Italian Administration, subject of course to that
                                    Administration’s <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0562"
                                    />proving that it can maintain law and order and the regular
                                    administration of justice. To mark this change the Allied
                                    Control Commission will be renamed ‘The Allied Commission.’</p>
                                <p>“The British High Commissioner in Italy will assume the
                                    additional title of Ambassador. The United States representative
                                    in Rome already holds that rank. The Italian Government will be
                                    invited to appoint direct representatives to Washington and
                                    London.</p>
                                <p>“First and immediate considerations in Italy are the relief of
                                    hunger and sickness and fear. To this end we instructed our
                                    representatives at the <gloss target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss>
                                    Conference to declare for the sending of medical aids and other
                                    essential supplies to Italy. We are happy to know that this view
                                    commended itself to other members of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_UNRRA1">UNRRA</gloss> Council.</p>
                                <p>“At the same time, first steps should be taken toward the
                                    reconstruction of an Italian economy—an economy laid low under
                                    the years of the misrule of Mussolini, and ravished by the
                                    German policy of vengeful destruction.</p>
                                <p>“These steps should be taken primarily as military aims to put
                                    the full resources of Italy and the Italian people into the
                                    struggle to defeat Germany and Japan. For military reasons we
                                    should assist the Italians in the restoration of such power
                                    systems, their railways, motor transport, roads and other
                                    communications as enter into the war situation, and for a short
                                    time send engineers, technicians and industrial experts into
                                    Italy to help them in their own rehabilitation.</p>
                                <p>“The application to Italy of the Trading with the Enemy Acts
                                    should be modified so as to enable business contacts between
                                    Italy and the outside world to be resumed for the benefit of the
                                    Italian people.</p>
                                <p>“We all wish to speed the day when the last vestiges of Fascism
                                    in Italy will have been wiped out, and when the last German will
                                    have left Italian soil, and when there will be no need of any
                                    Allied troops to remain—the day when free elections can be held
                                    throughout Italy, and when Italy can earn her proper place in
                                    the great family of free nations.”</p>
